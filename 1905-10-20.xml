                    <p>British Chamber or Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and
                        mer- chants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which
                        was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also
                        includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber, Home enquirers
                        can obtain further particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street,

                    <head>THE "ARAB AWAKENING" </head>
                    <p>Sometime ago we recieved a copy of M Neguib Azoury's interesting and
                        suggestive work, "Le Reveil de la Nation Arabe," an elo quent plea for the
                        revival of an Arab Caliphastic extedning from the Yemen to Aleppo and from
                        Oman to the hills of Kurdistan. We have no fault to find with M. Axoury's
                        essay as a propagandist appeal to certain Arabic speaking peoples, but in
                        out opinion the "Arab Nation" of which the author speak with such fire and
                        eloquence does not exist And those who count on the spiritual an mental
                        development of Arabia as a factor in the politics of the Near East will be
                        grievoual disappointed. All who have followed the history of the peninsula
                        since the beginning the Wahabi "revival" realise that, thus fa every
                        movement among the Arab clans ha been reactionary and conservative. Wha ever
                        the religions zeal of the Wahal leaders, their whole policy was so bigoted
                        and savage, that the capture of Dereyeeyah Ibrahim Pasha proved a relief not
                        only Arabia, but to the whole Moslem world The present Emir of Hail, Abdul
                        Aziz Hashid, who resembles his famous uncle Mohamed ibn Rashid, the Bedounin
                        lord the Nejd, has paid for his dynasty's tolerable of strangers and freedom
                        from religion bigotry by losing the greater part of his tertories to the
                        Wahabi chiefs of the house Sa'ud. From all accounts the present of the
                        Yemen, who is apparently eager to continue a guerilla warfare in the arid
                        mountains of Arabia "Felix," is in no way in advance his neighbours. The
                        very fact that the Turb faed by terrible geographical and climate
                        difficulties, and hampered by their own la of organization, have been able
                        to established their authority over the whole western seaboat of Arabia and,
                        if the latest reports are accurate over a part Of the Nejd, proves the
                        capacity of the pare Arabs for any sort political union. The Caliphates of
                        Baghdad, the Arab kingdoms of N. Africa, Syria, and Egypt were founded by
                        Arabs and ruled monarchs of more or less Arab descence but their peoples
                        were never Arab as whole, though they were modified by Ai elements. The
                        "Arab" of modern Egypt largely mixed with Coptic blood, and the sical
                        difference between a pore-bred' dew Arab end a fellah is almost as great aa
                        that tween an Abyssinian and a Circassian. Arab speakers of Syria, Barbary,
                        and Irak in the majority of cases Arabised Syria Kabylee, or Chaldeans, and
                        when we hear the Arab awakening we should like to know what section of the
                        "Arab" peoples it applies Syria and Egypt have progressed, Arabia mains in
                        the tribal stage, and that pure like a true son of the desert, prefers his
                        independence to Empire-building. His infuence has been kinetic rather than
                        construction. His independence and strength of character have enabled him to
                        rule over less vigor races, end to impact some of his own to them, but the
                        very excess of these excellent qualities keeps Arabia hundreds of years
                        behind the rest of the Moslem world. when tribe neutralises tribe the way is
                        for the persistant Turk, who has at least, of political construction, and
                        certainly stands that Empire-building is impossed without the subordination
                        of the individualism. </p>

                                at Richmond, he said that it is possible to give the neighbour- ing

                        present, as were Harari Pasha, the Hon. A. J. Davey, M. Naus, and many

                        ing the conduct of previous auditors of the company's accounts. On the other

                        weighs only too heavily on some of the directors, thanks to the publication
                        of correspondence ex- changed between him and M. Cronier which proves that

                    <p>Dear M. Cronier, - I have received your wire and forward you a copy thereof
                        under the same cover. I have not replied by wire, preferring to explain to
                        you by letter the features of a situation which has become impossible for me
                        in consequence of the underhand proceedings at my expense, that have
                        continued too long. The actual point of difference is on the question of my
                        rights of control and authority, in my capacity as the only administrator-
                        delegate present here, and not on the question of the inde- pendence allowed
                        to M. Ninci in his conduct of our commercial affairs, for I have never in
                        any way impeded the carrying out of the services confided to M. Ninci and
                        defy any one to prove the contrary. Concealment of the truth is not my way
                        of doing business, and as fat as services towards the successful prosecution
                        of our business are concerned I have done as much as others who appear to
                        have more to show. The future will prove my statement. </p>
                    <p>Here are the facts. One day last week I asked to see and sign the letters
                        containing orders. I made a point of keeping myself well informed about the
                        business of this bureau, whether all the orders were properly transmitted to
                        Paris, whether directors of the factories did not demand impossible amounts,
                        the price of purchases, - in a word, I carried out quietly and
                        conscientiously the functions which are mine by right as administrator-
                        delegate, and I did my best to do my duty. </p>
                    <p>M. Ninci was vexed, and promptly proceeded to telegraph, I have no notion
                        why. In short, when I called upon him to explain his attitude, he replied-
                        and I beg you to note his reply- that he was the representative of M. de la
                        Bouglise during my colleague's absence, and that in consequences he was my
                        equal, and that I had no right to give him any orders whatever, or ask
                        whether he was at Alexandria, or Cairo, or elsewhere. Leaving the personal
                        attitude of M. Nincy out of the question I ask you in all frank- ness
                        whether that is the way for him to behave towards me; If you approve his
                        attitude,- which I refuse to believe- what is my position here. </p>
                    <p>Now, as for the question of my irrespond- disability for M. Ninci's
                        proceedings, allow me to say that maybe all very well between out- selves,
                        but that to the shareholders, the public, and the Government authorities I
                        remain -and I am - administrator delegate, and whatever my confidence in M.
                        Ninci, I cannot admit that I have no right of control over our employee, or
                        that any inferior can deny my authority, however indirectly. In your own
                        case you ought to know well enough that at your distance you cannot have all
                        the means of control desirable to enable you to take upon yourself the
                        responsibility for akk M. Ninci's acts. Finally, if I accepted this
                        situation, I should simply become a man of straw with a title and a name
                        that would be lent to our business and a complete ignorance of its nature. I
                        may remind you that Lord Dufferin made a similar mistake, and I decline to
                        accept such a situation. You must also be aware of the con- stant
                        difficulties that have appeared among our board. I consider that our
                        business cannot co-exist with these internal dis sessions. On that account I
                        can say that, were I to retire, my retirement might profit the company, the
                        board, and the committee of director. Therefore, if under the circumstances
                        you disapprove of my views as to my right of control and authority as the
                        only administrator-delegate present here. I have to inform you that I cannot
                        continue my functions. If you disagree with my views I should not propose to
                        leave you suddenly, but should look our for some other position in Egypt,
                        where I intend to stay permanently. </p>
                    <p>Before I close, I ought to tell you, to give you full information about the
                        incident, that M. Naua, on being questioned by me before M. Ninci, loyally
                        and absolutely recognized my rights of control, and my authority based on my
                        position of administrator- delegate. M. Naus has done his best to persuade
                        M. Ninci to accept our point of view, and as M. Ninci refuses to yield I am
                        obliged to forward you this ex- planation. I am keeping M. Leroux in- formed
                        as to the situation and beg you to accept the assurance of my sincere
                        personal friendship.- ARTHUR J. DAVEY </p>
                    <p>The reading of the report was followed by a brief speech from Me. Carton de
                        Wiart, who remarked that the experts seemed not to have touched at all on
                        certain interesting points, Judge Tuck here interposing that the Sucre- rise
                        Company's shareholders and creditors were also interesting enough. Maltre
                        Carton de Wiart the proceeded to say that in the inte- resta both of the
                        company and the shareholders their present expectant attitude could not be
                        indefinitely maintained, and that a period of four weeks would be necessary
                        for the experts to complete their task. The documents read had been most
                        interesting, but the company had to find out whether the business should be
                        carried on, and in four weeks they would be ready to give an immediate
                        answer on the receipt of the final report of the experts. The final report
                        will therefore be submitted to the Court and read on Thursday, Novem- ber
                        16. </p>

                    <p>The quarterly statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund contains a very
                        interesting Account of some discoveries at Gezer during Excavations now
                        terminated by lapse of the Firman. Mr Stewart Macalister has found a
                        Connected series of artificial caves, which Obviously have been used as
                        burial places. Most Of them have been plundered at an early date, Probably
                        about 600 B.C., and by workmen who Broke into them when excavating cisterns
                        in The limestone rock. Here and there, however, A few things escaped their
                        notice, and one Deposit was untouched. Besides pottery, Mr. Mcollister found
                        some beats, one or two objects in ivory, a few gold ornaments, and Several
                        soarabe, sometimes is gold or silver amounts. These were of various
                        materials, and All belong to the Middle Egyptian Empire, or About 2500 B.C.,
                        an approximate date which Accords with the pottery. In the floor of one
                        Chamber are numerous cup-marks, of unusually Large size, and arranged in
                        rude oval patterns. This rock-hewn cemetery was probably closed More than
                        four thousand years ago, and I first Disclosed by the oyster-sinkers some
                        fifteen Centuries later. This throws light on a fact which Hitherto has
                        perplexed the explorers. In the Upper debris at Greger, Middle Empire
                        scarabs Are rather unusually abundant, mixed with Late Assyrian remains. The
                        plunder of these Tombs would "let loose a flood of scarabs" Over the city,
                        and bring about this inter- Picture of ancient Egyptian with the modern
                        Assyrian. Remains of importance have been Found in other parts of Gezer,
                        including two Tombs, constructed of masonry, and contain- Ing skeletons in
                        an extended position, the Date of which is probably about 1000B.C. (in One
                        was an iron knite). But the rock-out Cemetery has a special interest, by
                        proving a Close intercourse between Egypt and Palestine During the Middle
                        Empire, and indirectly, as Mr, Macalister shows, by adding to the proba-
                        bility that the early date for King Naram-Sin asserted by Nabonaid of
                        Assyria was correct. </p>

                        of this year. Drury Bey will be absent about three weeks. Kaimakam Longfield
                        Bey, R.E, Acting Director of Railways, went to Railhead yester- day, taking
                        with him a special material train, which will be the first to go through to
                        Others. The train also takes a turntable, which will be put down at Athara.
                        To-day Longfield Bey will meet Midwinter Bey at the two Railheads, and the
                        last rail will be put down to join both ends. Thus the long-expected work
                        will be completed. Time-tables are now being made here, and from the 16th
                        inst. Trains will run Daily from Suakin to Athara, the run occupying about
                        80 hours. A slow rate of speed will have to be maintained until the bridges
                        are completed.</p>
                    <p>The German steamer Weissenfels arrived here from England on the 12th inst.

                        hor- rible end. He was engaged in making some repairs in the engine-room on

                        looking to see whether Mr. Mavros had left the crank pit or not, set the

                        it, Mr. Mavroe was crushed and mangled beyond recognition. His remains were
                        brought ashore in a sack, and were buried yesterday afternoon. Mr. Mavros,

                        nom de tous mes collègues de la Commission. Loin d'etre tombée, cotte
                        Commission — épurée do certains éléments nuisibles qui s'étaient glissés
                        dans sein et rencuvelée aprèi l'épuration en question — est aujourd'hui plus
                        forte et plus résolue que jamais.</p>
                    <p>Depuis sa fondation, et malgré tontes les basses machinations qui ont été
                        onrdies pour la faire, avorter, la Commission ne s'est jamais laissée
                        décourager par qui et par quoi que ca soit et, à'juste titre, elle peut être
                        Gère du travail accompli.</p>
                    <p>Elle a travaillé silencieusoment, o'est vrai 1 mais elle avi^t de graves
                        raisons pour agir ainsi ; et, lorsque, bientot, il loi sera permis do rendre
                        compte des bons résultats obtenu, non seulement elle confondra ses
                        détracteurs, mais elle prouvera à ses mendants qu'elle n'a jamais cessé un
                        seûl instant d'être digne do leur confiance.</p>
                    <p>Devant tant d'énergio et tant de ténacité, les autorités ont fini pV
                        s'émouvoir et nous promettre de .s'intéresser è la cause si haute- ment
                        humanitaire que nous nous sommes juré de défendre jusqu'au bout</p>
                    <p>Il est des secrets qui ne m'appartiennent point; mais sans me départure de la
                        réserve qui m'est imposée, je puis, cependant, déclarer hautement que nous
                        rommos désormais, tout près du but</p>
                    <p>Cotte déclaration pourra peut-être déplaire è quelques-uns, mais je suis
                        certain qu'elle eau sera une légitime satisfaction aux nombreux
                        philanthropes qui s'intéressent h la solution d'an aussi grave problème

                        <p>If you will tell me what is going to be the future of the Money market,
                            then I am prepared to give a forecast of the prices of stocks and shares
                            in tho immediate future. This is tho reply one has received throughout
                            the week from most of tho leading financiers whom discussing the
                            movements of stocks and shares. It would seem for the moment that the
                            money market entirely dominates the situation, even the Delcassé
                            exposure and the animosity which is being displayed by the German Press
                            has had practically no effect on Stock Exchange values, as the incident
                            is not looked upon in so serious a light as some of the less responsible
                            newspapers would have us believe. </p>

                        <p>Whilst no alteration was made in tho Bank rate yesterday, still in
                            Lombard-street discount is rates remained firm — the result, no doubt,
                            of the poor showing of tho Bank return. There was a considerable enquiry
                            for gold for Paris, but as no transactions took place no prices is
                            transpired. The Bank reserve now amounts to only £10,586,000, which is a
                            decline of nearly in £400,000. since our last. Over £500,000 of gold is
                            expected to reach the Bank to-morrow. On tho other hand, £1,000,000 of
                            gold which was shipped on account of the Indian paper currency reserve
                            is, we learn, to be landed in Egypt, which will mean a similar amount of
                            depletion to the Bank of England's stock.</p>

                        <p>Consols have been a more or less weak market in consequence of the money
                            situation during the past week. They close to-day at 88 3/4. The
                            bungling of the sale of a large block of lndian Threes, due to tho
                            difficulties of to a firm of jobbers in the American market, and also
                            the fact that a well-known firm of brokers were reported to be under the
                            necessity of liquidating on a heavy scale to meet the differ- ences of
                            clients, brought the price of these down from 96 3/8 to 95 1/8. This had
                            its effect on other similar securities,, which were dull all yesterday,
                            but leave off with a slightly better tone to day.</p>

                            have been sailing on a fairly even keel all the week, and show
                            practically no difference in price. They are quoted tonight at 100 1/2.
                            A fair demand has put up the prim of Egyptian Unifieds at least 1/2.
                            There seems to be a good deal of attention given to the Egyptian market
                            generally at the present time. National and Agricultural Bank shares
                            show little change from our last and leave off at 27 1/2 and 9 3/4

                        <p>It will interest your readers to know what happened on Tuesday at the
                            meeting of the shareholders of the Say Refinery Company. The result of
                            this meeting was that, although at one time the 1,200 shareholders
                            showed a good deal of dissatisfaction at the ignorance displayed on the
                            directors as to the transaction! of M. Cronisr, still in the end they
                            almost unanimously voted for the directors' proposa! for reconstruction.
                            The scheme of reorganisation they agreed upon was as follows. The
                            capital at present 32,250,000 francs, in 76,500 shares of francs each,
                            is to be reduced to 15,300,0001 by making tho nominal amount of each of
                            the present shares 200/. instead of 500f Fresh capital is to be obtained
                            by the issue of 114,750 new 200f. shares, which will bring the total
                            capital up to tho original amount. The new shares will bo issued at a
                            premium of 40f. 30f. of which will be played te the reserve and lOf. set
                            aside for the expanses and guarantee ing of the issue. Tho shares will
                            be payable immediately, and will be entitled to partake it the profits
                            from October 1st.</p>
                        <p>Although several of the shareholders would have liked to have had a tall
                            discussion on the to acts of the late mauaging director, this was
                            thought inadvisable at the present time, and was adjourned until the
                            general meeting, which is to take place in November next.</p>

                            Consols, and con sequently, not with stannding the favorable trade
                            advices and traffic of the last week, they leave off lower than they
                            would otherwise have done. The American market is still in a waiting
                            attitude, and is no doubt affected by the con- servative report of Mr.
                            Vauderlip, of the National City Bank, who advises caution. Grand Tranks
                            did not respond to the favorable state- ment as to prospecte at the

                    <p>SCHEME OF REORGANISATION ADOPTED.</p>
                    <p>The extraordinary meeting of the sharehold- ers of the above com par y held
                        in Paris on the 10th inst. (of which a brief account has already appeared in
                        the "Gazette") was presid- Ed over by M. Peytel, and there was a very large
                        attendance.</p>
                    <p>Tho chairman, in opening the proceedings, "We have called yon together today
                        to lay before yon tho unfortnate position of this company, brought about by
                        the deplorable act of tho late Provident, who died on the 27th of August
                        last under conditions of which you are aware. Let me recall, first of all.
                        in what man- ner the management of this company was organised. Our object is
                        entirely an industrial one. Oor business in Paris was to buy sugar, to
                        refine it and sell it at the highest price to the home trade. The surplus
                        production we export'd. In the provinces our business was to buy beetroot,
                        extract tho sugar from the kiot- root in the six factories which you
                        possess, and to sell the beetroot to the highest bidder. No doubt the
                        purchase of beet and the purchase and sale of sugar necessitate numerous and
                        intricate commericial operations. There are sugar stocks to be obtained at
                        the right mo- ment, but the risks should not degenerate into market
                        speculations. Jour directors would never have sanctioned * ch speculations,
                        and until a recent dite they supposed that the negotiations had been
                        conducted in an orthodox manner."</p>
                    <p>At this point there were load and noisy interruptions, and shoots of "Yon
                        knew all about it!"</p>
                    <p>"Gentlemen, please allow mo to proceed r appeaered the Chairman. ' When the
                        late M. Henri Say became ill, and personal considera- tious determined him
                        to sell his refinery in Paris and the sugar works at Pont d'Ardres, it was
                        felt that this important business could only be properly carried on by those
                        who had been for long years connected with the founder, M. Henri Say, in the
                        conduct of the concern. Them were M. Cronier, ex chief Government Engineer
                        of Roads and Bridges, also M. P6 lissier. who had charge for twenty years
                        past of the technical department, M. Tellerman, the commercial manager, M.
                        Letort, the adminis- trator, and M. Leroux. All bad been connected from
                        fifteen to twenty years with the business. We paid these men limited
                        salaries, but gave them a large share in the profits of the busi- ness. We
                        would remind you that M. Henri Say and Company did not transfer to this com-
                        pany all the r business, but continued to work on their own account tho
                        .Egyptian Refinery and Sugar Works and the Electro Sugar Works, and MM.
                        Cronier and Teller- man continued in an occasional way to lend Messrs Henri
                        8ay the benefit of their ex- perience.</p>

                    <p>"Now, gentlemen, yon know the result of the first six years of our existence.
                        It, in brief enabled us to realise the sum of £1,255,800 in net profit,
                        after payment of all expenses and Shares to the management. We find,
                        however, from a rapid investigation of the books that of this sum we shall
                        have to write off £73,600 from the profits for 1904 in consequence of surdry
                        illicit manipulations of figures in the books. Wo shall also be obliged to
                        place £413,960 in a sinking fund.</p>
                    <p>"The seventh year's business, which began on the 1st of October, 1904,
                        promised to be excellent. The sugar campaign bad been very good and left net
                        profits amounting to £156,000 In April last tbs fall in the price of sugar
                        was outlined, bit we did not expect the fall to seriously interfere with the
                        net profits already acquired. At most, the consequence of the fall in sugar
                        might have decreased our profits during the last half-year. According to the
                        information supplied to us by our manage- ment, we bad bought our sugar at a
                        reasonable price, and these purchases were practically covered by the sales
                        which we bad made in anticipation. Not only so, but a large portion of the
                        sugar for 1905 was sold in advance. The general condition of the stocks and
                        the fall in prices did not lead tie to expect any very considerable margin
                        in prices. Such was the position as it was represented to year Said by the
                        management, when suddenly, like a thundar-clap, the news of M. Cromer's
                        suicide came.</p>

                    <p>"We have already pointed out that MM. Henri Say and Co. had continued to work
                        side bv side with us with M. Say as the maaver. When M. Say died our general
                        manager, M. Cronier, who had been previously appointed by the chief partners
                        of the firm to be the ad minister and liquidator of Messers Henri Say and
                        Co., took over the conduct of the business while still continuing to be our
                        general manager. The credit of the firm of Henri Say and Co. took over the
                        conduct of the and uncontested until the raws of M. Cronier's suicide It was
                        well knows that the fins po» w»sed most valrable assets and there was no
                        reason to believe that these IM been gander ed. Indeed, M. Crontier's own
                        personality, his reputation for ability, contributed to maintain the credit
                        of the firm; and I need only point to the fact that the leading Paris banks

                    <p>"It was on Sunday, the 97th of August, that we heard of tbs suicide of M.

                        commited his rash act in consequence of personal embarrassments, but we did
                        not then suppose that there would ultimately turn out to be a veritable
                        disaster. On the following Tuesday, after a most anxious investigation into
                        the book*, your Board awoke to the gravity of the position. In fact we
                        discovered that the company was deeply compromised as a result of M.
                        Cronier's business methods. He had made heavy purchases in Prance and still
                        p heavier purchases . abroad in the name of the company, thus making us
                        liable. He bad also given the company's gnarar.tr o to back certain. bills
                        which he issued as liquidator of Messrs. Henri 8ay and Co. He bad also got
                        our bankers to advance to Messrs. Henri Say and Co. without our knowing
                        anything about the matter, a sum of no less than £880,000. I assert, gentle-
                        men, that these facts were absolutely unknown to your Board."</p>
                    <p>There were loud protests at there words, and r cries of "It is impossible

                        shareholders present, the Chairman went on to explain at great length the
                        circumstance connected with M. Cronier's malversations, from which it
                        appeared that he had improperly converted to other uses a sum of £1,010,000,
                        being the f moneys of. the company. The events which had taken place since

                        un- fortunate expedition. The Geographical Society of Stockhelm, however,
                        has taken the matter in hand, and has commissioned Londberg, the Swedish
                        engraver, to make a large memorial medal. The artist represents Andre's
                        balloon rising from the ice. The explorer is looking anxiously towards the
                        North. A group of young men are applauding, while an old man looks , towards
                        the horizon doubtfully. Below is the , date July 11, 1897. On the obverse
                        appears the profile of Andree, with his name and the names of his
                        companions, Sternberg and Fraenkel.</p>

                    <head>THE CANAL FROM THE CASPIAN TO THE PERSIAN GULF</head>
                    <p>Particulars of the German scheme for a canal to unite the Caspian Sea with
                        the Per- Sian Gulf are furnished by the Paris "Eclair." It is intended, of
                        course, to counterbalance the British plan prepared by Sir William
                        Willoocks, whose idea is to render the Tigris navigable as far as Diarbekir,
                        where it would meet a railway line from Smyrna. The German plan, elaborated
                        by Herr Waechtor, is to join Baghdad, the highest point of naviga- bility of
                        the Tigris, to Buzali on the Caspian Sea, by connecting the Djioalla, a
                        tributary of the Tigris, with the Kisil Usen, a river flowing into the
                        Caspian. To do this it will be necessary to construct a vast reservoir in
                        the mountains -dividing the two river basins, in order to provide water for
                        the Kisil Ueen, which is generally dried up daring the summer. It is, of
                        course, upoo the feasibility of this reservoir, which would have to attain
                        the proportions of one of the greet 8wi*s lakes, that the realisation of the
                        scheme depends. If deemed likely of success, Boteli would be connected with
                        the Russian railway yatem in Persia by a line running to Hamadan.</p>

                    <p>THE LESSON OF THE UGANDA RAILWAY.</p>
                    <p>At lint light it would appear that the days of romance in connection with the
                        Uganda Railway are ended. Not so many years ago we were entertained by
                        stories (officially guaran- teed aa true) of elephants clearing out the
                        hooking office* and of lion* carrying away pas- sangers from the carriages.
                        Bees stung to death one unfortunate black, and careless giraffes knocked
                        down the telegraph wires with 'hair unconcionably long necks. This last
                        difficulty ha* been obviated by raising the wires to seventeen feet
                        aboveground.</p>
                    <p>The latest report, just issued as a White Paper, is of a totally different
                        character. It is a mass of figures, with the elaborate tables of mileage
                        ran, cost of working,'average tonnage, and. other matters which repel all
                        but the rail- way expert or anxious shareholder. Yet if this average Briton
                        could be indeed to study the document—and the Uganda Railway is a national
                        asset in which all taxpayers are shareholders—he would find in it the tree
                        romance ; the wonder of a railway piercing to the heart of Africa and built
                        across deserts, forests, and mountains whose existence was scarcely dreamt
                        of in the youth of men not yet old, proving at once an economic success.</p>

                    <p>As sandwiched between the mass of figures presented are acme very pertinent
                        observations by there quiet men who serve Britain so well in the outposts of
                        empire, it may not be super- fluous to emphasise the points which an
                        attentive study of the return makes clear. The year 1904-5 is the first year
                        of full and uninterrupted traffic on the 584 miles of rails which link
                        Mombasa to the Victoria Nyanza. When the year began it was estimated that
                        there would be a deficit on the twelve months' working of '£15,000 (the
                        railway, it must be remembered was built for political reasons, and as a
                        groat blow to the slave trade, not on financial grounds, but the gross
                        earnings, £141,000, greatly exceeded the amount an- ticipated, with the
                        result that the expected deficit of £45,O0O was tamed into an actual net
                        profit of £i,600. This was due to two causes : the rash of settlers and the
                        rapid development of the staple product of the country. Over a thou and
                        white men came to the new land of promise, and it is gratifying to learn
                        that all the sound traders and tanners speak in high praise of the
                        potentialities of the country. Already some 3,000 tons of good and handled
                        monthly. The country produce,-ground nuts, fibres, hides, ivory, beans,
                        potatoes, chilies, etc.— comes largely from Uganda that is, it is brought to
                        the lake termenately steamer. So far, only the. districts close to the lake
                        ports are tapped, 'but this railway even now com- mands the trade of the
                        German part of the Nyanza, and has alto attracted goods from the Congo Free
                        State. There is no possible doubt as to the sound "divided" earning power of
                        the railway, and its officials are keenly alive to the wisdom of satisfying
                        the requirements of their customers in every legitimate way. Rates compare
                        not unfavorably with those ruling in South Africa to me it the needs of

                    <head>BRITISH STEAMSHIP LINE WANTED.</head>
                    <p>There is, however, a reverse side to the pic- ture, forcibly portrayed by Mr.
                        A. E. Crack- shank, the traffic manager. The railway is prospering, and
                        likely to prosper still more, but the laisser faire of British statesmen is
                        pre- venting England from reaping the full advan- tage of that circumstance.
                        At present almost all the produce brought down by the railway, as well as
                        the heavy goods brought to it, are carried to and from Mombasa in foreign
                        bot- toms. This important and expensive railway— the taxpayers have spent
                        over £5,300,000 on it —built entirely by Great Britain, is feeding French
                        and German (chiefly German) steam- ship lines. Surely it is time, as
                        recommended by Mr. Evelyn Cecil's committee, that a sub- sidised British
                        line be started. This is precisely one,of the occasions when to leave a job
                        half done is the worst of follies. A line of British steamers which would
                        serve all the ports in South-Bast Africa would regain much of the Zanxibar
                        and Mombasa trade now in the hands of foreign nations. Given favorable
                        shipping facilities and rates, the development of British Bast Africa and
                        Uganda would be much more rapid than it can otherwise be. The building of
                        the Uganda railway has proved "sane Imperialism" if anything ever has ; it
                        is no evidence of sanity to withhold the subsidiary steamship service.</p>

                        of the Belgian Congo. S0 lente, it is said, has the position Income that ;
                        here is every possibility of the regime collapa- Ing altogether, when, it is
                        suggested, Belgium should assume possession of the Free State. The
                        population cf the State is rapidly dwindl- ing, sonsequent upon the
                        conditions under Which the Administrations" is worked. The Rev. John H.
                        Harris, attached to the Balolo Mission, on the Upper Congo, is now in
                        London, fresh from the scenes of the horrible traffic in human flesh that
                        marks the Free State. Mr. Harris, with a devoted band of 30-workers, has for
                        the past seven years been working in the centre of the Abir district, where,
                        perhaps, the worst of the terrible atrocities have been perpetrated.</p>
                    <p>"There is no question about it," said Mr. Harris to a representative of 'The
                        Daily News" recently, "that the one solution to this fearful state of
                        affairs is an international conference ; until such is called nothing can be
                        done. Diplomatic negotiations are absolute- ly of no avail. Take a case in
                        point Lord Lasdowne was specifically promised by the Commission that all
                        witnesses would be tho- roughly protected. As a matter of fact, various
                        witnessses have been chased, captured. and transported to other districts,
                        and that by a man against whom the most fiendish outrages were alleged.</p>
                    <p>"Again, in spite cf Lord Lansdowne's pro- tests, the mission centres are
                        boycotted by the natives, at the instigation of the concession- naires. The
                        natives have been threatened with the direct punishment if they dare bring
                        us food, either flesh meat or vegetables; as a result we have, at great
                        expense, to import tinned foods in large quantities, because we have no
                        means of obtaining other.</p>
                    <p>"Would Belgium take over the Free State No, I don't think so. In the first
                        place, I don't think it has any desire to. When offered it in 190 , it
                        refuted, and asked that the matter should be postponed for ten years. Then
                        again, it must not be forgotten that England would never consent to such a
                        step. We had treaty rights on the Congo long before it became a Prei State,
                        and these would not be willingly handed over. Another thing is absolutely
                        cer- tain, England cannot and will not have the pre'eot regime carried on by
                        the Government of another country."</p>
                    <p>The honorary secretary of the Congo Reform Association assures our
                        contemporary in a telegram that the information given above is absolutely
                        correct The Congo State, he adds, is undoubtedly evacuating all the smaller
                        posts in the Stanley Pool district, while posts in the Kwango and Cataract
                        districts, together with those at Lokolela, Yambu, and Kwamout, are being
                        similarly dealt with. Most of them are lower Congo posts, and the motive is
                        ostensibly economy, coupled with shortage of personnel.</p>

                    <head>GRECO-ROUMANIAN CONFLICT.</head>
                    <p>The following view of the right nationality to be given to the Kutiovlaohs of
                        Macedonia is of interest, as coming from one of them- selves, and not from
                        either Greek or Rouma- nian efficial sources. He says :— "The truth is that
                        the majority of the Kutnvlaohs in Macedonia reckon themselves Greeks, and
                        repel the suggestion ofbelonging to the Roumanians. Most of the Greek bands
                        fighting against the Bulgarians in the south are made op of Kutsovlaohs. In
                        the mountain villages our shepperds speak besides Greek the Aromanian
                        dialect, especially the women. But if they need to write they most use the
                        Greek characters. Bat we, who live in the towns have forgotten the
                        dislect.</p>
                    <p>"In Monaatir.out of 8,600 Kuttovltoh-Greek families, only 31 have joined the
                        Roumanian propaganda, and so it is in other towos. The fistitions character
                        of the Roumanian agita- tation is best shown by the Committee. M. Douma was
                        born a Greek, Now he is head of the Roumanian Propaganda, with 80 Turkish
                        pounds a month. His lientenant is M. Set- drono, an Albanian, who was
                        educated at the expense of Bulgaria, and then turned his back on her, to
                        take up the agitation in Macedonia for the pay of £12 a week from
                        Roumania."</p>

                    <p>A Board of Trade report shows that the comen of the United Kingdom have
                        nearly twice as many chances of being married as have their alters in other
                        European countries. In the ten years from 1898 to 1903 the mar- risge rate
                        in the United Kingdom was from fourtoen to sixteen per thousand, while in
                        the rest of Europe the rate was between reran and eight per thousand. The
                        birth and death rates are shown to be decreasing generally. In spite of the
                        fewer births, the population of; the United State* has increased by
                        11,488,000 in eight years (mostly by immigration), .and that of the United
                        Kingdom in the same period by 1,160,000.</p>
