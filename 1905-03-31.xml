                    <p>The Customs Administration's statistics for</p>
                    <p>the trade of Egypt during the past year have </p>
                    <p>just been issued. There returns show an enormous </p>
                    <p>expansion in the volume of trade, which is greater than that of 1903 by more
                        than one</p>
                    <p>and quarter million starling in exports and</p>
                    <p>nearly font millions sterling in imports. Were weto consider the figures of
                        the gold coin imported (over £7,600,000) and exported (over £2,730,000) the
                        total increase would be found to be enormous.</p>
                    <p>Such trade statistics, of course, constitute only one of the indications of
                        the great wave of prosperity that is passing over the country. All other
                        criteria point unmistakably to the same conclusion. Banking and other
                        capital from foreign sources is pouring into Egypt; a new Limited liability
                        company appears almost daily, the price of land, both for agricultural and
                        building purposes, has risen enormously Egyp­tian securities on the local
                        and foreign market stand at quotations which dam the con­fidence of
                        investors in the future develop­ment of the country, and large blocks of
                        them have been taken off the. foreign markets by purchasers in Egypt; the
                        revenues increase notwithstanding continual reductions in taxa­tion ; the
                        population, both native and foreign, is waxing in numbers and in wealth, and
                        the standard of comfort of the former is ruing year by year.</p>
                    <p>In another column we have dealt with some aspects of Anglo-Egyptian trade,
                        typical y in regard to the shrinkage of our imports into Egypt. Much has
                        beau said about the want of enterprise of the British merchant as com­pared
                        with his foreign competitor*, and we are compelled to admit here in Egypt,
                        where them are ample opportunities of judging, that a great deal of it is
                        well-founded. Wo are aware that there are certain artificial disadvantages
                        against which British find it extremely difficult to contend, even in a
                        neutral market such as this. Dumping, for instance, will account for some of
                        the loss of trade in steel and cotton yam. But dumping will not serve to
                        explain the successful com­petition of our rivals in certain lines oi cotton
                        fabrics and in numerous less important articles of manufacture.</p>
                    <p>It is especially to these smaller branches of trade that we should like to
                        direct the attention of our countrymen, fur it is there that trade might be
                        built up to compensate for that which has been lost in the staple articles
                        oi British export, cotton and metal goods/- Although a growing market, Egypt
                        is not an easy one to work in, and its difficulties are apt to deter
                        new-comers from commencing operations. We may state in a few words what a
                        march*, intending business with Egypt must be on pared to do. He will
                        probably have to work.</p>
                    <p>credit terms, have an agent thoroughly) acquainted with the market, with whom
                        him must keep constantly in touch; his good) must be cheap, and adapted to
                        the taste and needs of the consumer. Our enterprising rival* from
                        Continental countries have been working the market assiduously on these
                        lines for many yean. To the success of their</p>
                    <p>j efforts the trade returns are sufficient tons of money. </p>

                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT). </byline>
                    <dateline>Assiout, March 26.</dateline>
                    <p>I mentioned in my last correspondence that crime in Assidut was increasing
                        terribly and that this state of things was mainly due to there being
                        something wrong with the police. [I will give two casesia proof of this
                        contention. </p>
                    <p>Four days ago, a telégram was sent from the Mamour of Abnoub to the Parguet
                        at Assiout saying that a woman's body had been found floating on the Nile
                        near Abnoab. Two hours later, another telegram arrived stating that the body
                        was bruised in many places and that the women must have been murdered before
                        her dead body was thrown into the river. The Mamour, added in this. telegram
                        that the Abnoub doctor was "absent and asked for the Assigut doctor to be
                        sent at once. </p>
                    <p>Accordingly the doctor, accompanied by the Substitut" of the Parquet, went to
                        Abnoub. But, on their arrival they found, to their great astonishment, that
                        the body had disappeared and there were no traces of it. </p>
                    <p>On being interrogated the Mamour accused the Moswen of ordering the ghaffits
                        to dispose of the body in the Nile, so that they might not bave an
                        additional crime in their markaz. l'he Monwen in his turn açoused the
                        Mamour. Enquiry is now being made, not about the murder case, but about the
                        responsibility of the Mamour and Molwen. The President of thre Parquet, the
                        Inspector of the Ministry of the 'Interior, and the Moudir attend the
                        enquiry. Whatever may be the result of their investigation; and whether it
                        be proved that the Mainour. or the Muawen is responsible, the Markaz, as a
                        whole, is the cause of an occur. rence which looks serious enough to come
                        under.dhe head of crime. So it is with policemen in the provinces. A crime
                        is hushed up that the list at the end of the month may appear small, and
                        sometimes &amp; policeman accuses an innocent person because the real
                        perpetrator is unknown. </p>
                    <p>The second caise I aun going to mention proves the last part of this
                        statement. In my last letter I mentioned the case of the man at Awlad el
                        Sheikh who murdered three men. When he was committed for trial, another was
                        charged with him, he being accused of murdering one and his companion of
                        murdering the other two: The murderer was an onéry. of the Omdoh and the
                        other was a friend of the criminal. The Court after two days' examination
                        found out that he was mnocent, and accordiogly condemned the Omdeh and his
                        mun to six mouths' imprisoniment with hard labour for bearing false witness. </p>
                    <p>Such is the the management of criminal cases here. The difficulty lies ju the
                        faot that the police official, froin the ghaffirs at the bottom up to
                        nalours at the top, are "responsible" for finding the author- of every
                        crime. They are lifble to a penalty in cases where they cannot find out a
                        criminal. A natural result of this organisation, a by no means small number
                        of innocent people are committed, for trial every day. The results
                        frequently are, firstly, the real criminal escapes punishment and secondly,
                        an innocent person is gondemued. The guilty man finding himself victorious,
                        as he has carried out his criminal intention without being -punished for it,
                        is ensouraged to commit more primes. The second, in his turn, finding that
                        he was unjustly condemned because of false witnasa given against him by
                        omdehş and ghaflirs, makes it his first object on leaving prison to revengo
                        himself, and again more crimes are committed. </p>
                    <p>Although illustrationg of my statements oocur_ every day, yet the. Mitsistry
                        of the Interior sticke obstinately to its regulations. I-am informed by the
                        local officials here that the Ministry is continually urged by the
                        inspectors to change this vicious system but all to ng effect. I have
                        therefore sent this plain statement of fact 'to, the "Gazette" in order that
                        the supreme authoritió may be made aware of the state of things and change
                        the present system. </p>

                    <p>It is a melancholy reflection that while ng land's political influencé in:
                        Egypt is becoming paramount our imports into the country fail to keep up
                        even a norms, rate of progress, and are growing staller by degrees every
                        year. The returns for 1904, which have just been issued by the Customs
                        Administration, afford little cause for congratulation. During last year the
                        imports into Egypt adyanced by nearly four millions sterling, but the
                        percentage of the United Kingdom in the total import trade of Egypt is
                        slowly but steadily declining and now stands at 8A, as against 35.3 in 1903
                        and 37.5 in 1902. This logs of trade to the extent of 31 per cent in two
                        years represents something considerably over half a million sterling. In
                        1899 and 1900 our proportion was 38.6 and we have to go as far béck as 1896
                        to touch &amp; lower proportion than we did last year, when Great Britain's
                        proportion of imports fell to 32.2, although in 1894. and 1895, the two
                        previous years, it had been as high ag 85.6 and 38. The Castoms returns for
                        1904 and 1903 give the proportional part of imports contributed by each
                        nation per mille for each category of goods and we will keep to this system
                        in the following comparison. </p>
                    <p>. 1. Last year England's exports of coal here were | 129,against 146 in 1903,
                        worked iron and steel importa fell from 84 to 72, cotton thread from 27 to
                        23, carriages (wagons) from 12 to 10, mood for building, eto., from 10 to 6,
                        haberdashery and ironmongery from 9 to 8, and miscellaneous imports. from
                        174 to 164. The increases OVERY the previgps year are as follows: cotton
                        textures, from 361 to 378, machinery, from 65 to 76, mixed textures, from 46
                        to 54, copper and. brass, from 84 to 38, woollen and linen yarn, from 18 to
                        20. Manufactured linen goods remained the same. </p>
                    <p>Our rivals in the Egyptian import trade, Belgium, Italy, and Germany, all
                        show a con; siderable advance in 1904 over their share of imports in 1903:
                        Taking 1,000 as the total import from all countries, Germany's imports rose
                        from 44 to 55, Belgium's from 31 to 36, and Italy's from 53 to 67. . </p>
                    <p>"The attention of the President of the Board of Trade was recently drawn to
                        the persistent shrinkage of British imports to Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The official reply was that the fluctuations il the figures from year to year
                        "arise, to a large extent, from the variations in the price of coal, the
                        imports, of which are derived almost entirely from the Upited Kingdom. If
                        coal be excluded, the figures will appear as follow </p>
                    <p>1895, 28.1 per cent ; 1896, 28.0 per cent.; 1897, 30.8 per cent.; 1898,281.4

                        death of the Kaffir Circus. . The market is out of touch with everybody,
                        having disgusted the public with its inanition, put itself into opeia

                        negligible, the Indian mines are not "everybody's money," while the less

                        only have themselves to blape. Spécolatora must also remember that even
                        under the most favorable conditions the profitableness of mining in Egypt

                        seen. Sobilizzi, the 1902 champion, will not compete, and Matheson, who put
                        up such a good fight in the pole jump last year, has left the country. His
                        venerable, opponent, however, is with ns still, and though suffering from a
                        football injury, is practising. We hear the B.T.C. ataff have got odt some

                        Carey, who was iu charge. The income and expenditure account was most
                        moderate, and, ho did not think, required comment. With regard to Block
                        'T.'." when the rirat expedition was sent to this property they sank eight
                        small shafts with a view to locating the reef, but Jound indications at the
                        northern part of the block the more . favorable, and os the capital at their
                        disposal was limited they concentrated the work upon this particular shaft,
                        the results of which were so clearly shown iu the reports of Mr. Norway, and
                        which had been endorsed by the engineers, Messrs. Lake and Currie. The total
                        footage was 1,083 ft. in drives and sinking. They would ob­serve by the plus
                        accompanying the report that they were now driving both north and £9util at
                        the 100 ft. level j also that as they had previewed in depth the reef which
                        they discovered had been improving in value. It was new established that the
                        reef ou Biock "JS" w.is the same fissure as that existing at the Um Garaitut
                        mine, consequently no doubt Would exist in the minds of engineers or others
                        w to the continuity of the reel and its values. He was continued in this by
                        a clause in Mr. Newbury's report—an do rood by Messrs. Luke and Currie— in
                        which ho said that the strike, dip and general appearance at the Lode led to
                        the belief that they wero ou the same fissure as the Nile Valloy Company at

                        for­ward with-all the energy possible. By the courtesy of the Hilo Volley
                        Company they had nada arrangements for irial curbing with the mill of three
                        stamps, which would no utilised in ascertaining alues. They bad also marie
                        an application to that company fur the use of their heavy stamps for bulk
                        samples, and he had no doubt this would be arranged. They hud some 1W tons
                        which they could commence to crash. Hu could not, say how hopeful they were
                        in to. the ultimate value of this mine,: which they wore anxious should bo
                        among the. pioneer mines of Egypt. (Applause.) He read , letter from Mr. It,
                        J. Price, the chairman ol the Nile Valloy Company, who recently visited tho
                        mine, in which ho said he was delighted to Bay that trewsi very much pleased

                        to show visible gold. He had a high opinion ol tho prospects of the company,
                        and congratulated them upon their staff at the mine.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Dongola Concession, Mr. Carey was dispatched to the
                        concession to locate old workiugs. Tho area was very largo, but in the tint
                        season's work be not only- located several old workings and mode a
                        geo­logical survey of the concession, but also examined the southern part
                        and sunk several small pita or shafts to see if he coaid discover any
                        well-defined coal measures. Diamond drilling was now in progress to try to
                        find a workable seam of coal If one was struck the value would be enormous,
                        and ho believed that their chances wero more than even of doing ho. To
                        confirm this he consulted with Mr. Mills, an eminent coal expert, wlm bad
                        written him &amp; letter, in which ho expressed the belief that coat would
                        be found. (Applause.) This conces­sion wak, .! course, an immensely valuable
                        asset to Block "E,'' and contained great pos­sibilities- Any of the old
                        workings in the north might prove of sufficient value to form hsidiaries;
                        and again in the south, if they ok a workable seam of coal, it would neces-
                        e the formation of a large company. The u-Government hod authorised the
                        capita- jn of a syndicate to more thoroughly .re and develop this
                        concession, with -apital of £100,000, £50,000 of which i-Ji was to he
                        working capital. A financial •tip in London was dosirioue of taking up is
                        concession, and it wae a question with the uirectors whether it would bo
                        better to offer at to the shaicliuldera or complete negotiations with this
                        group. A survey had also been made of the agricultural land bordering tho
                        Nile, in consequence of which an application was made for a-grant of *0,000
                        acres, The Government . had informed them by cable that they were - willing
                        to grant 25,000 acres, and the remaining 15,000 acres was atiEI under
                        consideration. The Sudan Govermeut were not disponed to grant agricultural
                        land to mining companies; hut, recognising the work the company had done!
                        they had made ihe grant on condition that it should be undertaken by a
                        separate company, 'ihe idea was that there should be a large company, with a
                        capital of £400,000 and a working capital of £250,000, and the directors
                        were in negotiation with a strong group,with a view to taking this up.
                        (Hear, boar.) In con­clusion be thought the facts he had given showed that
                        the Block "K" a»sois must ultimately be of very great value. He mow! the

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. They are as
                        follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman

                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE II. NORTHERN ITALY. Italian Lakes Italian &amp; French
                        Riviera</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
