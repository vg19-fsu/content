                    <head>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY.</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipality, as an international institution suitable for
                        such a city as this is, may be considered to be the best of the kind that
                        could be invented, for it combines all the essential drawbacks of a great
                        representative institution with none of its advantages. The municipal
                        councillors, who are elected on an extraordinarily limited and artificial
                        franchise, derive a great deal of importance from their self-allotted
                        duties. Most of them remain in Europe from the spring until late in the
                        autumn, and there is no obligation for them to attend to the ordinary
                        routine of their municipal functions. They enjoy an enormous privilege, for
                        they are quite free from public opinion, which is non-existent here, and
                        they rigorously prohibit the Press from being present at their meetings. The
                        reports of their assemblies are carefully edited and doctored before being
                        sent to the newspapers, and only rumours as to the real state of affairs
                        consequently leak out. With all its faults the Ministry of Public Works is
                        considered by business men to be far better to treat with than the
                        Municipality, and we have only to observe the progress which Cairo has made
                        within the last few years in order to form a comparison between the
                        efficiency of the two bodies. It is, however, ridiculous to complain of the
                        Alexandria Municipality, for in the nature of things it cannot be better, as
                        it is unreasonable to expect that a Municipality can be essentially better
                        than the city whose destinies it controls. Alexandria, in fact, does not
                        deserve a better institution, and if it bad more unselfish and
                        public-spirited members of the Municipality it would not know how to
                        appreciate them, but would so misinterpret their motives that they would be
                        forced to retire from public life in despair.</p>
                    <p>No better proof of the logic of our standpoint on this matter need be adduced
                        than to cite the proceedings at the recent discussions on the subject of
                        introducing fresh sources of taxation. At the penultimate meeting of the
                        Municipal Commission several propositions for fresh taxation were agreed to.
                        The most important of these was the impact on retail dealers of alcoholic
                        liquors, it being impossible to get at the wholesale dealers owing to the
                        commercial treaties. The week before last our Municipal Councillors, having

                        themselves by putting off the application of this tax until the Greek
                        Kalends. There was no genuine discussion of the reasons for the postponement
                        of this most useful tax, and the interests of a great city were cynically
                        flouted on behalf of a small class of retailers who happen to enjoy votes. |
                        There is no need to blame the Councillors. After all they only acted
                        according to their own lights, and having no other ideas than t) be secure
                        of their seats at the elections fifteen months hence they naturally obeyed
                        the orders of the drink-retailers, who otherwise would have voted solid
                        against them. They would thus have lost their seats and been in all
                        probability replaced by more unsatisfactory persons. It is therefore
                        ridiculous to criticise our Municipal Councillors as we notice with regret
                        that our local contemporary La Réforme has in a recent issue. Our excellent
                        confrere, in its leading article, said : </p>
                    <p>Qu'on s'y prenne, d'ailleurs, comme on voudra, il n'est pas possible que l'on
                        ne finisse pas par s'émouvoir en ville de la situation actuelle. Les
                        questions municipales nous touchent dans nos intérêts immédiats, et lorsque
                        l'on verra qu'il n'y a pas à attendre de nos conseillers des décisions,
                        suivies d'une exécu. tion rapide, il se produira un mouvement tel que
                        l'institution, elle-même, en sera atteinte dans son essence, car
                        l'impuissance pour l'ac. tion sera la condamnation du régime international </p>
                    <p>Quand donc pourrons-nous écrire après une séance : la Municipalité a décidé
                        ceci ou cela et les travaux vont commencer dans quelques jours ! </p>
                    <p>Il n'est plus permis d'accuser l'administration ; celle-ci attend l'impulsion
                        du corps délibérant et doit être prête à la suivre. </p>
                    <p>Si on ne fait rien, c'est que les conseillers municipaux ne le veulent pas,
                        voilà ce que l'on sera bientôt en droit de proclamer. </p>
                    <p>In our humble opinion all such criticism is beside the mark. Neither the
                        Municipality nor its councillors can be more efficient than they are now, as
                        they must ipso facto be on a level with the city, and on the whole they are
                        quite as good as anything that Alexandria deserves. </p>

                    <head>CRUELTY TO ANIMALS. </head>
                    <p>There is a very serious discrepancy between the way in which the Mixed
                        Tribunals and the Native Court at Cairo regard cases of cruelty to animals.
                        This discrepancy is so startling that it deserves publicity, for it is a
                        scandal that there should be such a divergence between the points of view of
                        two different judicial systems working in the same city. From January 1 to
                        the 12th inst. the Mixed Courts in the Capital had 23 cases brought before
                        them of Europeans working old, wounded, and emaciated animals ; there were
                        four acquittals and nineteen fines of P.T. 5. But the Native Courts inflict
                        fines of P.T. 100 and P.T. 50 in such cases. Why there should be this
                        differ. ence we do not know, but it is sincerely to be hoped that the Mixed
                        Tribunals will follow the example of the Native Courts, and be in future
                        more severe. Even the latter are by no means as strict as they ought to be,
                        and there is a startling difference between the convictions in Cairo for
                        gross cases of cruelty and those in England. A man at home that works a
                        starved horse covered with whip marks would get a fine of £5 or a month's
                        imprisonment. Here, however, a fine of P.T. 5 or P.T. 10 is all that judges
                        think Europeans ought to pay. As the Courts persist in such a flagrantly
                        lenient policy, it is not worth while for the police to bother themselves to
                        bring the charges only to be made ridiculous by such nonsensical sentences.
                        When an Anglo-Egyptian veterinary surgeon officially states that "the animal
                        is starved, the wounds are old, and it is a gross case of cruelty," it would
                        be enough, we should think, to ensure the offender being fined P.T. 100 at
                        least. The Mixed Courts at Cairo do not appear to think so, and such an
                        attitude is most discouraging to the police, so that the sooner a more
                        draconian view is adopted the better. How can the Society for the Prevention
                        of Cruelty to Animals, which is doing splendid work at Cairo, be encouraged
                        when the law courts are so lenient ! Yet there is plenty of scope for it in
                        Cairo. It is by no means an uncommon spectacle to see private carriage
                        horses with pieces of skin torn off their flanks' by the hamess. Many of the
                        cab horses are overworked ånd underfed in spite of the rise of tariff some
                        months age. The worst cases of cruelty that can be seen in Cain occur where
                        building operations and taking place. There overloading is almost habitual,
                        and many horses have broken knees caused in starting or getting the carts
                        close up to the buildings to unload. Tourists, instea i of doing harm to the
                        natives by the indiscriminate scattering of backsheesh. might economise in
                        that direction and contribute to the Cairo S.P.C.A.</p>

                    <p>Whatever may have been done in other parts of Egypt for the wvlfare and
                        happiness ot our guests during the 'X-na* holidays Helouan can at least take
                        credit to itself for having provided most seasonable enjoyments for its
                        visitors. Ths Grand Hote', besides providing a firstolaas dinner in all
                        respects, commencing with turtle soup and finishing with good old English
                        plum padding, had also a farther treat in store. One end of the large dining
                        ball was illuminated by a beautiful 'Xmas Tree tastefully decorated and
                        lighted with electric lamps of different colours. At the close of the dinner
                        Dr. Hobson announced that the management had provided a further
                        entertainment in the form of a tombola, or Italian lottery. Each guest bad a
                        card given him containing certain numbers. Ths<hi rend="underline"
                        >ma</hi>itre d'hfltel "Joseph then called out the numbers from the tombola.
                        As soon as the possessor of a card had a complete row of five numbers as
                        called out he then had the tight to select a prise from a table covered with
                        a collsctioo of beautiful presents all nicely conooalsd in appropriate
                        wrappers. As there were over 100 priiM every guest had the privilege of
                        present­ing a winning card and making his selection accordingly.</p>
                    <p>The collection of prizes was so numerous that space forbids our describing
                        them all, but we must congratulate Mr. Manuel on receiving a most beautiful
                        ladies' embroidered bolero. Lady Gilbert Parker was the early recipient of a
                        beautiful prize. Rev, Campbell and Mr Fildes vied with one another in their
                        race to be early at the tables, both receiving das rewards. Mrs Seligman and
                        party were very successful in their drawings. The members sf Countess
                        Karolyi's family constantly appeared to be very del ghted with the amusement
                        and were received with cheers whilst going to re caive their prizes.
                        Altogether a most enjoyable evening was passed We bear that a grand ball
                        will take place on the last day of the year, to see the new year in and the
                        old year out.</p>

                    <p>ST MARK'S, ALEXANDRIA</p>
                    <p>The services on Christmas Day were largely attended, the numbers at the 7 30
                        a m. service being nearly double that of last year. At the 11am. service
                        every seat wax occupied, including about 60 chairs which were placed in the
                        aisle and at the west end ot the church. The choir sang the "Te Deum" to a
                        setting by Rev E Vine Hall. The anthem was "Behold, I bring," by the same
                        composer. Two offertory sentences were song and the first part of the
                        service closed with the National Anthem. The Communion service was a simple
                        setting by the Rev. F A. Gore Ouseley, though the time was by oo msans easy.
                        The singing of the music was excellent, and did the choir credit. The two
                        soprano solos in the anthem taken by Miss Callender, and the playing of the
                        organ by Mr Heaton, were specially worthy of note.</p>
                    <p>The church and chapel were tastefully decor ated. Among those who sent
                        offerings of flowers were Mrs. Batobeller, Mrs. Callender, Mire Coates, Mr

                        responsible for decorating the church were Mesdamrs Eyre, Roberts, and
                        Algernon Ward, Misses Barwell, Dodd, Morrison, and Talbot, and Mr
                        Heaton.</p>
                    <p>The collections throughout the day were for the fond for the poor and

                    <p>( PROM UUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. ) </p>
                    <p>Loxor, Dec. 25. There are no occasions more likely to oppress 08 with a
                        painful sense of our shortcominge and want of knowledge than our first
                        visits to the wonderful and awe striking temples round about Laxor. Vainly
                        do we con our guide books and read long accounts of the insoriptions that
                        tell their bistory, and endeavour to commit to memory long stringe of
                        dimensions that ought to, but don't convey some inkliog of their grandeur.
                        No sooner bave we passed bevesth those heavy pylons and found ooreelves like
                        pigmies at the feet of stalwart statoes and mighty pillars than all
                        recollections of our former stadies fly from our minds; and nothing is left
                        but the wonder that goch things should be, and that we also should be
                        allowed to be in such close proximity to them. If only the elements of
                        Egyptology could be taught us in our youth, perbaps we might in time become
                        reasonably familiar with the history of the great gods and rulers of Egypt,
                        ond might follow the telling of their deeds with some degree of
                        intelligence. Instead of which we stand amszd at the immensity of the
                        subject, our minds bent to the sigoificance of it, and our feat from
                        stumbling over the pitfalls of our ignorance. </p>
                    <p>I have often wondered why some enterprising person has not instituted a
                        series of lectures to be delivered on the very soones of interest in the
                        neighbourhood. Would some of the well koown professors on the subject
                        condescend to take them each in turn and explain them on their very sites, I
                        take it that a vast number of people would be only too gratified to avail
                        themselves of tbe oppor tonity to garder the fruits of their learning;
                        wbereas now it is impossible to accept or remember a tithe ot the garbled
                        information which the ordinary dragoman is pleased to impart. Lactares at
                        home or even in Cairo are all well enough in their way, but they would gain
                        considerably in value and popularity could they only be delivered on the
                        spot. A series which might be given daring ton days or a fortnight, and
                        which would ombrace the temples of Luxor and Karnak on one side of the
                        river, and that long series of marvellous tombs and coloasi and Theban
                        remsing on the other, would tempt many people to continue in the
                        neighbourhood, and would bring still more notoriety to the researches of the
                        exploration companies. </p>

                    <byline>(From our Thxatrical Cdrrupundbnt.)</byline>
                    <p>1 came in rather late in the 2nd act, after hearing the singing at
                        Sbepheard's and I wish ed I had s'ayed at Shenheard's. "Carmen" was really
                        just about as bad as it could be. The only relieviag feature* were Ml'e
                        Devilloy and M Fontaine. M. Fontaine, for once, seemed to have freed his
                        voice: it was clear and resonant, and without effort in the lower register.
                        Id fact, all his usual faults were, for onee, absent. Mlle Devilloy was
                        delightful, co sweet and true, and with such a charm in every note, that she
                        was encored, and we all wished Mioae'a were a big part instead of being only
                        secondary M&amp;ry as E*oamillo seemed to me very apathetic , I was told the
                        Toreador song was not by any mean* wonder fol. Mme Chaix Bonheur, of whom 1
                        had heard so much, was most disappointing, and far too melodramatic; her
                        voice wasn't pleasing at all: it was too coarse and masculine, as was indeed
                        the whole of her interpretation. The rest of the singers and the orcheatra
                        were al! at sixes and leven*. quite tuneless, out of time, often actually
                        singing false. The orchestra was just possible when by itself, but the
                        moment any singing began everything went wrong. I quite agree with "
                        L'Egypte'a " proposal to change them radically and entirely They evidently
                        have no spontaneity or responsivene**, and they play badly, and no amount of
                        bard work will improve them The result is that only the fdw good singers oan
                        do anything, and that by forcing them selves and rest on to the right note,
                        or com promising on the wrong note. The others and 'he chorus have no chance
                        against such discordant apathy</p>

                    <p>To one who bad seen "Carmen' at Cairo last Monday night, any performance of
                        any opera might well have aeemed excellent. Buch was our case ; but even
                        after discounting this artificial autbesissm ore must admit that there were
                        roally few faults in last night's "Bohfcme ;" there were email, but
                        annoying. In the first place, the one performer whose voice should never be
                        beard at all, the con­ductor, to wit, talked much too loud and much too long
                        , over tbs roller an.I in the noisier passages h s rounded tones were au
                        dible throughout the house, now challeng­ing his orches'ra to further
                        effort*, now al laying their superfluous z*al. When the prompter sl*o gave
                        tongue, deep answering to deep, our last particle ot dramatu illusion wm
                        lost. Then the horrible encore bsbit reasserted I'self. On this evil it is
                        nnneoes sary to dilate we can even pardon it in the case of B. Carlo's '
                        Veochia zimavra, senti," a triumph t>f i-ympathetic phrasing. Finally, wo
                        would like to point out to the zealous gentleman who managed the enow that,

                    <p>The large increase in the exports for 1906 is, of course, dae to the abundant
                        cotton crop and the high prices ruling. The upward move- ment in the imports
                        is hardly less remarkable, raising their value as it does to a figure which
                        is some 10% higher than that of 1905. This notable progress appears by the
                        customs returns to be shared by nearly all classes of the import trade, the
                        most prominent advance being in the category of metal and machinery, which
                        alone accounts for 40% of the total increase.</p>
                    <p>In my Note last year I said: "The fact that during the past two years the
                        imports of mer- chandise and specie taken together have greatly outbalanced
                        the exports, notwithstanding the constant heavy charges for the service of
                        the foreign debt, constitutes a phenomenon that calls for reflection. A
                        readjustment in the direction of normal equilibriam must come sooner or
                        later, and, if we are paying for our imports with capital provided by the
                        foreign investor, the operation, though by no means unsound at present,
                        cannot be indefinitely continued." These remarks were somewhat severely
                        criticised by a portion of the local Press, which was inclined to accuse me
                        of economic heresy and pessimistic fore- bodings. In the passage quoted
                        above I was far from desiring to formulate any economic theory, heretical or
                        otherwise, but the fact that the total imports of merchandise and specie in
                        1900 amounted to LE. 18,200,000 as against L.B. 21,600,000 for exports,
                        leaving a balance of LE. 3,400,000 in favour of exports, while in 1906 the
                        figures are, imports LE 31,900,000 and experts LE 28,500,000, showing a
                        balance of over LB. 3,400,000 in favour of imports, is a phenomenon worthy
                        of attention and study. Even if these figures imply that Egypt has been
                        paying for her imports with funds advanced by the foreign capitalist, there
                        is nothing necessarily alarming in the fact, so long as the capital in ques-
                        tion is employed for the purpose of remanera. tive enterprise.</p>
                    <p>A special feature in the budget of last year was the reduction of the import
                        daty on certain articles of first necessity from 8% to 4% ad valorem.
                        Unfortunately, the condi- tions which have prevailed during the past year
                        are not such as to furnish a fair basis on which to form a definite opinion
                        as to the precise effect of this redaction. In the first place, there were
                        considerable accumulations of stocks to be disposed of before the consumers
                        could expect to benefit by the reduction, and secondly, foreign market
                        prices and freights for most of the articles were higher this year. <floatingText>

                    <p>Judging, however, from the data before me. I am inclined to think that,

                        on articles of first necessity will not be found, for the moment, to have
                        affected the consumption to any very great extent, whatever the final
                        results may be. If this view proves to be correct, it may, at all events, be
                        claimed for the messure taken last year that, while it benefits the
                        consumers, it also furnishes the Government with a fiscal reserve which
                        could be made use of in case of emergency with the least possible disturbing
                        effect upon trade.</p>

                    <p>COTTON.</p>
                    <p>Although the area devoted to cotton has steadily increased of late years, the
                        total amount of the crop has scarcely varied, and it was feared that
                        over-cropping had seriously impaired the productivity of the soil.</p>
                    <p>The record of this year does not altogether bear out this theory. The present
                        cotton season has proved very satisfactory. The total crop will probably
                        exceed that of its prede- cessor by from one-half to three-quarters of a
                        million kantars.</p>
                    <p>The superiority has been very marked in Upper Egypt, where in the season of
                        1995 the crop was disastrous. In spite of a considerable dimination of area
                        in this region, the total crop of this year will exceed that of last year.
                        In quality also it is superior.</p>
                    <p>Climatic conditions generally over the whole country ware favourable, and the
                        water supply plentiful. Somewhat cool weather late in September and early in
                        October caused some anxie'y, but a hot spell improved matters a: d the later
                        crop proved satisfactory. The feature of the season has been the high prices
                        ruling. The season opened auspiciously in this respect, and towards the end
                        of the year prices reached an extremely high figure, especially for Joan-
                        novich. This fact, together with the increased yield, has meant a gain to
                        the country of some five or six millions sterling in ex0388 of the profit of
                        last year. In spite of high prices trade demands in England, the Continent
                        and America have been good. Demands in the fine yarn trade have been
                        excellent.</p>
                    <p>As regards the quality of this year's crop, the middle qualities have proved
                        superior to last year, though there have been complaints that the finer
                        qualities leave something to be desired.</p>
                    <p>With an extension in the cultivation of Egyptian cottons in other parts of
                        the world, it cannot be too strongly impressed that, if our cottons are to
                        hold their supremacy in the market quality most receive very careful <cb
                            n="4"/> attention. With an increased demand for those high class goods
                        for which Egyptian cotton are extensively employed, there must naturally e
                        be a growing demand for high grade cottons. In this connection the question
                        of seed selec tion is one which requires every consideration and
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>The out-turn in ginuing in the early part of the sesson was not satisfactory,
                        and, though better results were obtained later in the year, yet the result
                        is bat moderate.</p>
                    <p>The past season has been fortunate in respect to insect attacks. The
                        cotton-worm did prac tically no harm, while the destructive boll worm
                        appeared much later in the season and in mach diminished numbers.</p>

                    <p>GOLD DEMAND OF THE EGYPTIAN MARKET.</p>
                    <p>It may not be out of place here to offer some remarks on recent imports of
                        specie to Egypt which have attracted some attention in the financial
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Gold coin is invariably imposted in considerable quantity in the autumn in
                        order to move the cotton crop, the amount required depending on the value of
                        the crop (quantity X price), the rapidity with which it is brought to
                        market, and the reserves already existing in the hands of the banks. The
                        first of these is usually the predominating faotor. In the present instance,
                        the exceptionally large volume of the crop and the high prices it commanded,
                        coupled with the fact that the cultivators took the opportunity of selling
                        their cotton earlier than usual, brought it about that the demand tor gold
                        made itself felt with great suddenness at the beginning of October. The
                        reserves in the Banks were quickly exhausted, and a temporary financial
                        stringency ensued, which was ultimately alleviated by the arrival of gold
                        from Europe.</p>
                    <p>The demand for gold in large quantities for Egypt, constituting as it does a
                        phenomenon of annual occurrence, would probably have passed without comment
                        had it not fallen, concentrated and sudden, upon a marke already short of
                        supplies. The withdrawal of some four millions from the London money market
                        for Egypt during the month of October was doubtless the principal cause of
                        the advance of the Bank of England rate to 6% It may be observed here that
                        no rise in the rate of interest will arrest a drain of gold to move the
                        Egyptian cotton crop, for, owing to the reluctance of the native cultivator
                        to accept anything but actual coin in payment of hi cotton, a permanent
                        check to the supplies would stop the entire commerce of the country and lead
                        to the most serious consequc. In view of the apprehensions which have found
                        expression in some quarters, it is the more necessary to lay emphasis on the
                        fact that the recent demand for gold was a purely trade demand, and was in
                        no way connected with the financing of speculative operations. Although it
                        is incontestable, as I had occasion to point out in my last Note, that such
                        opera- tions have been fostered to a considerable extent of recent years
                        with the help of foreign capital, they should not be confounded with the
                        normal and legitimate commerce of the country. It is, indeed, gratifying to
                        learn, on the authority of the British Chamber of Com merce, that
                        "speculation in stocks and lands was reduced to its lowest limit during the
                        past few months" (British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt Monthly Journal,
                        November, 1906, artiole on "The Financial Stringency in Egypt").</p>
                    <p>EGYPTIAN COMPANIES.</p>
                    <p>It my last Budget Note, I drew attention to the fact that the incorporation
                        of an Egyptian Company by Khedivial Decree only implies that the Company in
                        question has conformed to certain roles and regulations; it does not imply
                        that it enjoys the support, or even the approval, of the Khedivial
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The system is an antiquated one modelled, I believe, on an old French law
                        long since repealed.</p>
                    <p>It is the custom of the Khedivial Govern- ment to authorise all companies
                        which conform with the letter of the regulations. Last spring, however, it
                        was brought to the notice of the Ministry of Finance that the creation of
                        "Founders' shares" was being carried to an abusive extent, and, on the
                        advice of the Legal Advisors to Government, it was decided by the Connell of
                        Ministers on June 2 to limit the creation of such shares to cases in which
                        they represent property in an invention, or a Government concession of which
                        the value is problematical.</p>
                    <p>In foreign countries the regulations laid down are often less stringent than
                        those which obtain in Egypt. The result has been that companies whose
                        incorporation in Egypt wa refused have been successfully floated elsewhere
                        This has notably happened in the case of ope Company which with a capital of
                        L E. 100,000 in 25,000 LB 4 shares proposed to issue 100,000 Founders'
                        shares. It has, I understand, been registered as a British company. </p>
                    <p>REDUCTION OF TAXATION.</p>
                    <p>Of late years it seems to have been expected almost as a matter of course
                        that, as December came round, some remission of texation in the succeeding
                        year would ba announced. The limits within which snob remissions are
                        possible has, except as regards the reform of the Customs tariff, now almost
                        been reached. Had the conditions of the past year been normal, the
                        Government would cer-<cb n="5"/> tainly have considered the advisability of
                        taking a further step in tariff reform. Under the unfortunate conditions
                        which marked the early part of the year, and in view of the possible
                        recrudescence of similar difficulties in the future, accompanied by a
                        corresponding increase in the demands on the national parse, it has been
                        deemed advisable to take no measures calculated to diminish the financial
                        resources of the administration.</p>
                    <p>In deference, however, to the wishes expressed last year by the Legislative
                        Council, a small reform has been adopted by the abolition of the Ayloola
                        dues hitherto levied by the Ministry of Finance. When land is sold by beirs
                        who have not previously accomplished the formality of proving their title by
                        means of a deed in the regular form, it is customary for the Madiriebe to
                        claim payment of the Ayloola daes before transferring the property to the
                        name of the purchaser in the Land tax Registers. In such cases, the dues
                        will not be demanded in fatare, but they will continue to be levied in the
                        Mehkemehs when a title is applied for and a Hodget Ayloola is delivered to
                        prove the same. The loss to the Treasury is estimated at LB 18,0 0.</p>

                        <p>Sir,-In view of the secular strife that is ever being waged between the
                            local and London boards of Egyptian companies I have a most valuable
                            suggestion to make, which I am sare would be most useful. A large amount
                            of friction might be avoided if company pro- moters in Egypt, when
                            soliciting British capital for their enterprise, were to state that
                            after allotment the services of London boards of directors would be
                            dispensed with.-I am, etc., </p>

                            absolutely untrue, as the story I told was a plain and unvarnished

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE Sir,-In reference to the
                            correspondence which has appeared on this subject, permit me to say that
                            what may have appeared a heavy punish ment is not as severe as the
                            writer himself would like to give such people. It must be remembered
                            that a number of people who unfortunately call themselves British
                            subjects behave in such a manner that strong messures must be adopted in
                            the attempt to suppress these disgraceful outbreaks of rowdyism among t
                            Britishers abroad. Such men as the one in question, what may be termed
                            the "ball dog style," are evidently under the impression that they can
                            do and aot just as they think fit, and from persons! knowledge I
                            congratulate our worthy Consul General on his efforts to bring sach
                            anraly characters to their proper senses. I trust that last example will
                            prove a warning to others. I am, eto, </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Sir,-Fêting 'Xmas is natural and indeed proper. But is it necessary for
                            certain soldiers of the Army of Occupation to display the results of too
                            much good cheer quite as publicly? Two nights ago I observed an
                            excellent man gloriously intoxicated asking a puzzled shawish the way to
                            the Ezbekieh within 50 yard of Shepheard's. A group of Egyptians watched
                            derisively till the soldier titubated over one of the Tanzim's obstacle
                            tracks towards the Bristol Hotel On the same evening several other
                            sights of the sort might have been seen. I am glad to admit that there
                            is a great improvement in our Army in the matter of temperance, but
                            something remains to be done, and in a country like this the spectacle
                            of a drunken soldier does not improve our prestige among Moslems.-I am,

                    <p>THE IMPORTS IN OCTOBER.</p>
                    <p>(From the Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce).</p>
                    <p>The steady rise in the monthly clearances recorded daring August and
                        September was quite left in the shade by the returns for October, when the
                        total imports amounted to LB. 2-721,461, being an increase of L. E. 216,911
                        over the same period in 1905. The total gain for the current year from the
                        1st January to the end of October was nearly L.B. 2,000,000, the actual
                        figure; being L.E. 19,180,097, against L.E. 17,221,409.</p>
                    <p>CEREALS.</p>
                    <p>Although the enormous increases in the cereal classification have somewhat
                        abated during recent monthe-mainly due to exceedingly heavy shipments for
                        the same periods in 1905 -the division showed an expansion of over L.B.
                        25,000 for October. Flour was L.B. 31,106 up, though this was nullified by a
                        drop of L.B. 32,220 in the maize figures. The deliveries from Burmah, valued
                        at L.B. 54,650, were some LE 16,000 above last year's olearance, whilst the
                        miscellaneous cereals contributed an increase of L.E. 13,668.</p>
                    <p>CHEMICAL PRODUCTS.</p>
                    <p>The returns for medical preparations and chemical manures were L.E. 41.715,
                        or an increase of L.B. 14,918. Artificial manures were received from America
                        to the extent of L.E. 27,859.</p>
                    <p>COLONIAL PRODUCE</p>
                    <p>-</p>
                    <p>COFFEE. Out of the 876,281 kilos of ooffse valued at LB. 33,163 which reached
                        Egypt daring October, America was credited with LB. 80,032 and, farkey L.E.
                        2,373. The rise over the whole was L. B. 8,665.</p>
                    <p>SUGAR. Whereas Russia, Roumania, and Austria all made heavy shipments of
                        augar twelve months ago, the two former countries dropped out of the trade
                        in October, whilst Austria only for warded L E. 2,715 against ber previous
                        figures of LE. 19,000. Germany increased her hold on this market with con-
                        signments worth LE 2,864.</p>
                    <p>METALS.</p>
                    <p>The total returns in this category at L.E 466,853 were more than double those
                        of September, whilst the increase compared with 1906 was one of LE. 101,968.
                        Great Britain contributed L.B. 194,957, Germany L.B.52,318, France L.E.
                        13,119, and Belgium over LE 117,000.</p>
                    <p>IRON &amp; IRONWORK. Girders and other beavy forms of iron work to the extent
                        of 18,194 tons (LE. 107,843) were passed through the Customs during October.
                        The remainder of the clearances ander the classification were valued at LE.
                        125,032. Compared with last year the expansion on the division was LE
                        87,069.</p>
                    <p>MACHINERY-GENERAL.</p>
                    <p>Shipments to the extent of LE. 126,532 were received, the greater part coming
                        from England. France did L.B. 16,872, Austria L.B. 7,533, and Germany L.B.
                        4,465. The increase was L.B. 74,791 over October 1905.</p>
                    <p>LOCOMOTIVES. The drop of L.E. 39,790 in locomotives does not call for any
                        comment) except to note that the whole of this amount wae debited to Great
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>BOLLING STOCK The home country did not contribute to the rolling stock
                        deliveries during the month, this fact accounting for the decrease of LE.
                        34,032 ander the section Belgium completed orders to the extent of L.B.
                        29.350, whilst Spain was credited with L.B. 1,192.</p>
                    <p>TEXTILES.</p>
                    <p>The imports under this heading totalled little over three quarters of a
                        million pounds of which England had L.E. 419,594, Austria L.E. 85,2 5,
                        France LE 67,926, Italy L.E 45,357 and Germany L.E. 37,706. The ing arease
                        over last year's figures was L. B. 74,475 MANCHESTER GOODS. - The clearances
                        amounted to L.E. 361,361 against L.E 283,780 during the previous October.
                        Compared with the first ten months of 1905 the additional imports of
                        Manchester goods this year was LB. 77,581, which figures we imagine will be
                        considerably increased by the 31st December, The clearances by weight for
                        the month were 2,799,178 kilogrammes, and by measure 1,674,219. metres.</p>
                    <p>WOOLLEN GOODS-In woollen goods, 481,313 metres (LB. 61.185) were received
                        during October, against 491.932 metres (L.B. 63,319) last year England, of
                        course, led the way with -LE. 31,840, followed by Austria (L.E. 12 68).
                        France (L E. 10,095), and Germany (L.E 6,129). As a matter of possible
                        interest we may just mention that during the current year the above
                        countries shipped woollen goods to Egypt to the extent of 89,644 metres,
                        391,645 metres, 591,013 metres and 240,514 metres respectively.</p>
                    <p>SACKS. Practically the whole of the sack shipments were made from ludis,
                        Great Britain being only credited with LB. 65 The weight of the goods
                        amounted to 1,338 830 kilos valued at L.B. 31,124, against 1,788,498 (L.B.
                        40,044) twelve months ago.</p>
                    <p>WINES AND SPIRITS. The movements in the various sub divisions</p>
                    <p>of this category were insignificant, with the exception of petroleum, which
                        showed a shrink- age of LE. 54,793.</p>
                    <p>BEER.-The quantity cleared during October was 13,151 barrels, and 17,283
                        dozen bottles. These figures compare with 10.828 barrels and 14 470 dozen
                        bottles in 1905.</p>
                    <p>SPIRITS AND LIQUEURS. The clearances by weight were 73,140 kilograms, in
                        addition to 12,080 dozen bottles. Last year for the same</p>
                    <p>month the returns ware 101,680 kilos. and 13,684 dezin bottles.
                        PETROLEUM-With the exception of LE 68 from Russia, America was the only
                        country <cb n="2"/> landing petroleum in Egypt during October. The number of
                        cases cleared was 74,987.</p>
                    <p>TIMBER AND COAL</p>
                    <p>Each item in this division showed an increase, the total expansion amounting
                        to LE. 74,852. TIMBER-The total imports were valued at L.E. 144,231, or a
                        gain of L.E. 40,421. Sweden shipped L.E. 71,727, Turkey LE 27,766, Austria
                        20,191, and Roumania L.E. 12,082.</p>
                    <p>COAL.-171,283 tons valued L E. 127,969 were received, against 150,673 tons
                        (LE. 116.042) last year.</p>
                    <p>FURNITURE-Castom dues on the substan- tial sam of L.E. 49,518 for furniture,
                        etc., were paid daring October, the returns being L.B. 16,799 to the
                        good.</p>
                    <p>BUILDING MATERIALS, ETC.-This classifica- tion was again to the fore with an
                        increase of L. E. 22,785. The marble and stone figures- principally from
                        Italy-were 6,352, whilst lime, plaster and</p>
                    <p>higher by L.E.</p>
                    <p>cement showed a gain of L. E. 9,660. In this latter division, Belgium
                        supplied L. B. 6,944 and Great Britain L. E. 2,286.</p>
                    <p>ENGLAND'S SHARE.</p>
                    <p>Out of the total imports of L.B. 2,721,461 Great Britain was credited with
                        L.B. 886,417, whilst ber share of Egypt's additional trade during the month
                        was L. B. 107,950, giving the satisfactory percentage of 49.7.</p>
                    <p>Excluding the metal division, the main movements in England's olearances
                        compared with last year were as follows:-</p>
                    <p>INCREASES</p>
                    <p>Manchester goods L.E. 86,962, coal L.E. 12,200, flour LB. 8,148, and far-
                        niture L.B. 6,398.</p>
                    <p>-</p>
                    <p>DECREASES. Mathematical and musical instruments L. B. 9,140, and jewellery
                        1.E.3,684. In metals, the combined machinery olasses showed an expansion of
                        LB 0,756, whilst the railway supplies were L.E. 67,775 lower.</p>

                    <p>The Borderers made their initial appearance at Ghezireh last Saturday, 22nd
                        inst., against the Sporting Club, and at once stamped them- selves as a team
                        of more than average merit, and signalised their arrival by an easy victory
                        over the home team.</p>
                    <p>It was rather after the advertised time, when, having lost the toss, and
                        defending the tennis courts goal, Wyatt kicked off for the club. There was
                        little to choose during the first few minutes and each end was visited in
                        turn, but once the visitors had found their fset and the pace of the ground
                        they began to show glimpses of their form, and frequent bouts of pretty
                        passing brought them within hail of goal. The bome back division were kept
                        continually busy, and although not quite as certain as usual offered a
                        strong resistance. It was evident that the determined attack set up by the
                        regime t must result in a score and at the end of a quarter of an hour a
                        concerted movement on the left wing brought the ball into the centre and
                        Woods again transferring to Forbes, the latter bustled through the remaining
                        opposition and easily beat the fruitless effort of the goalkeeper at rushing
                        out, The club left wing then broke away and on sveral occasions threatened
                        danger; but Douglas was equal to all emergencies. After a short interval of
                        midfield play, Jones raced away and centred well from which Woods nearly
                        scored, but the ball was only partially cleared and Priestly, getting
                        possession well ap, scored with a very clever shot. Starting again the home
                        forwards made rather a better show and eventually got through. Paten and
                        Deacon initiated the movement on the right and Frye, receiving the centre,
                        proceeded to fall over it, but with Douglass out of his goal, he recovered
                        himself suffi iently to roll the ball just over the line. With the score st
                        2.1 ends were changed, and Woods kicked off again. The Borderers were now
                        playing good game and kept the home defence hard at work and before ten
                        minutes had elapsed a further disaster befell the club. Stout seemed to
                        entirely mi-judge a soft shot from the left wing and the goal- keeper, being
                        unable to get across in time, the ball rolled geatly into the corner of the
                        net. Roused to a sense of their responsibi lities, the home team made
                        determined efforts to reduce the deficit. Once Wyatt failed to take
                        advantage of a go'den opportunity and shortly after saw a hot shot well
                        savel by Douglass. The latter on several occasions had shots to deal with,
                        but many of them lacked ating, and Gh-zireh were unable to penetrate the
                        sterling defence pitted against them With Woods scoring a fourth goal after
                        a olever manoeuvre, in which he gave the goalkeeper no chance, the K. O. S.
                        B.'s won their first match by 41.</p>
                    <p>The score hardly reflects the merit of the respective teams, but weak
                        shootings and the mistake of the third goal were responsible for giving the
                        appearance of a run-away victory in what was a good game to watch and not so
                        one-sided as the score would in- dieste. For the club, the forwards were
                        com- bining rather better, but were still very weak in' shooting. Their
                        goalkeeper did many good hings and Wes'ey fed his forwards with his nsual
                        commendable accuracy. The Borderers will prove themselves a great addition
                        to Cairo fotball. They are fast, clever, and play with any amount of dasb,
                        and from a first impression appear to possess in Donglass and Priestley a
                        goal keeper and centre half of distinot ability.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                    <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with

                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at <hi rend="italic">Borgo San Domino</hi> and in half-an-hour

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most

                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
