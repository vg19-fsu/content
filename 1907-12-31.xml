                    <p>In the last published report of l'Institnt Egyptiev, saga "The Lancet," there
                        are two papers by medical men worthy of ateyna, tion. The institute was
                        (founded in 1859 to carry on the litereitid scientific work for which
                        'Institut d'Egypte \Ivas origin-ally created by Napolon.ani_his-limous group
                        of men of science during the. Frecch occupation of Egypt. Until about ten
                        years ago English-men were very rarely admitted to the honour of membership
                        for, in spite of the red coats at headquarters,France still remained in
                        jealously guarded, intellectual occupation of Egypt. Now matters have
                        somewhat changed and no less than eight English names. appear in the list of
                        active members, the number of which is strjetly limited to 50. To the report
                        under notice Dr. Bay contributes a paper on the electric pheno-mena that
                        accompany the "khisausin" wind which in Arabia and Syria is called the
                        "simoom" and bears the name of "sirocco" in Algiers and Sicily. The wind
                        blows intermit-tently from the south during a period of about '50 days in
                        March, April, and May. The heated air collies Straight from the desert
                        charged with very fine dust and sand, ubscunug the sun and compelling people
                        to shut up their houses as far as possible. Tile phenomenon usually lasts
                        only three days, of which the second is the moat trying and reminds those
                        exposed to it of the sensation 01 'standing near a furnace. During the

                        Meanwhile accidents sowitimes occur to the large machines which have
                        receutty been constructed tar supplying electric light. Dr. U. Elliot Smith
                        has been working tor three years at the investigatiou of embalming in the
                        twenty-first dynasty, having been presented with 44 mummies of that period
                        tor the anatomical department, of the Egyptian School of Medicine at Ulm°.
                        These minimum were lomat at Demelthan in 12491. In spite of many authors,
                        and wore contuotures, nobody knows exactly whets the ancient practice of
                        embalming began. In pre-lustunc stays, more than 7,000 years ago, the
                        inhabitants of Upper Egypt exposed their dead to a sun-dry-ing process which
                        has preserved them until to-day. It is suggested that so long ago as the
                        titth dynasty the pyramid builders nude( use of artificial means to resist
                        the nature' -decay of the dead body, but there is no certainty as to what
                        they did. The Cairo Museum shows, by its unique collection ot,niuminiea,
                        that real utuuniticatiun, aided by art, belongs to the period between the
                        seventeenth dynastyand the early days of the sixth century of the Christian
                        era Dr.. Elliot Smith rewinds us that tithing this period ot about 2,000 y
                        the methuths ot embalming' underivent changes. From the eighteenth to the
                        twentieth dynasties the tuethodsiadopted consisted only in the preservation'
                        of\the body and as everyone knows who has seenite Royal Ramo-side mummies
                        this was accomplished so successfully that the nixie employed can will have
                        beeu the result ofcenturnas of experiment. About the begiuuing ot the
                        twenty-first dynasty (a period ut decline, when Egypt was being menaced by
                        victotiuus Assyria) the embalmers initiated a new practice which was an
                        attempt to restore to the shrunken body the form which it had lost during.
                        the (tarty stages ot embalming ; this was dune by packing under the skin and
                        in the cavities linen, sawdust, sand, and other materials. </p>

                        Miller had been conveyed and to attending him. The evidence of three

                        with full pomp and ceremony. </p>
                    <p>At noon all the Government vessels in harbour and H.M.S. "Diana" (Capt.

                    <p>From 2.30 to 3 p.m. those invited to attend the inauguration boarded the
                        "Cuhona," the "Aida," std the "Diana." On board the "Cuhona" the Consular
                        Corps and ' Heads of Departments were received by the Prince ; the 1 guests
                        of the Admiral wore entertained aboard the "Aida," and on the "Diana"

                        officially inaugurated it.</p>
                    <p>On the return of the " Etaif " to the calmer. waters of the harbour, the
                        "Diana" thundered ou t another royal salute to declare that the pass was-
                        open.The "Abbas" and "Teir el Mina" next proceeded through the pass and

                        Grant then paid an official visit to H.H. Prince Ant aboard the "Cu hona"
                        and the Prince on returning the visit shortly after sundown, was greeted

                    <p>'Dear Sir, — The following article is comprised in the "Articles of
                        Association" of a Limited Liability Company pronibted and foisted on the
                        public of Egypt and London some few years ago. It is almost needless to
                        state that this Company has turned ont to be a bilge fiasco, if not gorse.
                        'Nevertheless, I shall be glad if your readers, many of them directors of
                        companies domiciled in London, but having Egypt for their base of operations
                        would kindly inform me if such an article is imposed aq a usual and
                        customary condition ender which shareholders are invited to subscribe
                        capital for Joint Stock Companies.</p>
                    <p>92.— Tout ce qui aura Etafo fait par une As-seiiiblee du Conseil ou d'un
                        Comae de Conseil, ou tau quelqu'un agissant comme Administra-teur,-quand
                        aneme it wait reconnu plus tard y' avast eu nomination do dit

                    <p>Under the above it would seem that an enterprising boab might run the whole
                        show and having collected the shareholders money in every available
                        direction quietly decamps with the connivance, say of the Managing Director,

                        only take the trouble to read the published articles of association they
                        might in some cases save their money—I don't say they would neces-sarily
                        save it, having regard to the facility with which dishonest directors wreck
                        bunt fide concerns here, and escape with impunity, but if a little
                        precaution were taken, andsome few pre-liminary enquiries made, shareholders
                        would less frequently give their support to rotten concerns of which we have
                        had so many instances in Egypt lately.</p>

                    <p>THE SOURCE OF IMPURITIES</p>
                    <p>The report of the Cairo Water Commission, is, in so far as the actual
                        analysis of the water inpply of Cairo is 'concerned, of a very satisfactory
                        nature, as will be seen from one of the =eluding sentences of the report,
                        which runs is 'follows "In brief, apart from the possible aresence of
                        undesirable bacteria, there nothing in the composition of the cater which is
                        capable of giving rise to sickness or disease. It is true that in in earlier
                        paragraph it is stated that the mem-)(ors of the commission are not
                        satisfied that he water supply is entirely satisfactory but ..he
                        difficulties in the way of destroying such impurities as exist in the water,
                        and in re-medying the causes which are said to conduce 10 this opinion do
                        not appear to be very great, the water bearing s trata at Rod-el Farag,
                        affords in the opinion of the commission a eery good filter, and the
                        presence of a small mount of iron and manganese in the water ire the only
                        defects in its chemical composition. These will, however, require to be
                        remov-.K1, and the commission suggests that systematic experiments should be
                        carried out in order to ascertain the best and cheapest method of
                        accomplishing this, and there are several other points in connection with
                        the working Itc. of the wells which are also brought forward is being in
                        need of greater attention than is it present accorded to them.</p>
                    <p>The method of adding aluminium sulphate o the water entering the settling
                        tanks of the Ghizeh supply by the judgnent of the naked :ye alone is
                        condemned, it being considered necessary to introduce the use of apparatus
                        to ceurately measure the turbidity of the water, both previous to and after
                        settling, and the lecessity of absolute cleanliness in dealing cith the sand
                        on the filters is urged by the commission, who also offer many other sus
                        cestions of a technical nature applicable alike o the Ghiteh and Abbassia
                        supplies. In regard to the latter it is stated that the present intake s in
                        an unsatisfactory position and should be come distance from the town, while
                        the practice )f mixing water from this supply with that of Rod-el-Farag is
                        condemned.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the system of distribution the commission points out that this
                        is largely in engineering matter and with the exception perhaps of the
                        suggestion that the mains ohould he laid at a greater depth than at aresent
                        there is nothingjncluded in the report which would not occur to the mind of
                        any modern engineer. It will be necessary, if the !ommission is to be
                        followed by any beneficial Teults for the authorities to take the suggested
                        niiirovements and alterations immediately in land, as it is of little vane
                        possessing a water 'apply which is chemically pure, if impurities ire to
                        creep in through a faulty system of listribution, and it would seem that
                        there is argent need of alterations in that which at sresent exists, and now
                        that the purity of the water at its source has been assured io time should
                        be lostin perfecting the system of supply. It is, as pointed out in the
                        report, difficult owing to the lack of any drainage oyster; to flush out
                        dead-ends where they exist it the poorer quarters and we trust that
                        something definite as to the much-talked-of irainage scheme may be done
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>The scheme is, we believe, one which will put Jairo on a sanitary basis equal
                        to that of any nodern town, and as this will possibly be a cork which will
                        occupy years in its accomplish-nent, it is of the utmost importance that the
                        .ping should be pushed through with the great-$t possible di 'patch. We had
                        hoped that the rear 1907 would have witnessed the conclusion of the
                        preliminaries, but as this is now impoe-ible, we can only trust that the
                        authorities will make up for log time in the coming year, aid that the
                        summer may find the work well in land. Many of thostiggestions embodied in
                        the port of the commission appear to be almost in-necessary at first sight,
                        but it is to obese imall things that many of our European cities swe their
                        sanitary reputation and the commis-ion were wise in insisting upon absolute
                        clean-ineas in the work, no less than upon the eli-nination of chemical
                        impurities from the water-thelf.</p>

                        yield would be worth, and to proceed with the work of reclaiming other land
                        to igriculture slowly and as opportunity present-id itself. It was also

                        <p>On Saturday last two very good matches were played at Ghezireh :-</p>
                        <!--template does not exist for First match-->
                        <p>It was soon apparent the E. A. were out-classed in ponies, and Capt.
                            Harvey had the misfortune to injure his hand half way through the game.
                            The IC.S.0 team won by 6 goals to love. Three of these were scored by
                            Sei ffou Bah Yousry Pasha, whose shooting at goal was very accurate. Mr.
                            Heller seems to have im-proved in his polo and to observe the rules of
                            the game more closely. </p>
                        <!--template does not exist for second match-->
                        <p>This was a most exciting match, very accurate polo being played, and the
                            ground seemed to be in excellent condition. Mr. Evans at No. 1, kept
                            Major Haig, his back, galloping for his strokes, this had a good deal to
                            do with the result of the game Mr. Bowen, Capt Bartlett., and Mr.
                            Schreiber's team lost the first two goals but eventually won by 5 goals
                            to 2. There was a large gathering of spectators watching the match.</p>
                        <p>First ebukker The Dragoons seemed to have rather the best of it, Mr.
                            Schreiber saving his goal several times : Major Ansell scored the first
                            goal for his side just as the' bell rang.</p>
                        <p>Second chukker. From the throw in Mr. Bowen, who is beautifully mounted,
                            came away with the ball and scored a splendid goal with a long high
                            shot. Shortly after this Capt. Bartlett dribbled the ball through from a
                            serimago near goal. Score. Reda.1 goal. Whites 2 goals. Major Haigs pony
                            shying off the ball, let in Capt. Bartlett who again scored. Score two
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Third chukker. After this there was some even play until rapt. Bartlett
                            who was playing beautifully scored again. Reda. 3. Whites 2. Mr. Seymour
                            was the next to score a good centreing back hander giving him nice
                            opening. Score Reds 4. Whites 2.</p>
                        <p>Fourth chukker. Mr. Schreiber was conspicuous his defence being very
                            round, and his back handers all "coming through". The last goal was
                            scored by Mr. Seymour with a very clover back hand shot.</p>
                        <p>FINAL SCORE</p>
                        <p>Major Haig's team 2 goals</p>

                        <dateline>Aden, December 28</dateline>
                        <p>Jedda was lately the scene of great rommo-tion owing to the occurrence
                            of,a destructive fire in one of its principal bazaars. The outbreak was
                            in the khasikiah street which is covered with arcades of planks. Many
                            shops, have been destroyed, the fire having raged for some hours before
                            it could be got under control. The origin of the fire and the damages
                            are not exactly known, but bazaar rumour estimates the damage at one
                            laid' of dollars. It is a great pity that in spite of the liability of
                            buildings to catch fire in these parts there is not a proper fire-engine
                            to check the conflagration on the occurrence of a fire. The want of such
                            an engine is more particularly felt at liodeida, whore a recent fire
                            destroyed more than a hundred huts, nearly half of Hodeida being made up
                            of huts.</p>

                            steamers "Shahs hum" and "Zabinghla" also passed here from Bombay on
                            route to Jeddah with a contingent of pilgrims. </p>

                    <p>The ordinary expenditure for 1908 has been fixed at LB. 259;798 as against
                        L.E. 239,498 in 1907. This increase of L g. 20,300 is chiefly required for
                        strengthening the staff to cope with increased work and to meet the
                        increased cost of transport, rents, etc. Receipts for 1907, estimated at
                        L.E. 260,000, will approx-imately roach L K 295,000. Those for 1908 are
                        estimated at L.E. 280,000. The total number of letters exchanged with Great
                        Britain and her Colonies in 1907 will probably attain 3,571,000 as against
                        2,692,500 in 1906, an increase of over 30%. Sineerthk reduction in December
                        1901 of the cost of Post-age from 10 to 5 millimes, the gross increase in
                        the number of letters despatched to these countries is 107 %, or, after
                        dikincting the probable increase based on chi normal growth of preceding
                        years, 77 %, which must be re-garded as extremely satisfactory. </p>
                    <p>A similar reduiftion in postage with Italy came into force in July 1'06 with
                        the result that the number of letters exchanged in 1907 amounts
                        apprtiximately to 1,191,000 as against 815,200 last year, being an increase
                        of 46 %. The Suction in the price of inland post-cards from 3 to 2 milliemes
                        has been attended with the happiest results. Approximately 2,000,000 cards
                        have been sent this year as against 1,185,000 in 1906; the loss in revenue
                        has therefore easily been covered.</p>
                    <p>The number of depositors in the Savings Bank shows an increase of 12,666 to
                        the end of October and now exceeds 71,000. Although for the first time in
                        its history the monthly with-drawals have on three occasions exceeded the
                        deposits, there still remains an increase on the first ten months of L. E.
                        42,135. The total amount now on deposit is L. E. 373,207. Al though these
                        figures oboe a gratifying increase, it must be admitted with regret that the
                        Savings Bank can hardly be said as yet to have achieved complete success as
                        a popular institution.</p>
                    <p>The number of British postal orders issued amounts to 27,500 for the first
                        ten months of 1907, as against 21,000 for the whole of 1906. </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Who is responsible for the present state of the Ghizeh Gardens? Its
                            changed condition, however, makes our hearts sad. There has been a
                            ruthless destruction; of trees. Some of the finest have been cut down
                            and for what reason do you imagine? To create a kitchen, garden; for the
                            whole plus is little else now. Peas and potatoes are all very well in
                            their way ;1. but to destroy our only spacious and umbrageous garden for
                            their cultivation an act of vandalism in comparison with the removal, of
                            an ancient monument or "modernia, ea" restoration is a trifling
                            peccidilo. Though the Ghizeh grounds are now beautifully laid out for
                            the growing of vegetable, the roads are neglected and one placed next to
                            the ruins of a conservatory there is a thole i many feet deep without
                            any protection. Indeed it is generally filled with water so as,
                            presumably, to render it less easily visible. Cairo is pone too healthy
                            as the weekly statistics fully ,fostify ; and to have destroyed this,
                            its single lung, which used to be the resort on fete days of thousands
                            of tired town-workers, is an offence for which the authorities ought to
                            be held criminally responsible or at least be punished with dismissal.
                            What can be the attitude of minds of people who, in a tropical coun-try,
                            callously order the whole sale demolition of trees- in the vicinity of
                            the capital it is hard to conceive. Lovers of nature they can-not be,
                            still less lovers of their kind. Doubtless they are accustomed to look
                            upon the native Egyptian as barbarous, But surely the barbarian who gave

                    <p>PERMANENTLY CURED BY DOAN'S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS</p>
                    <p>Mr. James Brown, Chirnside, Bridge, Chirnside, Berwickshire, Scotland said :
                        "Since 1902 I suffered with kidney disease, the outcome of overlifting.
                        There were pains across my loins, and the urinary secretions were
                        disordered. I used to feel dreadfully tired on, rising in the morningaiand
                        was troubled very much with chilly sensations, as well as with a bad taste
                        in the mouth. Occasionally I was so ill that I had to stop work.</p>
                    <p>'I had medical treatment, the doctor pro-ouncing my illness to be stone in
                        the bladder. It was not until I used Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, hunger,
                        that I got lasting relief. I found these were doing me good when I had taken
                        two boxes of them. I persevered with the pills, and they eventually put me
                        right</p>
                    <p>(Signed), JAMES BROWN."</p>
                    <p>Nearly a year after Mr. Brown said : "I have the greatest pleasure- speaking
                        for Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, for they have done me a great deal of
                        good</p>

                        by Doan's' 'Backache Kidney Pills, and Ms a pleasure to recommend the
                        medicine most highly.</p>

                    <p>In the second place, I wish to explain the results which have accrued to
                        Egypt from the British 'occupation of the country in 1882.</p>

                        compiling certain 'chapters of Egyptian history. From March 1877 to June
                        1880, and ogain from September 1883 up to the present time (1907), I have
                        been behind the scenes of Egyptian affairs. Besides those sources of
                        information which are open to all the world, I have had access to all the
                        dot:meats in the archives of the Foreign Offices of both London and Cairo,
                        and I have been in close communication with, I think, almost every one who
                        has taken a leading part in Egyptian affairs during the period the history
                        of which I have attempted to write. Thus, I think, I may fairly lay claim to
                        be in a position of exceptional advantage in so far as the attainment of
                        accuracy is concerned.</p>
                    <p>On March 23, 1876, Mr. Stephen Cave, Who had been sent to Cairo, to report on
                        the finan-cial condition of Egypt, expressed himself in the following
                        terms:</p>
                    <p>"Egypt.may be said to be in a transition state, and she suffers from the
                        defects of the sys-tem out of which she is passing, as well as from those of
                        the system into which she is attemp-ling to enter. She suffers from the
                        ignorance, dishonesty,waste, and extravagance of the East, such as have
                        'nought her suzerain to the verge of ruin, and at the same tithe from the
                        vast expense caused by hasty and inconsiderate en-deavours to adopt the
                        civilisation of the West.'</p>
                    <p>An attempt will be made in the following pages to give some account of the
                        measures adopted since Mr. Cave wrote his report, to arrest, as I hope aini
                        would fain believe, to re-medy the disease, whose main features are
                        des-cribed with accuracy in the passage quoted above.</p>
                    <p>I trust that such an account will notbe de. void of interest to the general
                        reader, and that it will be of some special interest to those of thy
                        fellow-countrymen who are, or who at some future time may be engaged in
                        Oriental-adminis-tration. It is to this latter class that I would more
                        especially address myself, for they can appreciate the nature of the
                        problems which have presented themselVes for solution, and the difficulty of
                        solving them, more fully than those who are devoid of special administrative
                        experience in the East.</p>
                    <p>The history of reform in Egypt does not present any striking feature-to which
                        some analogy might not perhaps found in otter coun-tries where European et
                        isation has, in a greater or less defree has been grafted on a backward
                        Eastern government and society.</p>
                    <p>But, so far as I am aware, no counterpart can be found to the special
                        circumstances which have attended the work of Egyptian reform. Those
                        circumstances have, in truth, been very' peculiar.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, onkalien race. the English, have had to control antguide
                        a second alien race, the Turks, by whom they were dislike in the government
                        of a third race, the Egyptians. To then latter, }loth the paramount race-4
                        are to a certain extent unsympathetic.. In the case of the Turks, the want
                        Of sympathy fiss been mitigated by haspit, by a common religion, and by the
                        use of a common fang age In the case of the English, it has been mitigated
                        by the respect due to superior talents, and by the be-nefits which- hau)
                        accrued to the population from British interference.)</p>
                    <p>In the second place, it is to be observed that for diplomatic and other
                        reasons, on which it is unnecessary for the moment to dwell, the Egyptian
                        administration had to be reformed without any organic changes being effected
                        in the conditions under which the government had been condneted prior to the
                        British occupation.</p>
                    <p>It is, indeed, certain that whatever success has crowned the efforts
                        ofieformeikin Egypt has been attained, not in virtue of the system, but in
                        spite of it Those who hold, with the English poet, that "Snatcher is best
                        admi-nistered is best," may perhaps find some co robcration for their theory
                        in the recent histo-ry of Egypt. An experiment under somewhat novel
                        conditions has, in tact, been made in Eastern administration, and, in spite
                        of many shortcomings, this experiment has been crown-ed with a certain
                        degree of success. It is this which gives to Egyptian reform its chief claim
                        to the interest of the political student.</p>
                    <p>I have lived too long in the East not to be aware that it is difficult for
                        any European to arrive at a true estimate of Oriental wishes, aspirations,
                        and opinions.</p>
                    <p>I was for some while in 'Egypt before I fully realised how little I
                        understood my subject ; and I found, to the last day of mriesidence in the
                        country, that I was _constantly learning something. new. No casual visitor
                        can hope to obtain much real insight into the true state of native opinion.

                        interest to the study of Eastern life and politics ; the fact that religion

                    <p>That the pen is mightier than thesword is so trite a remark that an apology
                        is due to my readers for mentioning such a subject. Whole quarries of slates
                        have been filled with essays n this theme in board schools and other places
                        here thechild of the working man is taught to be a nuisance to himself and a
                        Curie to his country. Yet I am still of opinion that the last word has not
                        been said in pods* of the pen, in proof of which I give the folloling points
                        to the cunsidetion of the world - in general Firstly, you can only kill a
                        man bow with a sword and not always that, if the sword happens to be made in
                        England, whereas with a pen you can continuo to attack him before and after
                        death, uutil iuk and grammar fail, or indeed past the latter point, to judge
                        by certain journalistic efforts of the present day. Secondly, with a sword
                        you,can only attack a man,by himself, whereas with a pep you can scarify,
                        not only him, but also his relations up to the ninth aunt, thirdly, you
                        cannot kill anyone with a sword unless you can pane to close range, eheted
                        distance makes no differce once to an attack. with the pen, in fact, some of
                        the most noted exponents of the art., prefer a "safety toile" between
                        themselves and the person attacked. Lastly, to give two military examples,-
                        na sword. ,ever forged.. succeeded.. in anniliihaing an entire jirmy at one
                        blow, whereas- this.surprising feat has just been accomplished by the pen in
                        our own happy isles; and many a General has got himself ifito a greater mess
                        with the.pen. than he ever did with die sword, and I cannot say more than
                        that. Having, I hope, strengthened the read ers belief in ' this hoary
                        example of - the "crawbo repetita," I will' now proceed to give a local
                        example of the teeth of my first tate-went. There existed a few years ago,
                        in a certain- locality which I need not particularise, further; a man who
                        exercised the ancient and lucrative profession of a brigand. It is more than
                        doubtful if he had ever perused tee pages of John Jacques Rousseau, but in
                        prat tree he carried out his theory that "all property . is robbery", to
                        great perfection. In accordance withithesetenets, he placed himself in
                        pokes. sion of Other 'people's property, as frequently-and as
                        unostentatiously as possible. The exi-getioes of- his profession
                        occasionally obliged him to kill as well as rob, whether this is blame-.
                        able or`not depends-to a remarkable degree on sartorial .details. It has
                        been noticed that those who kill in a blue coat with red patches on it,) 10
                        not 1 generally attain a very elevated losition in life, to those, on die

                        highest prizes of life are open The brigand in ques-tion, made a epeciality
                        of removing cattle, and hid, at the time of which I speak, carried out his
                        socialistic theories so thoroughly, that the inhabitants of the district
                        placked up their courage and complained to tbe Mudirieh. The latter, justly
                        annoyed at this replied firstly, that they bad not been stolen. The
                        inhabitants then approached the.Bash-katib in the way in which Bash katibs
                        are' ' best approached,, and finally some ieeffec-teal stops. were taken. It
                        is perhaps_ not greatly to be, wondered at that the steps taken were
                        ineffectual, seeing that the police generally p9rsued their inquiries in the
                        spirit of Doh errs and Verges; and whenever they wished to "apprehend a
                        rogue," - and "lie - would not stand," presently "called the watch
                        together", Egyptire woke up the gaffirs, and , "thanked' God they were. rid
                        of a rogue." It will be remembered that I am speaking of ancient days, when
                        the Acadhnie Abd el:Aziz, or the "Slop's Sandhurst," did not exist to
                        furnish us *with those stalwart Itufe in blue, at once the , admiration of
                        the tourist, and the terror of the malefactor. Rendered desperate by
                        continued riti,i1g, the inhabitants despatched a complui9rto Cairo, to see
                        whether that would have auy effect The Government at once came to their
                        assistance, and sent out a circular on tle s ubject. 'the brigand, as a
                        "countercheck quarrelsome," Made another raid and carried of more cattle. t

                        shown Separately under the beading of "observations." The brigand, quite
                        undisturbethby these severe measures, of which indeed Ale was quite
                        un-aware, still persisted in stealing cattle. The Gpvernment then lane a
                        proclamation-to the Mudirieh to the effect that the brigand was a
                        "dangerous, inconvenient, and insaltibrious . establishment," and was to be
                        closed at once. The Mudirieh replied with humility that t were ready and
                        willing to,close the brigand', but that he persistently.- and feloniously
                        ab-stained from being caught Various Omdebs arrested each other's relation,
                        as a mark of good faith, but as they were too numerous to be the real "Simon
                        Pure", not much good was done. After the unwinding of numerous spools of
                        red-tape, and the exchange of several sacks of ungrammatiel correspondence
                        between the Offices concern, the supply of seizable cattle ip the
                        neighbourhood gave ont,and the brigand betook himself to fresh ',asthma,

                        become rich by the si iple method of con! tinuing to live and allow is land
                        to increase in value, until it was worth such as induced him to dispose of

                        confronted kith the problem of what to do with the money. At first he
                        intended to take the advice of the manager of the company to. whom he had
                        sold the lindr and place the inoney_in a bank, but wit ho gathered from the

                        under the influence of a pectoral lozenge, had talked rather too openly of
                        his wealth and even even thrown out some vague hints as to what it was
                        deposited. Mons , Bitters/pricked-. p his ears. He did. i not see any
                        imtnediate ad, antage to be pined by his knowledge, but yet; He made up
                        ether prescription for his friend, "exhibiting " patience,' if not skill,
                        and returned home thoughtful In most walks of Moak. the man comes home
                        thoughtful, the woman at once suspects another-c6man ; when the wo-man comes
                        home thoughtful, the man suspects another man, i.e. himself. This is a
                        beautiful revisit of nature, and, holds good in all I climes and amongst all
                        -tithes. Madame Bitters, then, in accordance with this universal rule,
                        jumped to the concles4n that some other woman was .ccincerued, and as the
                        happened to hate her husband, naturally bated the sup-positious woman worse
                        for not bating him too. She happened to be wrong. There is a very old <cb
                            n="3"/> adage that great minds.think alike. Mons A. Bitters had a great
                        mind and so had oarfriond the brigand. The latter in his search for fresh
                        pastures in which to exorcise his talents, bad moved to the $411110 village
                        inhabited by the other actors in- this tale Ile too was a client of Mons
                        Bitters, and had the same desire to soothe his symptoms with the paregoric,
                        before mentioned. He and the native therefore happened to meet at the
                        "pharmacy," and listened to each other's rather loosely jointed converse
                        tion. The details of the brigand's past did not interest the wive, but the
                        details of the natives's present interested the brigand' very much indeed.
                        He did not see any immediate advantage to be gained by his knowledge, but
                        yet; It was here that the juncture of two powerful minds took place. The
                        awns fond wish came simultaneously to the mind of the rude brigand, user of
                        the sword, and to the mind of the cultured European, wielder of the pen.
                        This may be accounted for by telepathy, by thought transference, or even
                        by,:another motive. I will however no longer play with my readers, I will
                        gives name to this !native, which actuated two such different persons, they
                        _both desired to transfer)the native's banking account to their own credit.
                        That they did so desire, may be to their credit or it may not ; that is no
                        affair of mine, I Simply relate what happened, and the different methods
                        each adopted to its ends. The brigand, after several conversations with the
                        native, began to have a fairly clear idea of where the money was hidden.
                        Once that was ascertained, the rest was plain sailing to a man of his
                        profes-sional ability. The only thing that worried him was the exact amount
                        of the money. If there was as m-Eich as he hoped, it would be impossible to
                        remove it all without a con-federate, and 05 these- he had a wholesome
                        dread. lie had had before now to "remove!' a confederate, because to his
                        -simple- mind, distrust of the future actions of a past assistant was
                        painful to his inner-feelings. On the other hand, if hehad to leave any
                        money behind ha %could experience those poignant, feelings of regret., which
                        fill the mind of the company-promoter, who has only got £50 out of the a
                        idow, when he might have got .£100. At last he determined to go by himself,
                        and trust to luck. He had not much fear of interruption. The house was in a
                        lonely position, and as the local authorities, in that spirit of fair play
                        that should obtain between governors and governed, invariably allowed it to
                        be known in which direction the patrols were going, he did not wanrouolt.
                        tliought on their movements ChoO-ing a night when he knew that the patrols
                        were going in the opposite direction, he set outi with his gun and his
                        burglar's housewife. Unfortunately for him, two events had taken place on
                        which he had not reckoned. The:find was that Britannia had been seized with
                        one of those fits of politic' flatulency, that occasionsaly afflict the old
                        hialy, and had expressed a wish that the natives s.houla be taught to help
                        themselves. I may mention that .thy brigand had been helping himself for
                        year without any instruction, but this is by the way. The second was that an
                        English inspector had come down to inspect. In accordance with the wishes'
                        of Britannia, he was bent on helping the natives to help themselves, and
                        considered that the best method was to catch any native he saw helping
                        himself Ho therefore made the patrol go back ors their traces, and caught
                        our friend creeping along with his gun and his bag of tools, which he was
                        too taken by sur-prise to throw away. Utterly flabbergasted at his capture,
                        he could make no valid defence, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment
                        as a suspicions character When released he had quite lost his nerves and his
                        connections, met sank down to the position of "Tahsilgy" to the M infidel).
                        Sword having thus failed utterly, let us see what pen can tip. Mons Bitters
                        adopted quite different tactics, violence not being in his line. The problem
                        he had to solve was, givenof money in the possession of some on else, l 44
                        ow induce the itaiin littler to entenst hirb with the amount. He reflected
                        that faith, hope and charity were all cardinal virtues, but hope seemed the
                        one best suited to his purpose. He therefore had to devise a plan which
                        would cause the native to hope for such gains, by investing his money ender
                        his directions, as would enable him to get the treasure into his own
                        possession. After which epoch, felt would resume her sway oter the native
                        until charity stepped in and did the test. Ile commenced his plan of
                        campaign by going tae see a European in the next Market,kho had some
                        valuable land for side. He informed him that he knew of a very rich native,
                        who was disposed to "give a large price for good land. He proposed to bring
                        the native to inspect the land, and asked the owner not to sav anything
                        about the price at the first visit, but to leave it to him. The owner agreed
                        to this, and promised him a bonus if the Kale came oil Ile then began to
                        throw out hints to the native that he knew of some really valuable land
                        going dirt cheap, as the owner was obliged to sell, and did not know the
                        value of his property, and regretted that he had not the money to buy the
                        property himself. The discrepancy between his two statements would be called
                        a lie in tho kitchen, and the artistic instinct in the draw-ing room. The
                        native, who bad the earth hunger of all tillers of the aod, rose at the
                        bait, and asked for details. These were Supplied to him in driblets to
                        increase his eager-ness, and finally he Wan taken to see the land in
                        question. Before going, he was warned not to mention anything about the
                        price to the owner, but to leave everytbing to Mons Bitters, who undertook
                        to get him the land at a very low figure. To this he agreed, and on seeing
                        the land, saw that the figure mentioned by Mons Bitters, was absurdly small,
                        and depart-ed, chuckling to himself at the stupidity of the owner, and
                        licking his lips at the thought of the fine bargain he was going to make
                        Snnn atter. Mons Bitters came to see him. <cb n="4"/>

                        native, who left for Cairo by the "Mustaagleli", which being in Egypt, is of
                        course the slowest train of the day. Arrived at Cairo, he was drifting
                        helplessly about the platform, bewildered by the crowds, when . someone
                        knocked up against him, and immediately after greeted him by name. He
                        re-minded the native that they had met some years before, and asked many
                        questions about the district, and mutual friends. The native, overjoyed to
                        meet a friendly spirit in a strange land, responded to his overtures in the
                        most open way, suspecting nothing although he could not recollect meeting
                        the affable stranger. He gladly accepted the str'anger's offer to show him a
                        quiet place for the night, and thee' two hobnobbed over a cup of coffee,
                        until the native began to feel sleepy, and retired to rest. On awaking next
                        morning, is it necessary to add that he could not find the purchase money
                        which he had had secreted about his person, nor could he find the affable
                        friend of the previous night 1. The latter indeed, was no other than our old
                        friend Mons Bitters, who leaving by the express, had preceded the native by
                        some hours The possession of the title deeds still afforded him a certain
                        amount of relief, until, on has ing them read to him, he found that he was
                        in possesion of an inter eating document, which stated in formal language
                        that if Mons Angostura Bitters bad happened to die several years ago, his
                        inconsol-able relatives would have received £20 from that flourishing
                        society, The Mutual Provident Society of the Sandwich Isles Ltd. As to Mons
                        Bitters, he returned immediately to the shores of Barataria., where he tits
                        at once made a member of the National Assembly, on which august body, his
                        speeches on the necessity of checking corruption in the commercial world,
                        made a great, and well deserved effect, and there I think we will leave him.

                        the pen, is stronger than bluster, or the sword. </p>

                        amélioration partielle dés prix, un peu parce que les ven-deurs s'étant
                        retirés quelques titres ont béné-ficié d'une demande suivie et aussi parce
                        que les agents ont voulu forcer la ,note et inaugu-rer la nOnvelle année à

                        publions aujourd'hui les tableaux des valeurs en fin décembre 1905 et 1906
                        afin qu'on puisse comparer les prix à ces diverses époques. On verra
                        l'énorme moins-value subie par nos valeurs au cours de la crise financière
                        qui pèse sur le pays depuis bientAt deux ans. Il est à espérer que l'année
                        19084verra la fin de cette situation qui, si elle se prolongeait,
                        atteindrait plus profondément enoorele crédit de l'Egypte. Comme à
                        l'occasion de la fête du Nouvel Ans la corbeille des valeurs restera fermée

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night

                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
