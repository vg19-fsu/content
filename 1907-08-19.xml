                        adding that the walls which are between the Postmaster's house and the
                        neiglıbouring house were in a precarious condition. The administration
                        therefore sent the papers to the inspector, ordering him to proceed to
                        Samanoud and have the necessary repairs carried out. Unfortunately the
                        inspector did not arrive until after the disaster.</p>

                    <head>FIRE IN CAIRO</head>
                    <p>A fire broke out in the premises of the lo Ariston Aerated Water Company
                        situated opposite the Tramway Company's terminus. In at Boulac, at seven
                        o'clock on Friday morn-la ing, and the flames obtained almost complete
                        mastery before the brigade arrived on the scene, owing the call being
                        received late. In spite of all obstacles, however, the brigade obtained the
                        mastery of the flames in a comparatively short. space of time, but the
                        premises were completely gutted. Great credit is due to the firemen for the
                        manner in which the area of the conflagration was restricted, especially in
                        view of the fact of the inflammable nature of the surrounding buildings and
                        their contents, consisting I ti in many cases of forage: the contents of the
                        burnt building, or shed, consisted of chemicals of a dangerous nature and
                        every-Jan thing contribued to promote a good blaze. Io We learn that the
                        building and stock were covered by insurance but that the damage amounts to
                        some two or three thousand pounds. The owners, the Ariston Aerated Water
                        Company have already made arrangements for their clients to receive their
                        supplies in the usual manner and the Company will probably install a new
                        factory in the north of Cairo where it is believed the water is more
                        suitable for the manufacture of mineral waters. </p>

                    <head>CIGARETTE PROGRESS. THE "BLEND" VARIETIES POPULAR.</head>
                    <p>The following article, which will be of interet to many of our readers,
                        appears in the Tribune" of the 13th inst. : </p>
                    <p>When any article attains an almost univeral popularity it may be taken as a
                        general dictum that such a commodity insensibly imroves in value. We find a
                        very clear proof of his statement in the modified attitude of the medical
                        profession to tobacco in general and articplarly to cigarettes. With the
                        constantly ncreasing growth of the cigarette habit the materials which go to
                        their manufacture have teadily shown increased purity and all-round
                        mprovement. Especially is this so with the theaper brands, where the demand
                        has become enormous that the mannfacturers have found </p>
                    <p>possible to offer the public far finer and more delicate tobacco and yet reap
                        arger harvests of profit. A striking exam. le of this improvement may be
                        found in the progress of the "blend" cigarette. "hese in bygone days, when
                        not offered the ublic at extortionate prices, were practiclly unsmokable and
                        full of the most injaious ingredients. Today we find this entirly changed,
                        and whereas years ago one ould seldom find a doctor who would smoke
                        "blended" or "mixture" cigarette many do to-day without experiencing the
                        slightest </p>
                    <p>effects or throat irritation. Cigarettes omposed of blended
                        tobaccos—"mixtures" s they are now popularly termed-are now n the market in
                        any number of varieties nd at astonishingly low prices. These "La akia,"
                        "Turkish," and "Egyptian" blends, ogether with many Virginian mixtures, are
                        fa purity and value undreamt of by the igarette smoker of moderate means who
                        lived n other days. And their variety in such hat they may be said to cater
                        for all alates. Nearly every shade of taste and roma may be obtained now at
                        a comparaively trifling cost, though, of course, there re certain varieties
                        that will always, from heir inherent qualities of individual fragrance und
                        delicacy, command a price above the </p>
                    <p>verage. It should also be noticed that the paper has shown an improvement
                        commenurate with the progress of the cigarette's chacco. Coarse, thick
                        sticks or hard paper s now difficnlt to find even in the cheapest igarette
                        packets. The paper is now, with very few exceptions, of a high grade and
                        quality, and entirely devoid of what used to be called "taste." </p>
                    <p>This general progress is as marked in the bure Virginia cigarette so
                        ubiquitously popu. ar as in the blend varieties and those composed of
                        Turkish and Egyptian tobavco. A Few years ago it was common to hear smokers
                        Domplain that this or the other brand had hope </p>
                    <p>essly deteriorated, but the remark is seldom or ever made to-day unless
                        someone is referring co certain old-fashioned varieties that have Ilmost
                        entirely fallen out of public favour. The nost universally-smoked packet
                        cigaretteshose, indeed, that may be said by long and ionourable careers to
                        have established for hemselves classic repntations-maintain a teady and
                        level plane of excellence that never luctuates on the downward scale. One
                        buys hem with a perfect and absolute knowledge of vhat one is about to
                        smoke. They enjoy as ertain and unvarying a value as an English overeign,
                        and in this respect it may be acceptd as an undisputed fact that British
                        manuacturers have gone far ahead of their foreign ivals. </p>
                    <p>Several prominent manufacturers interiewed during the week on the progress of
                        the igarette and its general inprovement attributed he increased excellence
                        to three sources: Competition, finer machinery, and larger ales." It does
                        not seem prossible to better this xplanation. As one manufacturer remarked :
                        The public of to-day has become so fastidious nd has so many brands at its
                        disposal that iere our cigarettes to deteriorate for a single reek our sales
                        would in all probability drop to </p>
                    <p>half of their present extent. It is a mistake D suppose that the man in the
                        street is no ritic. He knows also when he is not getting it." </p>

                    <p>No subject is receiving more public atte |tion at the present time than that
                        of t maintenance of the navy at a proper standa of efficiency. It is
                        recognized that in case I hostilities the United Kingdom would have depend,
                        first of all, and chiefly, upon t warships which guard our shores. The Briti
                        navy must be kept at a sufficient strength repel any possible attack, and
                        the Governme cannot be allowed to carry their pet policy the wholesale
                        reduction of the national e penses to an extent which would weaken o first
                        line of defence. In this connection, tl remarks of Lord Charles Beresford at
                        Liverpo yesterday are worth pondering. His Lordsh has been one of our most
                        successful com manders, and his speeches in reference to ti navy come with
                        the weight that long conne tion with the service and personal knowled of war
                        conditions alone can give. He said we hi a splendid navy. What was necessary
                        to make efficient was to have a striking force . with 8. component
                        parts-battleships, armoured crui ers, cruisers, scouts, and torpedo
                        destroyer] ---always working together, ready for instai | action, and to
                        support that, an efficier reserve which could be by training in peac rapidly
                        and quickly expanded to help thi striking force. Lord Charles went on 1
                        remark that if there was anything it w his duty to report to the Government
                        I to methods which were inefficient the coui, try might depend upon it that
                        he woul do it. This assurance is one of considerab value, for no Government
                        whether Conserx tive or Liberal, could afford to disgregas the views of a
                        naval expert of such big standing. </p>

                    <p>Mrs. Sarah Coulston, of 7 Quarr, Shepton Mallet, England, says : "Doan's
                        Backache Kidney Pills, have been a boon to me. Follow ing the birth of my
                        13th child, I was taken, with serious kidney trouble ; there were severe
                        pains in the lojns, and the right side of my body swelled from head to foot. </p>
                    <p>"For three months was so ill that I couldn't get about the house ; I have sat
                        for hours at a time holding my head, and I have been greatly troubled with
                        dizziness. </p>
                    <p>"At length I was reduced to such a low and weak condition that I thought I
                        was dying. The doctor did all he could for me, but he was obliged to own
                        that there was no hope for me unless I went into the hospital. However, it
                        was impossible for me to leave the little ones. Happily, my mother told me
                        about Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, and on her advice I gave them a thorough
                        trial. From the first they seemed doing me good, and with the fourth box the
                        swellings began to disappear, and the pains were not so bad. I am now better
                        in every way, an the greatest praise is due to Doan's Backache Kidney Pills.
                        I shall always be pleased to recommend them. </p>
                    <p>(Signed) "SARAH COULSTON." When the kidneys are well, they filter out from 3
                        lbs. to 4 lbs. of watery waste (urine) | every day. You can soon tell when
                        this work ig not being properly done, because the impurities will cause
                        urinary disorders, gravel, pain in the back and loins, dizzy spells ; every
                        change of the weather will affect you, making you feel miserable, weak and
                        nervous ; watery swellings may appear beneath the eyes or in the ankles, the
                        sight will be blurred. </p>
                    <p>Doan's Backache Kidney Pills assist in filtering out the poisonous waste, by
                        reviving the activity of the kidneys, and restoring 2 natoral action to the
                        connective organism. </p>
