                        Spanish treasure ships at Vigo in 1702, after which it went to the West
                        Indies, whence it returned, and remained at home until the spring pt 1709,
                        when, at any rate, a part of it joined Marl borough's army in time to share
                        in the famous victory at Malplaquet (11th September, 1709) At the storming
                        of Douay it suffered loss. It was also at Bouchain It was predominantly
                        engaged, likewise, at Pouta Vendin, and in other actions in Marlborough's
                        campaigns After the peace of l'tracht the regiment was many years at home
                        About this time, from</p>
                    <p>1738 to 1748, it was commanded by Chas Howard, second son of the third Earl
                        of Carlisle, and one of George the Second's "captains. Having green facings,
                        it became known is the "Green Howarda," to distinguish it from the Bafts,
                        which were then known as "Howard's" after their colonel. George Howard, who
                        commanded that regiment for a long period. The regimental connection with
                        Yorkshire probably commenced at this time, although the regiment did not
                        receive its county title until 1782</p>
                    <p>In 1774, the Regiment went to Flanders and there made a name for itself in
                        many bard fought actions notably at Fontenoy, where the British were basely
                        deserted by their Datch allies Roucoux, Val, etc.against six times their own
                        numbers. It was whilst on this service that fifes were first introduced in
                        the Britsb service and the Green Howards were the first to use that musical
                        instrument At the outbreak of the Seven Years War it raised a second
                        battalion, which was formed into the 66th Foot, and is now the 2nd Royal
                        Berkshire Regiment late at Alexandria The 19th, the regiment now began to be
                        called, took a prominent part in the famous siege and capture of Belle Isle,
                        outbe coast of Brittany, in 1761; and subsequently was stationed at
                        Gibraltar, whence it returned home in 1771 It went out to Charlestown,
                        Carolina 11 1781, and was present in the wins at Monks Corney, the relief of
                        Port Ninety Six, and the action at Eutaw Springs, and went through much
                        harassing work up to the departure of the troopa and "loyalista" in
                        December, 1782, when it removed to Barbadoen, and ultimately to Jamaica,
                        where it remained until 1791 At the outbreak of the French war the regiment
                        formed part of the expedition which cooperate with the French Royalists at
                        Quiberoni, and afterwards landed at Ostend. It served the campaign of 1794
                        under the Duke of York, and shared in the disastrous winter retreat through
                        Holland and West</p>

                        lo 1796 It went out to India, and soon after we went</p>
                    <p>Ceylon. A detachment of five companies was sent to Madras in 1799, and took
                        part in the capture of Seringspatam These companies were intended to
                        accompany Baird's expedition np the Red Sea to Egypt, but instead went back
                        to Ceylon. The regiment was employed at Kandy at various times, the massacre
                        of one of its detachments, in 103, Wu of the most tragic character. The
                        regiment was employed for some time in the Travancore district, and sent
                        four companies to Isle Rodriguez, which took part in the capture of
                        Mauritins (Isle of France, in 1810 It was also engaged in the Kandyan War of
                        1817 18 19, returning home in 1820, after twenty three years continuous
                        service in Ceylon and the Past ludice It served in Demerara and the West
                        Indies from 1826 to 1836, and in Malta, the louian Islands, the West Indies,
                        and North America from 1840 to 1850.</p>
                    <p>At the outbreak of the Russian War, the 19th was despatched to the seat of
                        war and earned new laurels at the Battle of Alma where it suffered
                        considerably in the attack of the Russian guds, it lorses being two

                        files opposed to it. Three companies rendered invaluable service in enabling
                        General Codrington to hold the celebrated "Victoria Ridgo throughout the

                        the quelling of the Mutiny, remaining in India till 1872, during which
                        period further bonours were won in the Hazarda Expedition and the operations
                        against the warrior tribes of the Black Mountain, gaining the thanks and
                        praise of the Viceroy of India. The second battalion w wided to the regiment
                        in 183 In 1881 the old number was discarded and the regi ment received the
                        designation of the Princess of WalenYorkshire Regiment Three years later,
                        the 1st battalion was engaged in the Nile expedition, and the subsequent

                        of Ginnin. Two years were spent on the banks of the Nile, and no battalion
                        could wish for a harder time than fell to their lot in the waste of sand. In
                        1999 when the Boer War wm looming the 1st Battalion was recalled home from
                        Gibraltar and rapidly mobilised for active service. It embarked for the Cape

                        Atter a month's hard fighting in the Colesberg distriot the battalion joined

                    <head>ENGLISH COMPANIES IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>AN IMPORTANT DECISION.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon the British Consular Court at Alexandria pronounced
                        judgment on &amp; case of the highest importance to the many companies,
                        registered under the English Companies Acts, but whose sphere of operations
                        is in Egypt, and whose boards are wholly or I partially composed of
                        non-British directors. In October last an English shareholder in the Bourse
                        and Banking Company of Egypt Limited applied to the British Consular Court
                        at Alexandria for the removal of Mr. Alfred Nahren. the liquidator of that
                        Company, on the grounds that he was administering the state in the interests
                        of the directors. The liquidator pleaded that the Consular Court was
                        incompetent to decide the case. The Court held that in as such as the
                        applicant was a British sobject and the Company was registered under the
                        English Companies Acts, therefore it bad jurisdiction. The liquidator then
                        appealed to H.B.M. Supreme Consular Court for the Dominions of the Sublime
                        Ottoman Porte and the appeal was heard in December last, Judge Cator
                        upholding the judgment of the lower court. Yesterday the original
                        application was renewed before the Consular Court. Mr. Reginald Silley, with
                        whom was Mr. Gooding, appeared for the applicant and the liquidator was
                        represented by Mr. Whitworth. Mr. Reginald Billey argued that the liquidator
                        should be removed on the grounds that he bed shown partiality in favour of
                        the members of the board of directors, such partiality being proved by the
                        fact that he had refused information to the present applicant and caused
                        difficulties to shareholders in the obtention of their share warrants, thus
                        preventing them from exercising whatever voting power they had and 80
                        increasing the intinence of the Board, notably Messrs. Arditi. A second
                        point was that, Mr. Nabman, being a non British subject, the penalties
                        provided by the Companies Acts for failure to comply with the same by a
                        liquidator, could not be enforcer against him personally. As an example
                        counsel quoted section 15 of the Act of 1890, which imposed a penalty of £50
                        per day for noncompliance with the provisions of that section. Mr. Silley
                        then quoted the case or the Sir John Moore Gold mining Company (reported in
                        12 Chancery Division, wherein a shareholder had sought for the removal of a
                        liquidator on the grounds of his having refused information to the applicant
                        and having expressed favourable view, with regard th the conduct of the
                        directors of the Company. This Case went to appeal and the late Lord Justice
                        Jessel, Master of the Rolls, confirmed the removal of the liquidator on the
                        above grounds. Mr Silley furthermore contended that the present case was
                        even stronger than the one cted 'This in the barenbiders 'had in that one
                        brieted counsel to appear and op pove the removal on the ground that they
                        were all satisfied with the liquidator. More over, quoting the words of the
                        learned Lord Justice, Mr. Silley contended that "owing to his (the
                        liquidator's) intimate connection with and favourable disposition towards
                        the Directors," he was a person "onfitted in the wide and general sense of
                        the term to hold the position of liquidator." Counsel contended that this
                        was suthcient without shy morn impropriety on the part of the liquidator,
                        which was not alleged in any way by the Applicant</p>
                    <p>Mr. Whitworth, for the defendant, contended that the affidavits filed were
                        unreliable as evidence and furthermore that the only serious point was the
                        alleged refusal of the liquidator to give information to the applicant. He
                        quoted the case of the Adam Byton Company Limited reported in the Chancery
                        Division), to show that the Court was bound to consider the real and
                        substantial interests in the liquidation, and that therefore the Court
                        should not act simply on the judgment in the case quoted by the
                        applicant.</p>
                    <p>Counsel contended that the written application for information had been made
                        under &amp; wrong section of the Act and so the liquidator was not bound to
                        answer it. Mr. Whitworth went on to say that the case had been bolstered up
                        by unauthorised reports in the newspapers, and asked the Court to express
                        &amp; sting op! nion upon the case</p>
                    <p>Mr. Silley in reply pointed out that the case quoted by the other side did
                        not affect the previous decision because it merely gave additional reasons
                        for removing a liquidator. Counsel contended that the applicant had acted
                        with great public spirit in bringing this question of principle before the
                        court. A great deal had been said about the facility afforded by English law
                        in company formation, and foreigners, who took advantage of these facilities
                        and enjoyed the privileges of Englisb law, should be also made to feel the
                        responsibilities of that law</p>
                    <p>The Judge, in summing up, said that he had come to the conclusion that a case
                        had been made out for the removal of the present liquidator. If for no other
                        reason, the difficulties of enforcing penalties against a foreign
                        liquidator, dealing with assets of a British Company, would be a sufficient
                        ground for removing him. In the opinion of the Court it was undesirable that
                        the voluntary liquidations of Britieb Companies should be confided to any
                        but British subjects. The Court therefore ordered the removal of the present
                        liquidator, but felt some difficulty in choosing there and then a successor.
                        Counsel for the applicant submitted that under the section of the Act the
                        Court must itself proceed to nominate a liquidator and that, pending such
                        nomination, be asked the Court to direct the Registrar to take possession of
                        the books, papers, accounts and monies of the Company. Mr. Nahman agreed to
                        hand these over and the Court accordingly gave directions.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>The costs were ordered to be paid out of the funds of the Company.</p>
                    <p>Now ensued a highly interesting episode. The Marshal of the Court,
                        accompanied by Mr. Gooding, proceeded to the offices of the Company which be
                        found closed, with a notice on the door referring ballets to the offices of
                        Mr. Nahman. The Marshal and Mr. Gooding straightway proceeded to Mr.
                        Nabman's offices and demanded delivery of the books, etc. Mr. Nahitnan
                        informed them that he was an Austriah subject and would not give up the
                        belongings of the Company</p>
                    <p>If anything was wanting to justify the view of the Court as to the absolute
                        necessity of removing Mr. Nahuan and the undesir ability of allowing
                        foreigners to deal with assets of British Companies, Mr. Nahman's attitude
                        provides a complete justification and will not, it is feared, in any way
                        contribute to allay the suspicions of the publie us to the state of this
                        Company's affairs.</p>

                    <p>Writing ex officio, the Government in July last made up their minds to reduce
                        the establishment of the Department of Mines, expressing the opinion that
                        circumstances warranted the strictest economy in public finance, and that
                        the present state of the mining industry in Egypt did not call for the foll
                        Department of Mines, which had been considered necessary to carry out the
                        previous decision of the Government to render every possible assistance and
                        encouragement towards the development of the mineral industry as a whole
                        rather than to specialise in gold mines only.</p>
                    <p>The special circumstances which called for a relation came at an inopportune
                        moment, and unless fully understood must be detrimental to the interests of
                        mining in Egypt, coming 29 they do at the moment when the old exclusive
                        concessions expire and the country is for the first time open to all.comers
                        for prospecting the der general licenses, and, more especially, as the
                        Department of Mines would have completed the preliminary examination of the
                        mineral belts by the end of 1908.</p>
                    <p>So far as the examination of the country has been made, there is no doubt
                        that at one period ip ber history mining in Egypt was an important industry,
                        giving employment to many thomadatlakortet, overreger,&amp;c.addnat when the
                        Egyptians themselves recommence the development of the old mines success
                        will assuredly attend their efforts in many instances, but that until local
                        capital and efforts can be induced to take up the mineral industry no very
                        material advance can reasonably be anticipated, except, perhaps, in a few
                        special cakes: this much to be desired phase (conspi cuongly absent in the
                        past) is to a very great extent in the hands of those responsible for the
                        administration of Egypt, and their attitude towards industries other than
                        agriculture. Much may be accomplished by a little sympathy and
                        encouragement, coupled with some practical assistance and demonstration in
                        the more commercial side of the industry, more especially in reference to
                        cements, pottery, faiences, artificial manures, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Under the general policy prior to the present necessity for retrenchment in
                        public finance, local subjects had begun to take an intelligent interest in
                        the possibilities of the mining in dustry, and at least one local syndicate
                        is taking determined steps to open up the old mines and demonstrate their
                        potential value with the help of a three-stamp prospect mill. Certainly it
                        is the first local attempt; but it must not be forgotten that until the
                        middle of 1907 such work by local subjects was impossible owing to the whole
                        of the mineral belts being locked up in the hands of Buropean syndicates
                        holding huge areas under exclusive licenses. Moreover, the Egyptian deserts
                        were a sealed book to inhabitants of the towns on the Nile; and it was not
                        until these river residents bad been taught that the desert areas of
                        mountain and plain were by no means as difficult of access as they had been
                        accustomed to assume that any considerable movement towards their
                        development became possible. Even the prospectors talds of antold wealth
                        could not break down the boundary between the Nile and the enstern regions
                        with their unknown hardships and tertors.</p>
                    <p>Six years ago bardly a native in Egypt understood anything about mines or
                        mining in fact, it was only by holding out consider able inducement that a
                        labourer could be induced to proceed underground at all, and the few
                        fellahin that could be persuaded to leave the Nile had a very real dread,
                        not only of the hardships of the desert bat also of the danger they ran from
                        maltreatment by its inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>To-day, this is all changed; the fellah has no fear of the desert; on the
                        other hand, be is that in his journeyings, risking death by thirst in
                        departhog from the beaten track, and lacking the local knowledge of the
                        whereabouts of wote and water boles. Among the natives who have been trained
                        on the mines are many who prove themselves capable miners, being
                        intelligent, easily taught, and do not </p>
                    <p>require nearly as much supervision as is usually necessary with other native
                        rade in Africa.</p>
                    <p>Local subjects and syndicates undertaking prospecting phoebe great advantages
                        over their less fortunate Buropean competitors and in their understanding of
                        local conditions and <cb n="5"/>language are able to accomplish &amp; mueb
                        greater amount of work for an equal expenditure. Local subjects, however,
                        yet lack the requisite technical knowledge of mining. Mnch of this could,
                        however, be supplied in the first instance by the Government engineers and
                        inspectors taking a kindly interest in their ventures, under which
                        conditions there are many small mines which could be successfully operated
                        by local residents and syndicates. From among them will be mines requiring
                        more capital and skill for their final development, which, no doubt, would
                        be readily forthcoming either from abroad or locally, assisted by expert
                        Enropean engineers, BO BOOD as it was recognised that the onus of
                        preliminary exploration and development was upon the shoulders of the
                        Egyptian himself.</p>

                        circumstances... stanoes of new field, and they certainly have never
                        understood Egypt in regard to her mi Deral industry. To them, a "gold mine"
                        is a "gold mine," and a new field means "gold mines," for the very good
                        reason that the early adventurers in a field must part with a portion or the
                        whole of their wares (usually gold). The old, old story is repeated; the
                        old, old game played to a publiotever gullible when its palate is tickled
                        with tales of wealth It is said that the public learn as time goes on. They
                        do, and they do not for those who learn to day are for ever being replaced
                        by those anxious to learn for themselves what their fathers have already
                        learnt</p>
                    <p>Egypt possesses in her mineral belts gold, copper, lead, sulphur, phosphates,
                        nitrates, emeralds, peridots, and many other minerals of commercial value in

                        surplus funds Many of these mines can be made to pay if reasonably handled
                        and capitalised but the future of the industry lies in the hands of her own
                        people, aided by local as well as ont side capital, and without doubt these
                        latent resources will in due course le developed</p>
                    <p>In addition to the more hazardous side of her mineral industry, exemplified
                        in the nines situated in the desert regions, Egypt possesses in the vicinity
                        of the Nile considerable potential wealth in the development of the
                        manufacture of cements, potteries, friences, chemical fertilisers, &amp;c.
                        Materials for these are in great abundance, and local demand more than sufti
                        cient to warrant their development. Great strides in these latter would have
                        been made during the next two years had the Government been able to carry on
                        the general policy laid down for 1908 and 1909, for not only would their
                        laboratory and pottery works (now lying idle at Edfn have determined finally
                        the commercial value of the clays, refractory anil otherwise, but the staff
                        of the department would have been able to devote its whole energies to the
                        complete preliminary examination of the various mineral belts, phosphate and
                        nitrate areas</p>
                    <p>Maps are now available for practically the whole of the eastern desert, as a
                        basis for correlation and plotting of the data collected for the last few
                        years, and a territory embracing some 70,000 square miles, utterly known few
                        years ago, is now thoroughly opened up</p>
                    <p>It is more than unfortunate that the Government should have felt compelled to
                        economie at the ebb stage of the mining industry, as, in addition to giving
                        a set back to foreign interest, their action in taking away the support
                        previously tendered will ge far to holding back to cal capital and create a
                        want of confidence among many who had begun to take an intelligent interest
                        in the development of Egypt's re sources other than agricultural, finding
                        that they were assured of the best technical advice as the value of their
                        samples and for guidance in their preliminary explorations.</p>
                    <p>Fuel is, perhaps the most difficult subject that local industries have to
                        consider still, the manufacture of cement in competition with it ported
                        cement has been found possible and there is no doubt that serious as the
                        present lack of fuel may be, it is not absolutely an insurmountable
                        difficulty to the manufacture of many products locally in competition with
                        imported articles of a like nature.</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>It is too soon yet to despair of finding fuel in Egypt, for in addition to

                    <p>The Government are still in poesession of a very considerable staff of mining

                        in due course force of circumstances will probably induce local capital to

                    <p>It is very remarkable to note bow the news papers in England have changed in
                        their criti. cism of Lord Cromer. Last year the Conser tive Press could not
                        be too eulogistic as to his services in Egypt, while the Liberal and Radical
                        newspapers were full of carping criticism. Now all this is changed owing to
                        his Lordship's free trade policy. The "Pall Mall Gazette" for example
                        remarks: -</p>

                        that pensions are only for proconsuls is not one that will rally many

                    <p>Vendredi, 31 Janvier On a fait peu de chose ce matin. Il y a eu seulement
                        quelques rares transactions sans im portance disséminées sur toute note. A
                        gnaler pourtant l'United qui a donné lieu un assez fort courant d'arbitrages
                        avec le Caire. Il a été question également de la Cassa di Sconto mais les
                        transactions sur ce titre ne pa raissent pas avoir atteint beaucoup
                        d'ampleur Quelques Agrioole ont aussi changé de mains Dans l'ensemble on
                        avait ouvert en assez boobe tenue, c'est en cours de séance qu'on flechi,
                        pour cloturer faible avec une tendance à la lourdeur</p>
                    <p>Avec un marché aussi restreint on conçoit que les fluctuations n'aient pas
                        été nombreuss et qu'elles dénotent généralement une moins value</p>
                    <p>Parmi les valeurs dirigeantes, l'Agricole fie chit de 8.715 16 et la National
                        Bank de 21 34 21 11/16, tandis que l'Obligation ancienne Crédit Foncier
                        s'améliore de 294 296 1/2</p>
                    <p>Les Privilégiées Tramways d'Alexandrie se relevent de 135 &amp; 137 et le
                        Banco di Roma de 108 1/4 &amp; 108 12</p>
                    <p>Au contraire, le Cheikh Fadl tombe de 90 &amp; NS, I'Urbaine de 8 3 16 3 5
                        32, I'lnion Foncière de 4 516 &amp; 1 9 32, le Credit Franco Egyptien de 4 5
                        32 4 3 32 La Sociéta de Pressage de 29 A 28.</p>
                    <p>Toutes les variations en petites valeurs, l'exception toutefois de la Cassa
                        di Sconto qui progresse de 57 1 2 à 58 3.4, indiquent une moins-value : les
                        Markets passent de 24/3 245 la Port-Said Salt de 10/6 A 10/3 et les Rita
                        Hotels de 3/8 * 11/32.</p>
                    <p>Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de chan gements signaler. Comme on le
                        voit parce bref exposé, la séance de ce matin n'a présente aucun intérêt, et
                        la tendance ne laisse entre voir pour le moment aucune amélioration. C'est
                        une preuve de plas que, malgré l'appui da dehors, notre marché est incapable
                        d'aller de l'avant sans les affaires terme. Toute la ques tion est de savoir
                        si le rétablissement de ce genre d'affaires n'entrainerait peu de graves

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at <hi rend="italic">Borgo San Domino</hi> and in half-an-hour
                        you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
