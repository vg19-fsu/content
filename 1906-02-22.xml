                    <head>THE ALGECIRAS CONFERENCE</head>
                    <p>There can be no doubt that, calm as outward appearances are at Algeciras, a
                        critical stage has be n reached in the negotiations. The minor points are
                        now settled, and the absurd Moorish proposals thrust on one side : But the
                        tw chief questions are those remaining for discussion—the control of the
                        police and the foundation of a State Bank. As regards the former, the
                        compromise recently suggested by France has been rejected by Germany, and as
                        to the latter, we learn to-day that Germany has submitted to the Conference
                        a scheme, wholly ignoring France's preferential position.. Havas telegram
                        states that the "Temps" learns from Berlin that the majority of the public
                        believe in the possibility of an agreement at the Conference, and even hope
                        that it will be arrived at by Germany's granting a few concessions, Very
                        careful handling will be necessary, if an equitable arrangement is to be
                        made: bat, at the same time, Germany can hardly give way completely; without
                        admitting that her whole interference in Morocco was unjustifiable from the
                        general point of view, and unsuccessful from the strictly national
                        standpoint There is a good deal of feeling within the Empire itself that the
                        Kaiser's excursion last April has been of small real benefit, and if Germany
                        retreats on all points, this will become a strong weapon against the
                        Government. German trade in Morocco, though still insignificant in
                        comparison to that of France or England, is yet advancing more rapidly than
                        either, as the latest returns show. It is for this reason, if for no other,
                        that Germany wishes to have some share in the police control, since, if
                        France were supreme, Morocco would possibly, even against the wish of the
                        Republic, become as French as Tunis: and German trade would then stand an
                        exceedingly poor chance. As regards the State Bank, however, even greater
                        caution will have to be exercised. If the police cannot be exclusively
                        French, and obviously not German, it must also be impossible for the man
                        behind the Bank to be German, as capital would give a greeter power than
                        anything else. The French attitude has been so moderate throughout that any
                        reasonable proposals will be listened to: bat even if the Conference is
                        abortive, the position, though serious, will certainly not mean way. </p>

                    <head>THE DESERTION OF MALTA</head>
                    <p>The story in the "Daily Mail" that it is intended to reduce the Mediterranean
                        Fleet to four battleships may be "very like a whale." But there is no reason
                        to disregard it altogether as absurd. Ships are, after all, mobile, and
                        their distribution may be varied from week to week as the international
                        situation changes. We are at present on excellent terms with France and—as
                        always—with Italy. The Russian Black Sea Fleet is a quantity negligible. It
                        is, of course, essential to guard our communications with this country and
                        the East from all chance of surprise, and to maintain the strategic chain
                        which connects as with our allies in the China seas. But there are many
                        considerations, administrative and others, which could be advanced in favour
                        of a new disposition. The ad- vantage of having as many ships as possible in
                        home ports is not to be denied. The ships are kept in better condition, and
                        it is more economical Furthermore, though the invaliding returns from the
                        Mediterranean this year show an improvement, Malta fever has been rife as
                        ever. </p>
                    <p>It is a very serious question whether it is justifiable to use Malta as the
                        headquarters of a great fleet, in view of its general unhealthiness. When
                        one bears that officers playing football or hockey are accustomed to armm
                        selves with Condy's Said or other antiseptic a prophylactic against tetanus
                        should they suffer any abrasion of the skin by contact with the ground, it
                        leads to the conclusion that the soil of Malta is too befouled by consent
                        over- population to make it a safe or desirable place. The effluvium of
                        Valetta Harbour is, of course, a byword. On the core of health alone, there-
                        fore, if the report that the Admiralty intend to withdraw a portion of the
                        Fleet should prove true, there will be no very great regret. But Malta and
                        the Mediterranean are so involved in the tradition of the Navy that it is
                        not easy, it present, to put much reliance on the report. </p>

                        Hotel. has purchased the Dahin building in R m'eh bulevard and farther that
                        it is Mr. Millingen's intention. to transfer his hotel there,</p>
                    <p>Being the proprietor by conjoint possession of a quarter of this building, I
                        beg you to deny the accuracy of this statement, the origin. f which I
                        ignore, in so far as my rights are concerned. Thanking you beforehand.-I am
                        etc., B. D. DAHAN. Alexandria, 22nd February.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Aug. van Millingen was himself our authority for the paragraph, the
                        accuracy of which Mr. B. D. Dahan denies. We have seen Mr. Millingen this
                        morning and h informs us that he has purchased the property from Mr. George
                        Daban and Mr. Leon Dahan, owners of three-quarters of the estate. The
                        question of Mr. B. Dahan's claims will, he asserts, be decided
                        ultimately.</p>

                    <head>WHO IS BAKER PACHA</head>
                    <p>Who the Baker Pachs referred to in our telegrams to-day as being dead is we
                        cannot discover. Col. Valentine Baker, better known as Baker Pacha, died
                        shortly before the collapse of the negotiations for the conclusion of the
                        Anglo Tarkish convention. He was then head of the police, and his death is
                        referred to in all the contemporary works on Ezypt. Lord Milner announces
                        that "after General Baker's death the Gendarmerie was again abolished,"
                        while Mr. Dicey in "The Story of the Khediviate" records his death and
                        declares that after that event Nubar proposed that the head of the police
                        should be a native. There is no Baker Pacha alluded to in the latest "Who's
                        Who." The only other Baker, who was prominently connected with Egypt, was
                        Sir Samuel Baker, who died in 1893.</p>

                        <p>In spite of a cold wind and rather more dnst than was pleasant,
                            yesterday's races went ff very well. The sport was decidedly good;
                            Jenkins, whose retorn to the Turf we are glad to chronicle, and
                            Whiteside won races for Khalil Pacha Khayat, and Mr. Schreiber and Mr.
                            Stout's horses won popular and rather anexpected victories in the 2nd
                            and 4th races. The fields were not very good except in the third race,
                            but the Pari Motael paid well on the winners in three events. We have
                            seen a larger attendance but the preparations for the bazaar and the
                            cold wind no doubt made a difference. We were all glad to see Mr.
                            Aspinall at the races for the first time this seon, and among those
                            present we noticed Gan. Bullock, Mrs. and Miss Bullock, Mr. Higgins, Mr.

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the mostdelightful
                        places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular
                        traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is
                        to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The approach
                        to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port. The town
                        seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
                        stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the

                    <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>

                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbath and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige

                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
