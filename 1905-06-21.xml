                    <p>An accident, which might have had very serious consequences, took place about
                        two hundred yards from the Tewfikieh station, between Teh-el-Baroud and
                        Kafrel Zayat, at 11.28 a.m. yesterday. The last five carriages of the
                        Cairo-Alexandria express left the rails, tearing up the track, which was
                        considerably damaged. One Arab woman was injured and most of the passengers
                        of the five second and third class carriages which were involved in the
                        accident were shaken and alarmed. A wire was at once sent to Tantah, but the
                        | station-master was unable to give any assistance owing to the down line
                        being blocked.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the news reached Alexandria a relief train was sent up which
                        arrived at 2 p.m. and brought the passengers into Alexandria at 4.10
                        p.m.—three and a quarter hours late.</p>
                    <p>An official enquiry is being held into the cause of the accident, which might
                        have had most serious consequences. Had the derailed carriages turned over
                        the loss of life must have been considerable as the train was travelling at
                        a high rate of speed.</p>
                    <p>A Katr el Zayat correspondent informs ns that it is suspected that the gang
                        which was at work "renewing" on the upline extended their operations to the
                        down line, and not being warned by signal of the approach of tire express,
                        failed to replace the bolts of the fishplates properly, with the result that
                        the rails gave way when the train passed over them.</p>

                    <p>A few days ago we mentioned the extraordinarily scandalous state of the lane

                        thoroughfare is due entirely to the slackness of the Alexandria
                        Municipality, whose services, for reasons best known to themselves, allow a
                        horde of disorderly hawkers to ply their callings there all day long and far
                        into the night. The booths of the fruit-sellers, fish-mongers, florists,
                        bean-Vendors, etc., are kept open until an early hour in the morning and the
                        lane has become a noisy, dirty, and disorderly market, which is often the
                        scene of disorder, the most foul language-being used from early noon to dewy
                        eve. We have been asked by many persons to draw the attention of the

                        useless, for up to now nothing has been done to remedy matters.</p>

                        hospital for several months past are now all completed and the new first and
                        second class wards for patients of European nationality on the second floor
                        that has been added are now ready for occupation. This extra accommodation
                        comprises 8 rooms for females and 7 for males, in all 22 beds, besides a
                        sitting-room for the former, 1 service-room with lift to the kitchen, and 2
                        bath-rooms ; a fine broad verandah running the whole length of the building
                        on each of four sides has been added also. On the same floor there-has
                        likewise been erected a room for aseptic operations with two ante-rooms
                        adjoining. The installation of this portion of the new storey, i.e, all the
                        instruments operating-table, sterilisators,is the gift Of Dr. Wild, the
                        principal medical officer, who has connected with the hospital for the past
                        21 years, since its foundation, in fact.</p>
                    <p>The first floor has been entirely repainted and greatly improved, and a lift,
                        which was much needed, has been fitted to communicate with the two upper
                        stories.</p>
                    <p>The whole of these alterations and additions have cost close upon £6,000; as
                        the committee, which is composed of English, American, and German gentlemen,
                        had only a portion of that sum in hand they were compelled to borrow from a
                        local bank the sum of £1,500, which has been guaranteed by three members of
                        the committee until such time as the funds of the institution permit of the
                        liquidation of this loan.</p>
                    <p>The Victoria Hospital of the Deaconesses is pleasantly situated opposite the
                        Cairo Waterworks and in close proximity to the new and fine Abbas boulevard.
                        It was opened in 1884, and during the 21 years of its existence this
                        deserving institution has relieved quite an army of patients of every
                        nationality and creed, for, besides the accommodation for in-patients, there
                        is an out-patients' department where large numbers of the poorer sick crowd
                        daily for medical advice and medicines. The building for the out-patients is
                        at present much too small for the ever-increasing work, and it is hoped next
                        year, should funds permit, to demolish it and erect larger and more suitable
                        premises.</p>

                    <head>POST OFFICE THEFT. ROBBERY OF £800.</head>
                    <p>A daring theft of a registered letter containing banknotes to the value of
                        L.E. 800 has been reported to the General Post Office in Alexandria. Borton
                        Bey is at present at Cairo in connection with the matter, making the
                        necessary investigation before proceeding to Deyrout, in Upper Egypt, to
                        which place the missing letter was addressed.</p>
                    <p>We learn that the letter was sent registered by the National Bank at Cairo on
                        Saturday, and on Sunday news was sent by the post office at the
                        above-mentioned place that the letter had not reached there.</p>
                    <p>The postal authorities inform us that the following are the numbers of the
                        missing notes ; — (for L.E. 100) : 14469 ; 14470 ; 14471 ; 14472; (for L.E.
                        50) : 2783 ; 5874 ; 5355; 3870. Persons into whose possession these notes
                        may come are requested to return them to the National Bank.</p>
                    <p>Our readers will recollect that some six weeks ago another registered letter
                        sent by the same bank from Cairo, and containing L.E. 1,000 in notes, also
                        mysteriously disappeared in the same way, between the Capital and Ghirgeh,
                        and no trace of it whatever has been found since.</p>

                    <p>The case of the theft from the Mahmal is at present receiving the full
                        attention of the Native Parquet, and there is every appearance that the
                        guilt of the four arrested men, whose names we gave in last Saturday's issue
                        of the "Gazette," will be established. The police have arrested one of
                        Androus's brothers on a charge of complicity in the crime.</p>
                    <p>The Parquet has decided to question the chief of the porters of the Mahmal,
                        who is said to have been intimate with Andraous Meloka. Some suspicious
                        marks have been found on the door of the van which contained the treasure.
                        Two fresh witnesses attendants in a Turkish bath, are to be called, It
                        appears that Meloka showed cuts on the side and neck directly after the
                        theft, but told his acquaintances that he had hurt himself in a bath. The
                        attendants assert that when he stripped for his bath he bore quite recent
                        injuries.</p>
                    <p>The Parquet is investigating this clue.</p>

                    <byline>BY P.P.G.</byline>
                    <p>It is not difficult to get up at an unearthly hour of the morning when yon
                        are bound on a long and interesting journey. My packing was done : the
                        excellent Pietro refused to hear a word of my bill till I returned from Ma'a
                        "And when you come back," he added, "you will please take off all your
                        clothes before you come into the hotel, and I will have a bath made ready
                        for you." "Is it as bad as that ?" quoth I, but Pietro held up his hands
                        with a gesture in which pity for my ignorance and abhorrence of the
                        conditions of travel in a troop train were sublimely blended. Then I got
                        into an arabiya and drove off.</p>
                    <p>A good many of my readers must have seen Damascus, so I will spare them any
                        description of my drive. I passed through a variety of bazaars which Murray
                        and Baedeker have made celebrated, and saw many of the types which every
                        self-respecting traveller sees. Circassians, Druses, Kurds, Israelites,
                        Bedawin, and the "shy Bedawin women stealing along with their tattooed faces
                        uncovered."—I quote somebody's guide book from memory,—who seemed to me to
                        be no more shy than the good ladies who accompany gipsy caravans at
                        home.</p>
                    <p>Eventually I arrived at the station, and here I realised for the first time
                        what the Hedjaz line was. There was no platform here and no sort of order
                        whatever. All sorts of boxes and bales lay about in the sand and all sorts
                        of officials in uniforms gesticulated and bellowed. In the station shed some
                        fifteen persons surrounded an Effendi who wrote the tickets out Tickets, as
                        we know them, are not to be found on the Hamidie-Hedjaz line, and yon get
                        instead a paper with your destination and a number of other particulars
                        scrawled on it by the booking office clerk. My turn came at last and I asked
                        for Ma'an. An awkward panse followed, but a letter—the letter—was in my
                        pocket I drew it out, I am afraid with the same gesture with which the hero
                        of the "Family Herald" roman ces draws his revolver and reduces the villain
                        to au impotent and raging silence, and in two minutes I had my ticket and
                        was preparing to board the train.</p>
                    <p>There were further difficulties to surmount. Porters do not abound on the
                        Hedjaz line; one individual whom I asked to help me with my camp—bed and
                        packs, said with some heat that he was a sergeant, at which I was properly
                        abashed.</p>
                    <p>At this moment the carriages of the Railway Commission came bumping up to the
                        station, Mr. Meissner the Director in Chief of the Construction of the whole
                        line, whom I had already met and admired, hastened to invite me to accompany
                        the Commission which was bound for Deraa and, after mildly upbraiding me for
                        bringing no servant, banded my baggage over to an orderly, and presented me
                        to the Os manli members of the Commission H. E. Raif Pasha, Marshal and
                        Chief of the Staff of the Vth Army Corps, now seconded for service as
                        Military Head of the Railway Commission and his lieutenants.</p>
                    <p>The Pasha was a vigorous looking man of about fifty years, with a heavy but
                        intelligent face. He spoke French well and his knowledge of the military
                        aide of Railway Engineering was evidently considerable. With him were two
                        very pleasant and intelligent officers, one a Turk, the other of Arab origin
                        on one side at least, who were to point out a vast number of interesting
                        objects to me in the course of the next few hours.</p>
                    <p>At last the baggage was on board. The guard blew a long blast on a bugle, and
                        we started with a terrific bump in fairly good time. Dera was to be reached
                        at about 2 p.m. and from 10.0 a.m. to 2 pm. the train ran through the Hauran
                        Plain, one of the most fertile and interesting districts in Palestine. (To

                    <p>Cette dernière quinzaine n'a pas été brillante. Non seulement lés positions
                        de beaucoup se trouvaient surchargées, ainsi que nous l'avions prévu, mais
                        une foule d'autres circonstances ont contribué à affaiblir le marché : la
                        qu'on croyait imminente demeure encore problématique ; le malentendu
                        franco-allemand, qui à sa période aiguë a produit un malaise général, n'est
                        pas encore définitivement ap-plani ; les capitalistes partant en
                        villégiature liquident leurs positions et ceux qui restent attendent des
                        jours meilleurs ; enfin les banques elles-mêmes se montrent plus difficiles
                        pour les avances et ne prêtent pas sur les titres nouveaux. Voilà plus de
                        motifs qu'il n'en faut pour expliquer l'état actuel du marché. La petite
                        spéculation, qui avait jusqu'ici sacrifié ses gros titres pour ne pas se
                        défaire des petits avec une perte énorme, n'a pu tenir plus long-temps et a
                        du liquider au mieux, ce qui n'a pas été facile, car aucun capitaliste
                        n'était là pour sauver la situation en absorbant d'un seul coup tout le
                        flottant. C'est donc moins aux titres eux-mêmes qu'aux circonstances
                        défavorables actuelles qu'il fout attribuer la baisse de ces derniers
                        jours.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les valeurs qui se sont maintenues le plus ferme, il fout placer en
                        première ligne l'Agricole, dont le cours débute à 18 11/16 atteint 13 7/8
                        pour clôturer à 13 21/32 ven deurs. La prochaine émission est pour beau-coup
                        dans ce soutien relatif.</p>
                    <p>De 26 3/4 la National Bank ancienne émission fléchit graduellement à 26 9/32
                        ex-droit, prix auquel elle clôture, tandis que la nouvelle émission est
                        demandée à 26 1/2. Cet ecart que rien ne justifie, puisque l'ancienne
                        émission a seule droit an coupon jette un nouveau jour sur la situation de
                        notre place ; il suffit, en effet, qu'on ait peu d'argent à verser pour
                        qu'une valeur y soit aussitôt recherchée et hausse contre toutes les règles
                        du bon sens. Aussi faut-il s'attendre à un revirement dès qu'une
                        amélioration se produira.</p>
                    <p>La Land Bank fluctue entre 9 et 9 3/16, prix auquel elle clôture
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>De 28 11/16 la Daïra fléchit à 28 5/16 pour reprendre un peu plus tard à 28
                        19/32 et finir à 28 7/16. On ne sait rien encore de précis sur la
                        liquidation dont on ne connaîtra les clauses détaillées que vers la
                        mi-juillet.</p>
                    <p>L'action Crédit Foncier fléchit de 823 à 812.</p>
                    <p>L'Investment débute à 1 11/16 pour tomber graduellement jusqu'à 1 5/16, cours
                        auquel on clôture acheteurs. Bon nombre de remisiers et de leurs clients qui
                        avaient fait des reports pour le 15 de ce mois ont été contraints de
                        liquider au mieux ; les acheteurs voyant les ventes continuer se tiennent
                        naturellement sur la réserve. Ou a fait circuler la rumeur de la démission
                        d'un administrateur de cette société, mais cette nouvelle a été de suite
                        officiellement démentie.</p>
                    <p>De 1 1/4 le Trust a baissé un moment jusqu'à 1 1/8 pour reprendre eu clôture
                        à 1 3/16. Nombre de détenteurs de lettres de répartition n'ayant pas encore
                        reçu leurs certificats au porteur se trouvent dans l'impossi bilité de
                        livrer leurs titres, tandis qu'ils sont contraints d'en recevoir des paquets
                        de déten teurs plus favorisés.</p>
                    <p>D'importantes opérations ont eu lieu en Estâtes entre 7/8 et 15/16. Le prix
                        de cloture est 7/8.</p>
                    <p>La Béhéra monte de 45 1/2 à 45 3/4 pour finir à 45.</p>
                    <p>Très soutenue d'abord à 124 1/2, la Banque d'Athènes clôture plus faible à
                        120 par suite de la commotion politique produite par l'assassinat de M.
                        Delyannis.</p>
                    <p>De 2 1/2 la Delta Dand fléchit à 2 1/4 vendeurs.</p>
                    <p>L'Anglo-American Nile ouvre à 5 11/16, cote 5 5/16 ex-coupon et finit à 5 1/4
                        vendeurs.</p>
                    <p>La Salt and Soda retombe de 35/6 à 33. On s'attend à une sérieuse reprise sur
                        cette valeur au retour des capitalistes.</p>
                    <p>La Delta Light monte de 12 15/16 à 13 1/16, mais ne tarde pas à retomber à 12
                        7/8 pour finir à 12 11/16. Ia Deferred baisse de 14 1/2 à 14 1/8 sans
                        affaires.</p>
                    <p>De 7 3/4 la Ramleh Railway à 7 3/8 avec un chiffre d'affaires restreint</p>
                    <p>Les Privilégiées Tramways fluctuent entre 152 et 153 pour finir très
                        soutenues à 152 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Les Dividendes sont plus faibles à 348.</p>
                    <p>L'Urbaine ouvre à 4 5/8, atteint 4 7/8, mais fléchit avec tout le reste à 4
                        5/8 vendeurs. Cette société serait déjà engagée, parait-il, dans plusieurs
                        affaires de premier ordre.</p>
                    <p>Les Splendid Hotels fluctuent entre 4 3/8 et 4 9/16 pour finir à 4 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Les Eaux d'Alexandrie débutent à 15 3/4, cotent 15 1/4 ex-coupon et clôturent
                        à 15 1/8.</p>
                    <p>De 1,130, les Baux du Caire tombent à 1,120 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les Egyptian Markets se maintiennent à 22/3 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>En Filature on ouvre à 11/16, atteint 25/32 pour retomber en clôture à 11/16,
                        avec nombreuses transactions.</p>
                    <p>L'Obligation Crédit Foncier fléchit de 318 à 314 1/2.</p>
                    <p>En somme, la situation n'est pas brillante, comme on vient de. le voir.
                        Certaines valeurs pourraient même fléchir encore davantage avec la
                        liquidation dè fin de mois, à moins qu'un événement favorable imprévu ne
                        vienne changer la face des choses.</p>
                    <p>Le marché a été calme jusque vers midi. A ce moment d'importants rachats ont
                        eu lieu en Investment dont le cours a haussé rapidement de 1 5/16 à 1 7/16
                        forts acheteurs. On a fait 4 à 5000 actions à ce prix. Les positions
                        surchargées étant à peu près liquidées, le mouvement ascensionnel a dos
                        chances de s'accentuer.</p>
                    <p>Certaines valeurs ont profité de cette reprise, mais en général les
                        changements indiquent une baisse : La National Bank fléchit de 26 5/16 à 26
                        1/4, l'Alexandria Water de 15 1/4 à 15, la Delta Light de 12 11/16 à 12 5/8
                        et la Ramleh Railway de 7 5/8 à 7 7/16.</p>
                    <p>Seule la Salt and Soda reprend légèrement de 33 à 83/8 et l'action Crédit
                        Foncier de 813 à 813.</p>
