                        world's history; and the great military catastrophe in Manchuria may well be
                        decisive not merely of the war but of the future of Russian autocracy. While
                        the Government is paralysed by the Terror at home the news from General
                        Kuropatkin's army is ominous. There is no longer doubt that Oyama's true
                        strategical objective has at last been attained, and that the Japanese are
                        in the rear of Kuropatkin and have out to the north the railway on which the
                        existence of the Russian armies depend. Now, unless the Japanese are driven
                        off, which is a most unlikely contingency, Russia will be brought face to
                        face with a tragedy, beside which all that Russia has as yet suffered of
                        disaster and humiliation would be as nothing.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while pausing to consider what the consequence must necessarily
                        be. it must be admitted that in the present case it will be staggering. Not
                        only will the present regime be thrown overboard, and, possibly, even a
                        wholly different form of government imposed. It is not only that the
                        traditional policy of Russia for many generations will, as a matter of
                        necessity, be abandoned, and a wholly different set of activities and
                        developments pursued in its place. Were these all, there might be found more
                        than one parallel for the situation, something to suggest the future of this
                        enormous people. But the real change lies deeper that (TOP the evolution of
                        9 new dynasty, or</p>
                    <p>form of government, or national object is nothing less than the decontiuenl

                        the nations of the old world..</p>

                            concerned in the prosperity of the hospital, which supplies a want felt
                            by all classes of the community, no less than by the English and

                        filled with a large and animated crowd who had been attracted thither by the
                        promise of fireworks and of illuminations on a large scale. The whole of the
                        garden had been hung with multicoloured Chinese lauterus in tasteful design,
                        and there being no moon, the effect produced was extremely picturesque.
                        Electric lights had also been fixed in many of the trees, and the
                        rose-coloured lamps ou the tops of the highest palms completed a very pretty
                        sight.</p>
                    <p>The fireworks were greatly appreciated and confetti were thrown with such
                        vigour, and in such quantity, that the paths were in places almost
                        ankle-deep. In spite of its being rather a cold night, the gardens were
                        thronged till a ate hour, while dancing went on in the Moorish central hall
                        till long after midnight A large number of well-known Cairo residents,
                        including many of the officers of the British and Egyptian forces, took part
                        in the festivities, and with them were a great number of tourists,
                        principally American, who all seemed to be enjoying themselves
                        immensely.</p>
                    <p>Among the diners in the restaurant, we noticed 11.1.H. Prince Adalbert of
                        Prussia, with a party of six, among whom was Dr. Rucker-Jenish, German
                        Consol General. Mrs. Carey also entertained a party of six, and other

                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Others to be seen in the restaurant were the Rt. Hon. J. W. Mellor, Baron

                    <p>There were many supper parties in the grillroom and the gathering did not

                    <p>A financial authority writes :—The promo tion of the Egyptian Estates,
                        Limited, is one of the fairest that 1 know oL The only mistake in the
                        prospectus, to my mind, is the omission to state two points, which, instead
                        of being against; are distinctly in favor of the company. The first is that
                        the directors have taken powers to issue £1,000.000 of debentures.
                        Presumably they would not pay more than 4^ per cent for these and, taking
                        for the sake of argument that they could only make 6^ per cent, on their
                        investments in this country, this would give an extra profit of 4 per cent,
                        on the 500,000 shares capital, quite apart from the profits derived from the
                        investment of the £500,000. The second point that does not appear to be
                        clearly stated in the prospectus is that the ordinary shares not only
                        receive a preferential dividend at 5 per cent but accumulative preferential
                        dividend. They then receive 65 per cent, or two- thirds of the balance, and
                        the directors have full powers to create a general reserve fund before
                        anything can be pai l to tbe deferred shareholders. It /is obvious that the
                        people connected with the company are men of the highest integrity, and that
                        a man, such as Mr. Greville Palmer, who has been director of the Bank of
                        Egypt for 28 years, would not lend his name to any shady adventure.</p>

                    <p>L'lmission des actions de cette sociltl, bien que dljk largement oouverte,
                        n'a pas oepen- dant rencontre la favour des courtiers-remisiero et du moude
                        de la bourse en glnlr&amp;l, qui s'oo- oupe plutdt de speculation que de
                        placement.</p>
                    <p>11 faut aussi admettre que le momeut a 6te mal choisi pour le Ian cement de
                        l'affaire. Outre la crise monetaire qui s4vit sur notre place, le marche des
                        valours eat faible et manque d'en- train.</p>
                    <p>Mais les promoteurs n en ont cure. 11s 66 preoccupent peu que la souscription

                        client, contr&amp;irement aux usages suivis jusqu'k ce jour. Ne tenant pas à
                        susciter de l'enthousiasme aux foules,il ne fait miroiter aux yeux du public
                        ni concessions de terraijia^ii dividendes mirobolants. 11 ne fait point de
                        pro- messes. 11 dit simplement, en ce qui conoeme les exploitations

                        aug- menteront de valour se pryenleront!</p>

                        was contained in « bottle of bicarbonate of soda, which she bought
                        originally at Adelaide, in Australia, and got refilled at San Francisco. The

                        Stanford had been very ill physic&amp;Uj and mentally, and was a victim to
                        hallucina tions, the strongest being that her life was in danger. She died
                        at her hotel, after returning from a picnic with her attendants.</p>

                    <p>La commission financière qui fut nominee quelques temps après, en mai 1873,
                        et Composée du marquis do Baurogard, du chev. P. L. Dilberoglu et du
                        professeur F. F. Oddi, trouva que les frais de l'ordre s'étaieut élovéa dans
                        ce court espace de temps à 146.206 francs, tandis que les encaissements
                        avaient été de 1889 francà seulement pour la même période. C'était donc un
                        déficit de 144,317 francs.</p>
                    <p>Or cette somme de 144.317 lrancsavait été avancée par M. Zola dont l'ordre
                        restait par conséquent le débiteur. En déduisaut do cette somme une partie
                        dont il fit abandon à l'ordre, il restait créancier pour la somme de 118.543
                        francs.</p>
                    <p>L'assemblée extraordinaire à laquelle le rapport financier de la Commission
                        fut soumis manifesta toute sa gratitude pour la donation de son président.
                        Des adresses aflluèreut rédigées dans les termes les plus flatteurs. C'était
                        de l'admiration, de l'enthousiasme.</p>
                    <p>Il s'agissait de payer le solde de la créance. Le Grand Orient qui n'avait
                        encaissé en 4 ans que la somme de 1,889 francs 50 centimes se tronvait dans
                        l'iinpoa^ibilité dele faire. Dans 1 intérêt de M* Zola et pour l'honneur de
                        l'ordre, la Commission Financière proposa.de faire un prêt pour la somme de
                        130,000 francs an moyen d'une émission d'une quantité d'obligations,
                        amortissables en 14 ans, avec intérêt de 12 % l'an (intérêt légal à cette
                        époque). Cette proposition lut adoptée par l'A«semblée Générale. Ces
                        obligations au nombre do 1,450 émises le 5 mai 1878 furent consignées à M.
                        Zola et devaient être payées à l'expiration des 14 ans, intérêt et
                        capital.</p>
                    <p>Mais qu'arrive-t-il ? En 1879 la Grande Loge, qui compose l'Assemblée
                        Générale du Grand Orient, se sépare du Grand Orient et se constitue en corps
                        indépendant sous la dénomination "Grande Loge Nationale d'Egypte". En se
                        séparant elle prend à sa charge uue partie dq la dette,soit 905 obligations.
                        Mais le 23 avril 1891, M. Zola se voit acculé à une transaction avec la
                        Grande Loge et obligé d'accepter en échange de ces 905 obligations, qui
                        représentaient à cette époque, en capital et intérêts, la somme de 242,540
                        francs, uue bagatelle de 31,096 fronts, moyennant laquelle il devait
                        renoncer à toute réclamation ultérieure.</p>
                    <p>Restait h encaisser les autres 640 obligations. En 1901 M. Zola se résout h
                        en réclamer le paétfnent du Suprême Conseil qui s'était engagé à les lui
                        payer. Le tribunal auquel il dut en référer, rejeta sa demande et la Cpur
                        confirma ee premier jugement par son arrêt du 1er avril 1902.</p>
                    <p>Aujourd'hui M. Zola fait de nouveau appel et réclame pour ses 640 obligations
                        74,413 francs de capital, et 135,040 fraucs d'intérêts. 11 prouve
                        1'exiBteuce d'un seul Grand Orient au moment où la dette fut contractée et
                        dit que l'existence simultanée de deux Grand Orient en Egypte n'a été
                        imagiuée par l'adversaire que pour arriver à établir qu'il avait été
                        intégralement payé de sa créance. C'est à tort a/oate-t-il, qu'on voudrait
                        aujourd'hui lui opposer la chose jugée eu ce qui concerne le Suprême Couseil
                        des 33 rite écossais, ancien et acoepté, qui, selon l'arrêt, serait
                        d'origine espagnole et qui n'a eu naissance qu'eu 1876 seulement, à savoir
                        postérieurement à la nais- sanoe de sa créance. Il avait cru ce Suprême
                        Couseil valablement engagé par le fait de son président Me Figari. C'est
                        donc à tort que les premiers juges ont déclaré que si le Grand Orient
                        aujourd'hui assigué pouvait être confondu avec la Grande Loge Natiouale
                        d'Egypte, il pourrait opposer au concluant la transaction intervenue le 17
                        mai 1891. Eu effet, les dépens portés en l'Etat déposé sub N 1 avaient été
                        faits par le concluant dans l'intérêt du.Grand Orient d'Egypte dès 1873
                        jusqu'à fin 1875, et il est établi au procès que la Grande Loge du dit Grand
                        Orient ne s'est séparée de celui-ci que bien plus tard, à savoir en 1879,en
                        prenant le nom de Grande Loge Nationale d'Egypte.</p>

                    <p>Le faux Sorcier i>b Tunis</p>
                    <p>Une curieuse affaire vient d'avoir son épi loguc devant le Tribunal
                        Consulaire de Franco à Alexandrie.</p>
                    <p>Au mois de Novembre dernier, plainte fut portée par un courtier à la bourse
                        de notre ville, contre un Tunisien, sujet local, Hadji el Arbi ben Aly el
                        Gharbi pour une escroquerie qui aurait été commise dans des conditions
                        impliquant une grande naïveté de la part de la victime.</p>
                    <p>D'après le récit du plaignant, des amis l'avaient engagé à consulter au sujet
                        d'une maladie dont souffrait depuis longtemps sa * fillette, sans que les
                        médecins parvinssent à la souUQtfj le (rtêveno, arrivé récemment de Tüùie
                        âVeo une grande réputation de sorcier et <cb n="2"/>magicien.</p>
                    <p>Hadji el Arbi beu Aly-el-Gharbi se montra digne de sa haute réputation.</p>
                    <p>11 remit au coùïtièr Une petite boîte contenant une poudre magique et
                        prononça quelques paroles mystérieuses. La fillette ayant pris la poudre
                        guérit aussitôt sans avoir même vu son guérisseur.</p>
                    <p>Cette cure miraculeuse inspira au père une grande confiance dans le pouvoir
                        occuhe du sorcier tunisien, de sorte qu'il le consulta but le moyen de faire
                        rapidement fortune.</p>
                    <p>Le sorcier ne lui donna pas de tuyau sor la National Bank ou la Darru San it
                        h tuais il l'engagea à 1m apporter une somme en livres d'or, aussi to rtc
                        que possible.</p>
                    <p>Dans sa candeur, le courtier aurait remis 102 livres au magicien qui les
                        palpa, les mit en rouleaux et les plaça dans un coffret, tout en proférant
                        des incantations.</p>
                    <p>Puis il invita le courtier à fermer le coffret à clef, et à l'emporter chez
                        lui et à ne l'ouvrir qu'aprèâ un délai de onze jours, nécessaire jpour que
                        les formules magiques pussent produire tout leur effet Alors sa fortune
                        serait faite.</p>
                    <p>Pour sa rémunération, le sorcier se fit signer par le courtier un billet à
                        ordre du montant de 70 francs.</p>
                    <p>Dans son impatience, le courrier ne put pas attendre l'espaco fatidique de
                        onze jours prescrits.</p>
                    <p>Vingt quatre heures après l'audience que lui avait accordée le magicien, il
                        ouvrit le ooffret pour voir si l'effet des incantations ne commençait pas à
                        se produire. Il trouva que l'effet était eutièremeut réalisé puisque les
                        livres en or avaieut disparu et étaient remplacées par dos piles de
                        vulgaires piastres courantes.</p>
                    <p>Dans sou juste ressentiment, le courtier s'adressa aux autorités consulaires
                        françaises qui envoyèrent Hadji el Arbi beu Aly el Gharbi en prison. .</p>
                    <p>Cette affaire de sorcellerie est venue la semaine dernière devant le Tribunal
                        Consulaire de France qui lui a consacré deux longues audieuces. 4</p>
                    <p>Le prévenu, un bel homme, à la figure sympathique et de superbe prestance
                        s'est défendu avec éaergie de l'accusation)^ portée contre lui. Sans aucuue
                        difficulté, il a reconnu s'occuper de médeciue et de cabale pour son
                        agrémeut personnel, tnais a déclaré n'avoir jamais fait le métier de diseur
                        de bonue aventure.</p>
                    <p>Par une habile contre attaque il a représenté le plaignant comme un vulgaire
                        filou qui u'avait jamais possédé 102livres, ui même moins, et qui cherchait
                        à s enrichir aux dépens du prévenu.</p>
                    <p>Après avoir euteudu 25 témoins tant à charge qu'à décharge et uue brillante
                        plaidoirie de Me Achille de la Pommeraye eu faveur de l'accusé, le Tribunal
                        a acquitté Hadji el Arbi ben Aly el Gharbi, estimaut que la préveution
                        u'était pas établie.</p>
                    <p>Avec uue-graude courtoisie ot beaucoup de dignité, le faux-sorcier de Tunis a
                        remercié le Tribunal et son avocat, eu proclamant de nouveau son
                        innocence.</p>

                    <p>The trade in Egyptian yarns continues very unsatisfactor, and there being no
                        indeucemtn for spinners to buy more cotton than for their immediate
                        requirements, prices are irregular at unchanged rates.</p>
                    <p>Futures have been fairly active this week, and the following represent the
                        latest values.</p>
                    <p>March 6.44 May 6.31 July 6.25</p>
                    <p>April 6.37 June 6.29 Aug 6.24 Nov. 6.13</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">American Futures</hi>. The market this week has been less
                        active, but there have been frequent fluctuations. To-day's closing values
                        are 7 @ 6 points lower than those of last Thursday, the distant positions
                        have declined the most. There is no new feature, there is an absensce of
                        speculative interest, and the Market is almost entirely in the hands of
                        professional traders. Better weather in the Cotton area has casued sligjtly
                        increased crop movements, but so far planters do not show signs of selling
                        more freely and the preparations for planing the next crop are very
                        backward. The condition and tone of the market reflect the general absence
                        of any decidied opinion, no one seems to know whether to buy or to sell is
                        better, and so most people decide for the moment, at any rate, to look
                        on.</p>

                        lorwometwo or three years. That development work was then confined to the
                        Oui Nuoauli mine, where they had succeeded in discovering reefs ul very
                        great promise, and they mentioned that the operations were passing beyond
                        the prospecting stage, a\id that the time was arriving when the necessary
                        capital ahould be provided fur equipping the mine, and lor its mure extended
                        exploration, both laterally and in depth. Their scheme having becu mu* lured
                        they, parly in June last, caused to v registered the Sudan Cold Field,
                        Limited, with*a capital of £300,000, divided into *,000 shaics of £1 each,

                    <p>With regard to the concession held in Egypt, that has not been up to the
                        present so proa mining as the cue in the Euduu. They have, however,
                        discovered upon it several reels, some i>i which have developed lairly
                        extensively— viz., at iiamesh and bamut. Culortuuately, howeveri at those
                        centres, whilst the reefs have been aunlerous and sometimes of considerable
                        promise, they have so far tailed to prove ol a pay able value. Recently they
                        have been concentrating their attention upon Dun gash and iLriahme, where
                        old workings are fiiso found, and at the former tirtj prospects are at
                        present most encouraging. The deepest level now 1U3 It. from surface, and
                        some samples recently received from their superintendent m Kjypl, Mr.
                        Donnai, taken from this level, have ' ecu tested in London, with most
                        favorable results, the assay values ranging from 7 dwts iip^p 3 uzs 3 dwtsol
                        gold per ton. They are to ixmtinuu to opuu up the Dungash mine, and with
                        that view are now sinking the No. 3 shaft [or a further level in depth. At
                        Barrahine they have nut yet done much work, but they are very hopeful that
                        both at Dungash and Barrahine they muy succeed in opening up profitable
                        reefs.in their report the directors have referred it some length to the new
                        concession in the Berber district which was granted to them some little time
                        agu by the «Sudan Government. Over Uiia property, which comprises some
                        15,000 square miles, they hold directly from the budoii Government an
                        exclusive prospecting licence for throe years Hum December 1st, l jul, Mr.
                        Llewellyn made ii preliminary examination*of this area, with be result that
                        it was decided to despatch an expedition to the property to investigate
                        close- iy some ol the old woikings,which he had met xith. That expedition
                        arrived on the property in December last, and work is now being arried on at
                        two centres—Negem and Hasliim At Negem they have exceedingly good prospects.
                        At Hasliim they have numerous reels, which, however, at suiface appear to be
                        of low ijrude. The most promising of the reefs will lie tested by putting
                        down trial pits upon them, and we hope that we may tiud them more productive
                        as we get below the surface. The Suakin Mining Syndicate, in which this
                        syndicate holds 5,IKK) partly-paid</p>
                    <p>diares and 1,250 fully-paid shares, has pros peeling rights over a large
                        concession in the Suakiu district of the Sudan. The considerable interests
                        which this syndicate holds in Egypt ind the Sudan, and tho large amount of
                        capital it has been successful in introducing for the exploration of its
                        properties, have caused the directors to be approached with Hers of further
                        concessions. In connection with two of the properties recently brought to
                        their notice, they were able to arrange for the necessary time lor their
                        cursory examina tiou, and they at once despatched an engineer selected by
                        the managers, Messrs,. John Taylor and Sons, to make such examination on the
                        spot Should the engineer's report be favor able, the di ts wJJ theu
                        endeavour to form a syudicat-» ^whose capital they would probably

                        these areas, and to undertake prospecting operations, with the view to the
                        flotation of a company in the future, in the eveut of the reefs proving of a
                        payable character, in connection with the other area, which has to some
                        extent already been developed, should the preliminary investi gation lead
                        the directors to regard it as a sufficiently promising mining venture, they
                        would within the next twelve months use their best endeavours to f rrn a
                        company to take it over. Aiter going through theaccounts theCbaiiman
                        concluded by sayipg : "We came to the conclu Sion tliat we could pay a
                        dividend at the rate of 100 per cent., and that the cash received, together

                        <p>RELIGION IN THE SCHOOLS</p>
                        <p>To the editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." </p>
                        <p>Sir, - Will you allow me a space in your columns to bring the notice of
                            the authorities of our country the great inconvenience and annoyance
                            arising from the reply of the Education department sent to the
                            Legislative Council on the question of teaching the Islam faith and
                            religion in public schools. THe ministry of Public Instruction says
                            "that owing to the numerous subjects that to be taught in the Government
                            schools, it is hardly possible to find the time of teaching same." Such
                            being the case I consider that no such trifiling reason should be a
                            hindrance to the carrying out of the wishes of Legislative Counscil. </p>
                        <p>Religion being, as everyone understands a defence agsinst evil passions,
                            the path of righteousness in this world and the means of our being
                            numbered among the pure and innocent in the social life, it is very
                            necessary for us to highly train spirited and noble youths who will
                            shortly remove from school and be introduced to the world. Let me say
                            with the deepest regret that Egyptians now-a-days, especially those
                            Muslems young school-fellows, do not carea a bit for attending prayers,
                            even to acquire a slight knowledge of the fundamental principles of
                            their religion, not to endeavor themsleves to hear a preacher at one of
                            our Friday Prayers ; our social will be ruined in the cursh and vanities
                            of the fashionable world.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I beg to draw the critical eyes of our esteemed authorities
                            ot the following suggestions and hope my bullet will not miss its mark.
                            Rligion may be taught to all the scholars of the Government schools in a
                            sample gallery of the premises, the pupils standing in an 'attention'
                            manner, and the heads of the schools, or any of the noble and
                            well-qualified staff, giving a lecture and reading a chapter of the
                            Koran with a simple explaination. This service may be held daily in the
                            morning for 30 minutes. In carrying out scuh a scheme through all
                            schools we combine two desired objects, viz. keeping time, and seeking
                            the welfare of schoolboys, byimparting the knowledge of God offered in
                            the Koran. I hope this matter may be discussed by our papers.- I am.

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Sir, - In common with many of my fellow-citizens, I am curious to know
                            what is the society which is styled in the article of to-day in the
                            "Gazette". The S.P.C.A in Egypt." Like the author of this article, "we
                            therefore venture to appea to our vistiors to remember that there are
                            other places in Egypt besides Ccairo, Luxor, and Assouan," and we
                            venture, at the same time, to remind him of what he has evidently
                            alloewd to escape hisobservation of his memory, viz. : that there is not
                            only a sea-coast village called Alexandria, but that there is another S.
                            P. C. A., in that locality, of elecen years standing, with an equal, if
                            not superior, claim to the proud title assumed in the article; and that,
                            like the S.P.C.A., 'having done great things in a limited area and with
                            limited resources, it needs to help to enable it to continue and to
                            extend its work." Unfortunately, this S.P.C.A not havnig its
                            headquarters in the Metropolis where hotels, crowded for three months in
                            the year with wealthy tourists, afford a ready means of obtaining
                            pecuniary assistance, is necessarily supported entirely by contributions
                            from the local residents. </p>

                    <p>The C. M. Intelligencer says ; — "Lord Cromer, and the Sirdar at Khartoum (
                        Sir Reginald Wingate), while they have felt compelled to restrict the
                        society's plans for communicating the Gospel message to the Mohamedans, have
                        always expressed their desire to see missions established among the Pagan
                        tribes of the Upper Nile about which there need be no scruple. They have
                        approved of tho American Presbyterians going up to the Sobat River, whore an
                        excellent Industrial mission has been started ; and of the Austrian Roman
                        Catholics going south-west to the territory of the Bahr-el-Ghazal. And more
                        than two years Ago Lord Cromer expressed the satisfaction it would Afford
                        him if a British misrion also coiild occupy some part of those immense
                        territories. Lord Cromer has renewed his request, and the society is
                        entering with great hopefulness on this new field of operation." "This,"
                        says the C. M. Intelligencer, 'Ha no doubt the most important opening for
                        the society's effort since Mr. Stanley's effort for Uganda in 1875,"</p>

                    <p>The following is the text of the Railway commision's note on the engineering
                        department: -</p>
                    <p>The organisation of this department is not established on a convenient or
                        economical basis, and the proposed expenditure of large sums of money points
                        to the necessity of putting it on a sounder footing as soon as possible. It
                        is believed that thestaff is capable of considerable reduction, though the
                        employment of extra assistance may be needful for a time. Such reduction cau
                        well be effected by reducing the amount of unnecessary correspondence that
                        now takes place, and by the employment of contractors or piece workers to a
                        considerable extent in place of day labour. On the occasion of this in-'pec
                        iuu some inconvenience has been caused by the absence of plans and estimates
                        for the different projects to be considered. It is highly desirable that in
                        every case possible, a plau and estimate should be prepared in conjunction
                        with other departments concerned, and it is only by attention to such points
                        that economy and efficiency can be secured.</p>

                    <p>SAINT ANDREW'S FOOTBALL CLUB, c. R. BERKS* SIGNALLERS.</p>
                    <p>This match was played on the ground of the former at Moharrem Bey on Saturday
                        last under ideal weather conditions. The home team won the toss, and Gleed
                        started the game for the visitors. Gough and Jones took possession
                        immediately, and a combined run by the whole front liue brought the Saints
                        iu front of Quartennan, whom Partridge beat, when tho game was only a minute
                        old. Two minutes later the same player, agjriu aided by beautiful
                        combination on the part of the forwards and half backs coinbiued,repeated
                        this performance, and thus the homo team stood two goals up. The visitors
                        now settled down, and Huut and Borner transferred play to Curtis's end, but
                        the home custodian was all there. On several occasions Dovey and lumau
                        looked dangerous, but their shooting was a little off. Both teams were now
                        having a fair Bbare of the play, and both keepers were tested in turn, but
                        up to the interval no lurther scoring took place. »</p>
                    <p>On resuming the Signallers forced matters, and Berner looked like getting
                        through, but Hopkins, who was plaj ing a hue game, cleared in masterly
                        fashion. Still the visitors pressed, and success at last came their way,
                        Dovey scoring from well out. The visitors were now having most of the play,
                        but Keill and Hop- kius were playing a safe game, and the attempts of the
                        forwards to find the net were repeatedly foiled. The JSaints got away, on
                        jibe right, but Austin cleared, and later Jones tested Quartennan with a.
                        smart shot. Partridge had a nice opening but Keen anticipated. Time arrived
                        with Saint Andrew's pressing. Full time score: Saint Andrew's 2, Signalleis

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. They are as
                        follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE I. SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                    <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to Palermo and
                        down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and Catania. TAORMINA is one of
                        the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station
                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman

                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE II. NORTHERN ITALY. Italian Lakes Italian &amp; French
                        Riviera</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                        and Staubbach in the Valley of Lauterbrunnen. Then also the glaciers of
                        Grindelwald and views from Murren and the Schynige Platte are sights not to

                        railway.</p>
                    <p>MURREN is celebrated for the finest view of Alpine scenery to be had from any
                        residential spot. The ascent of the Schilthorn can be made from here in
                        about 4 hours.</p>

                    <p>Brienz, at the north end of Lake Brienz, noted for wood carving, is worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>LAUSANNE itself is a mile-and-a-half from the shore of the lake up in the
                        centre of the Jorat Hills. The port for landing from the steamer is Ouchy,
                        roughly 30 miles from Geneva. The old and new parts of Lausanne are joined
                        by a very fine bridge 135 yards long, called the Grand Pont, or sometimes
                        Pont Pichard after the builder. The cathedral dates from the 13th century,
                        and is a fine gothic edifice, the approach to the terrace of the cathedral
                        is by 160 steps, or by a winding street, but the views are very fine from
                        the terrace. Other interesting places are the cantonal museum, Musee
                        Aarlaud, blind asylum, etc. Leaving Ouchy by steamer you come to Pully,
                        Cully, then Vevey, famous as the scene of Rousseau's romance Nouvelle
                        Heloise. Here also are important factories for tobacco, chocolate and
                        infants food. </p>
                    <p>MONTREUX is composed of scattered villages partly on the hillside, partly on
                        the late, and is divided into three parts, Le Chatelard, Les Planches, and
                        Veytaux. Many excursions can be made from Montreux; to Vevey by electric

                        surrounding mountains can be obtained, then to Naye, 6,500 feet, from where
                        can be seen the Bernese Alps (Wetterhorn, Eiger, Jungfrau, etc.) Les Avants
                        can be reached from Montreux by road, via Glion, and the fields of narcissus
                        are a lovely sight in early summer.</p>
                    <p>Continuing on by rail, you pass Territet, Villeneuve, Aigle, Bex, St.
                        Maurice, and the come to Martigny.</p>
                    <p>AIGLE, 20 minutes from Montreux is the starting point to the health resorts
                        of Leysin, Diablerets, Chateau d'Oex (for its bracing mountain air cures);
                        Villars (for milk cures, and lovely scenery); Chesieres and Bex (noted for
                        its strong saline waters and grape cures). Near Bex is Les Plans for
                        climatic cure, 3,600 ft., and a centre for mountain excursions.</p>
                    <p>Martigny is the starting place for the Tete Noir and Col-de-Balme routes to
                        Chamonix, one of the most popular Alpine resorts, on account of being within
                        easy reach of the famous Mer-de-Glace Clacier des Bossons. The ascent of
                        Mont Blanc is made from here, and needs usually two days.</p>
                    <p>Champery, situated at the foot of the Dent-du-Midi, is reached by diligence
                        from Monthey. From Martigny the railway goes to Brigue (the terminus of the
                        Simplon and Furka routes) via Sion (starting point for Evolena, Arolla,

                        made. The view of the snow-covered Alps and glaciers obtained from the
                        railway to Gornergrat is really magnificent.</p>
                    <p>Eggshorn is a high mountain resort on the Brigue-Rhone Glacier road, whence
                        the ascent of the Jungfrau is made quite easily. There are also numerous
                        Glacier excursions, notably that to the Aletsch Glacier the largest in

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
