                        <p>The weather has now settled down to wintry conditions. Yesterday was
                            again dull and cheerless. During the night a light gale sprangip from
                            the S.W., and continues till this morning, the wind being intensley
                            cold. The barometer is steady. Today promises to be dull and cold, and
                            some rain may fall.</p>

                    <head>THE HELLENIC CASE </head>
                    <p>M. Athos Romanos, the well-known Greek politician and ex-Minister for Foreign
                        Affairs in the previous Theotokis Cabinet, has just published a well-written
                        pamphlet on the persecution of his countrymen by the Bulgarians. As the
                        Greeks are being continually censured for their conduct to the Bulgarians in
                        Macedonia, it is only fair that it should be realised that there is another
                        side of the question.</p>
                    <p>M. Romanos has wisely accompanied his statements with photographs showing the
                        havoc wrought by the Bulgarians in the Greek Club and the Greek School at
                        Philippopolis, the latter founded by M. Maraslis, of Odense, the well-known
                        Greek philanthropist and patriot, and the almost complete destruction of the
                        Hellenic quarter of Anchialos, on the Black Sen. It is noticeable, as one of
                        these photographs demonstrates, that the conflagration, which destroyed nine
                        hundred Greek houses and shops, stopped, as if by miracle, before the walls
                        of the Bulgarian Church - miracle worthy of the Middle Ages, which was
                        doubtless intended to point the moral that walvation of | life and property
                        is to be found by those who follow the Bulgarian Exarch rather than by the
                        adherents of the Ecumenical Patriarch. The Bulgarians say that the fault lay
                        with the Greeks, who provoked reprisals by their resistance. It would have
                        been greatly to the discredit of the latter if they had not done so.
                        Anchialos contained six thousand Greeks, and when they saw one of their
                        compatriots fall, pierced by a Bulgarian bullet, they naturally fired on his
                        murderers. Not having many weapons they could not beat off the Bulgarian
                        bands, and the fire ere long rendered further resistance impossible,</p>
                    <p>M. Romanos complains bitterly that the Bulgarian Government has not restored
                        to his fellow-countrymen their churches and schools. The Bulgarian lion, he
                        wys waves over the Marasli school at Philippopolis, which has been
                        proclaimed State property, and no less than sixty-six Greek schools,
                        formerly attended by eight thousand pupils, have been closed by the
                        application of a clause in the Bulgarian Education Act of 1891 which has
                        hitherto been a dead letter. M. Romanos points out that this action
                        constitutes an infringement of the religious liberty guaranteed to the
                        Greeks of Bulgaria by the Berlin Treaty and by the Organic Statute of
                        Eastern Rumelia (now South Bulgaria). He might have added, that complete
                        religious toleration exists in Greece, whether the creed concerned be that
                        of the Roman Catholics of the Cyclades and the Ionian Islands or that of the
                        few Mussulmans who have remained in Thessaly since its retrocession to
                        Greece in 1898. The very first Article of the Greek Constitution, while
                        forbidding proselytism, guarantees complete religious liberty, and this is
                        not a mere rhetorical flourish of the Parliamentary draughtsman, but fact
                        The State subsidies the Turkish muftis of Thessaly, and Roman Catholics and
                        Jews have their own religious instruction in the public elementary
                        schools.</p>
                    <p>It is no doubt, unfortunate that the Eastern Christians should hate each
                        other so cordially, but they have always done so, and in that res peet they
                        differ only in degree from the more civilised Western Christians Europe,
                        however, is entitled to know that the fault is not all on one side and that
                        all Bulgarians are not angels and all Greeks are not the opposite. Finlay,
                        himself • Philhellene, could laugh during the War of Independence at the
                        extravagances of Philhellenism. But people are now in danger of going to the
                        opposite extreme that of thinking that the Greeks can do nothing right
                        because they have, like even the youngest of us, made some mistakes.</p>

                    <p>ENGLISH RESIDENTS INTREPIDITY</p>
                    <p>Very important seizures of hashish were made at Ramleh on Monday and
                        yesterday, which illustrate in a remarkable manner how adept the servants of
                        some of the most respectable fans in Berkeley are in running bashish. The
                        house of Mr. HC. Parkinson, the general manager of the Khedivial Mail
                        Steamship Company, is right on the lift at Berkeley, and is protected from
                        the inroads of the seas by an almost perpendicular sea wall. Access to the
                        house from the beach is obtained by some steps on the wall. The Coastguard
                        Administration's patrol cannot get to the coast at this point as the
                        approaches to the East and West are cloned by two walls to the end of the
                        cliff.</p>
                    <p>Early on Monday morning, at about 1 o'clock, Mr. Parkinson was aroused from
                        his slumbers by peculiar thudding noise. He went round the house and was
                        surprised to find light in his kitchen. He entered and found his suffrage
                        engaged in making tea. The suffrage said that it was bad to be out, and,
                        feeling cold, thought he would make some tea. This explanation did not,
                        however, not count for the strange noise, so Mr. Parkinson ordered the man
                        to go out and see if anybody was moving about in the er d'osure. The man
                        went off and came back soon afterwards declaring that he could not find a
                        soul outside, and that all was quiet.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Parkinson then went to bed again, but soon afterwards he again heard the
                        mysterious thud, thud, thud, jost outside his house. Rounded with people
                        walking in the yard of his horse dragging huge weights with them, and they
                        distinctly noted the footfalls. He determined to probe the mystery to its
                        depths and, arming himself with a loaded revolver, he went himself to
                        ascertain the truth. It was pitch dark night, and nothing could be
                        distinguished. Batas be was moving round and nearly stumbled over a big
                        sack. He at once goers what game was being played and recognised that
                        hasbieb was being landed. He went to his telephone and rang the Coast guard
                        station at Ramelb, which is only about five hundred metres off. Help was at
                        once sent and eighteen sacks of bashish were found round about the
                        enclosure. One of the sacks was brought to light hidden in the room of Mr.
                        Parkinson's suffragette.</p>
                    <p>The importance of this seizure may be recognised when it is known that the
                        selling price of such an amount of hashish would be between L.E. 4,500 and
                        L.E. 5,000, for the sacks contained twelve hundred kilo over a ton's

                    <p>The suffrage was handed over by Mr. Parkinson to the Coast Guard, who took
                        him into custody. Evidently the sacks of hashish had been floated in from a
                        boat lying in the offing, as it is impossible to eftaota landing there
                        except on moonlight night. The smugglers must have been very somerous as it
                        would require at least ten men to marry off seob a large haal. When Mr.
                        Parkinson was ringing up the telephone to the Coast Guard he heard the sound
                        of the whole carriage driving rapidly away. This no doubt contained some of
                        the smugglers.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, when the coast guard were taking the suffrage to the Customs
                        Administration Commission in order to be brought to trial, he said that he
                        had some news to tell them, and he volunteered the information that if they
                        I would look in the stable of the house adjoining Mr. Parkinson's, which is
                        inhabited by Mr. Borohgrevink, the Procureur General of the Mixed Tribunals,
                        they would find another tres tre trove of ashish. Subsequently, on a search
                        being made, tourteen sacks were found hidden under the tibia in Mri.
                        Borchgrevink's stable. His native coachman, who has been Gitteen years in
                        his service, is about to be taken into custody. Both be and Mr. Parkinson's
                        suffrage were most respectable servants. The latter was in the service of
                        Major Mackenzie Pendrell for some time. Evidently the servants in houses by
                        the sea at Ramleh are corrupted by the smugglers, who are quite able to
                        offer Snormons bribes of hundreds of pounds for 9-operation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Parkinson and his next-door neighbour, Mr. C.A.H. Alderson, have now
                        given the Coast Guard Administration permission to station a guard within
                        their enclosures, as this part of the coast is evidently convenient pace for
                        running hashish I To show how carefully laid were the sung Iglars plans on
                        this occasion, we must mention that Mr. Parkinson on Sunday night did not
                        notice his fax terrier and only saw it again at about 7 o'clock next
                        morning, when it oame home collarless and lame. It had been removed the day
                        before and tied up some way off. flag the dog been in the bonae, it would
                        have at once given the salary,</p>
                    <p>Two hours after the discovery of the hashish "the Coastguards in the Eastern

                    <p>It is understood that the bashish found at Bulkeley was brought over from

                        doubt that this great se zute of £5,000 worth of ba hsh is entirely due to
                        the plook of Mr. Parkinson, who ventured out alone at a time when there must

                    <p>Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P. paid visit to the Alexandria Museum yesterday. He
                        was very pleased with the progress that the Museum is making and expressed
                        his satisfaction to Professor Breccia, the curator of the Museum. H.
                        displayed keen interest in many of the srebæological tronenres which be
                        noticed. Professor Brescis personally sendast od Mr. Robertson over the
                        building and we thanked that gentleman for his attention.</p>

                    <p>We now deal with Mr. John Robertson, M.P. He has clothed himself in the cast

                        become the friend of our enthusiasts and their saviour from the laws of the

                        hoisting his flag on the banks of the Nile he would have only foord semis.

                        capitulated.</p>
                    <p>We remarked that Robertson is the friend of certain enthusiasts; be has left

                        forgot us all, and has apparently also forgotten his own past policy. We may
                        add that he was always in pain to help himself to all that came his way. One

                        end of Act II. in most spirited. This was indeed a number which might well
                        have been ignored rather than the somewhat sugary cereal flight of Silfide

                    <p>The dance given last night by the members of the Khedivial Club was a very
                        great success. Notwithstanding the bad weather that prevailed there were 400
                        guests present. It is needless to say that the olav's preemies looked their
                        best, profusely decorated as they were with the choicest plants and
                        brilliantly lit op with altitude of electrie lampe. By eleven o'clock the
                        large reading room, which is used as a ball-room, was full, and doing bad
                        began. The scene presented was charming in the extreme. The ladies were most
                        bands only be owned, the light colours of their beautiful tulettes
                        contracting with the dark green opi form of the 60tbR flash and the red
                        costs of the Dublin Fusiliers, the officers of both their regiments being
                        present in fall foron. It is quite impossible to give the names of thore
                        present ; but we noticed H. B. the Governor of Alexandria, the officers of
                        the Army of Occupation, the Consular Cerpe, judges, Government officials,
                        and the elite of the English and foreign society.</p>
                    <p>A most excellent rapper, for which the elub is renowned, was served to over
                        10 guests, after which the cotillon began. Mrs. Rees and Miss Holland,
                        assisted by Mr. Sidney Wilkio. son and Mr. Reer, led this dance, and it was
                        due to their efforts that it proved huge Success. The presents given away
                        were profese, and in some cases of a very rich nature. The greatest prison
                        is due to the ladies we have mentioned, who took the atmoet pains and were
                        indefatigable in their attentions to every great. Such was their agreement
                        that the cotillion, which began at 1 o'clock, did not end until four a.m. </p>
                    <p>Before ending our report of this most successful dance, we must mention that
                        all the members of the club did their best to entertain their guests, and
                        were ably supported by their active secretary.</p>

                        <p>According to telegraphic advice received here, the city of Kingston
                            (Jamaica) has been destroyed by an earthquake. There has been much loss

                        <p>Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, stood on the north side of a
                            land-locked harbour, the boat in the island, and, for its size, one of
                            the best in the world. Its population was about 48,000. It was founded
                            in 1693-1703, after the Neighbouring town of Port Royal had been
                            destroyed by an earthquake. From this place, afterwards rebuilt,
                            Kingston was a distant 6 miles, the breadth of its noble heaven ; while
                            with Spanish Town, towards the interior, it has since 1846 been
                            connected by railway. In 1768 Spanish Town was made the capital, but in
                            1872 the seat of Government was removed to Kingston. Kingston was
                            visited in 1880 by a violent hurricane, and by a vast configuration in
                            December 1892, as also before in 1782 and 1848. The most interesting

                    <head>CAPE TO CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>A LADY'S JOURNEY</p>
                    <p>Rarely has the theatre at Barlington-gardens been more crowded than it was
                        the other afternoon, when Miss Mary Hall delivered a Christmas lecture to
                        the members of the Royal Geographical Society by describing "A Lady's
                        Journey from the Cape to Cairo." The president, Sir George Tanbman Goldie,
                        occupied the chair, and in introducing the lecturer explained that she had
                        traversed the African Continent in its entire length from south to north.
                        From the Cape to the Zambesi in the first place, and from Khartoum to Cairo
                        in the second place, Miss Hall came within the limits of what might be
                        called present-day civilization. Between the Zambebi and Khartoum was the
                        more adventurous part of Africa, and, knowing what Miss Hall had
                        accomplished, he could assert that he had performed a journey of a
                        remarkable character, and one requiring an extraordinary exhibition of
                        courage and capacity, endurance and energy, and, above all, management and
                        tact. Alone and unprotected, she travelled 4,000 miles without a serious
                        bitch. Miss Hall then told the story of her Journey in language well within
                        the comprehension of her audience, a majority of whom were children, who
                        were simply delighted with the snapshots by which the lecture was liberally
                        illustrated. When the natives at Lake Nyanga heard that she was "not
                        married," and had "merely come for a walk," they were amazed and thought
                        "she must be a lunatic." She visited Ujiji, the place where Livingstone
                        labored, and took a photograph of the stone erected to the memory of the
                        great missionary's wife. It was at Ujij: that Stanley met "Dr. Livingstone,
                        I believe ?" At Victoria Nyanza Miss Hall was the first white woman the
                        natives had ever seen in European dress. At Movenga she made a short stay
                        with Bishop Tacker, and caught the young King of Uganda in the thick of a
                        football match. His Majesty was dressed in an appropriate athletic costume,
                        and spoke very fair English. A snapshot was shown of Fashoda, the scene of
                        the celebrated interview between General Kitchener and Colonel Marchand. "My
                        last picture," remarked Miss Hill, is a photograph of the magnificent palace
                        at Khartoum, which has been erected over the site of the former and less
                        assuming residence of the great soldier, General Gordon." At the instance of
                        Sir George Taubman Goldie, thanks were voted to Miss Hall by
                        acclamation.</p>

                    <p>ENGLISH V. FRENCH.</p>
                    <p>LONDON MANUFACTURERS' EMPHATIC REJOINDER.</p>
                    <p>The statement recently appearing in the Journal of the British Chamber of
                        Commerce of Egypt to the effect that French carriages are superior to those
                        made in Great Britain has been promptly challenged by leading carriage
                        builders in London.</p>
                    <p>Speaking from an experience of more than 40 years, Mr. William Thorp, of the
                        firm of W. and P. Thorn, of Great Portland St., told the "Standard"
                        representative :</p>
                    <p>"Such a statement amounts to nonsense. The English carriage is far better
                        built, far more serviceable, and of far better value for the money than the
                        French article. It may be a little more expensive, but then you must
                        remember that wages are on a much lower scale in France, and there is no
                        limit to the hours of labour, as in England. Where the French type is
                        different from ours is in the interior elaboration. The French woman is very
                        particular about little fooleries in the way of dainty decorations, and the
                        French carriage builder is bound to study her whims. We could fit up a
                        carriage in every way equal to the French ones, but it would lie on our
                        hands for years before we could sell it to an English customer."</p>
                    <p>Mr. George H. Thrapp, of the firm of Thropp and Maberly, coach builders to
                        the King, waa even more emphatic. "I was," he said, "one of the official
                        judges at the Chicago Exposition of 1893, and have acted in a similar
                        capacity at most English and foreign exhibitions of recent years, and have
                        never yet seen a French-built carriage that could be placed, for intrinsic
                        merit, side by side with an English vehicle of the game shape. I attribute
                        the increasing popularity of French manufactured conveyances in Egypt to the
                        national proclivities of the middleman there. It is, obviously, his duty to
                        encourage French enterprise, but, from a financial point of view, he would
                        meet with equal encouragement from British manufacturers, and, at the same
                        time, give his clients greater satisfaction."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Torapp dealt at length with the subject of the exterior appearance of a
                        carriage. With Mr. Thorn, he agrees that the French upholsterer paid more
                        attention to appearances than claimed that in this respect the Parisian
                        manufacturer has bad natural advantages we do not possess. For instance, he
                        worked in a climate which led itself to the art of varnishing, an art that
                        could never be successfully practised in England. Some years ago a British
                        firm arranged with a French concern to engage some of their varnishers, in
                        order to keep the English system could be improved upon. The men brought
                        their own material and their own tools, but the work they turned out was in
                        no way superior to that executed by English workmen.</p>
                    <p>The manager of the Victoria Carriage Works, in Long-acre, said :-"I think
                        that although in the past the French carriages may have been rather ahead of
                        the English production in the points of luxury and comfort, that superiority
                        no longer exists, as the English manufacturers, for some time past, have
                        recognised that they most excel in this direction as on the point of
                        durability. In my opinion the reason why the French carriage has hitherto
                        been more popular in Egypt is that the French manufacturer has taken more
                        trouble to cultivate the Egyptian market; and it is only quite recently that
                        the English carriage builder has recognised the importance of the Egyptian
                        market for his productions. I am fully convinced that when the English built
                        carriage becomes better known in Egypt it will take the position its
                        intrinsic merit deserves ." </p>
                    <p>It was left to Mr. Ernest, Windower (Messere. C. S. Windover and Co, Limited)
                        to adopt the most optimistic view of the matter. There is absolutely no
                        foundation for the statement," he said. "We are sending more carriages to
                        Egypt and other parts of the world than we have ever done. That (pointing to
                        an elegant Victoria phaeton) is one of the reasons. If you were to ask me to
                        explain this assertion, I would answer that it is a Parisian model, Not that
                        I consider that it is any better than the English model ; but, just in
                        exactly the same way that an English woman takes her fashions in millinery
                        or in robes from Paris, or Berlin, or Vienna, so she can, if she wishes,
                        have her carriage bolstered to her taste. It is, purely and simply, a case
                        of demand and supply. An English firm can build a far more serviceable
                        vehicle than any French manufacturer ; but if it comes to taste, well, that
                        taste has to be met, and we are quite capable of meeting it."</p>
                    <p>It is alleged by the "Journal" that the heavy charges made by English firms
                        for packing and carriage have much to do with the falling-off in trade with
                        England. It is stated that the English average costs in freight from 33 to
                        86 percent on the invoice price, while the French costs only from 13 to 17
                        per cent. To this Mr. Windover replied in terms of emphatic denial. "We can
                        ship," he said, "a carriage from here to Cairo at a cheaper rate than it
                        would cost to get one from Paris to Alexandria. We only charge the prime
                        cost on freight and insurance, and, so far from it costing 33 per cent., I
                        would guarantee to deliver a phaeton in Cairo-- phaeton costing, say, 150
                        guiness - for £15. For the same money I would undertake to land a similar
                        vehicle in Bombay."</p>

                        <p>The winter is, perhaps, unprecedented in the meteorological annals of
                            Syria. So far we have bad, indeed, practically no winter. The
                            thermometer from early December till now, the 9th of January, has been
                            ranging between 17 and 19 degrees Centigrade; and Sapnin, which used to
                            put on its robe of ermine white sometimes at the end of November, looks
                            strangely bare and sad now with its thin streaks of white. This long
                            spell of warm and dry weather in the very middle of the rainy season
                            cannot fail to have serious consequences, and perhaps fatal ones if it
                            is farther protracted. Grain crops may receive no damage if a timely
                            shower, at the beginning and end of spring, comes to refresh the tender
                            plants that require only a superficial watering ; but the trees, whose
                            roots lie deep in the earth, will undoubtedly suffer. So far we have had
                            only about 10 inches of rain, and our normal land necessary rainfall
                            should average 30 or 35 inches. Even if the balance of this average is
                            eventually realized the rain will fall short of the desired effect,
                            coming as it will out of season. The olive crop alternation Syria with a
                            defective and plentiful yield, and this year was to be the plentiful
                            one, but owing to the protracted drought it is feared that it will come
                            much short of sanguine anticipations. lndeed, men of experience, but of
                            a pessimistic turn of mood, dread an invasion of locusts, a plague that
                            usually comes as an aggravation of general evils. </p>

                        <p>The Austrian Lloyd Steam Navigation Company is awakening to the
                            commercial spirit of the age. While retaining in its fundamental form
                            the old régime of "agences de carrière," and thus enjoying while
                            submitting to the Government patronage, the company is trying to develop
                            the commercial side on purely commercial and to a certain extent
                            independent lines. The principal agency at Beyrout, which so far has
                            been an agence de carrière, is to be soon transformed into an agency on
                            the basis of commission, just as that of a company of cargo steamers.
                            The practicability of the English system by which an agent may

                            mainly to the bold initiative of the general manager of the Austrian
                            Lloyd, and to the same power of government in him which led the managing
                            director of the Prince Line to change as representative the very same
                            man who by his honesty, capacity, zeal, and tout has so much contributed
                            to consolidate the position of that line in these waters. I mean Mr.
                            Othon G Tattarachi. In choosing a Greek gentleman for agent the general
                            manager of the Maatrian Lloyd has boldly overruled the prejudice of
                            nationality, which in some quarters is yet insisted upon rather
                            narrowly, regardless of merit. </p>

                        <head>Social Functions,</head>
                        <p>The season's gates were inaugurated by a bright Christmas "reveillon"
                            given to a party of friends at the mansion of Muzaffer Pasba, Governor
                            General of Lebanon. Although there may be some doubts as to their
                            administrative capacity and worth-and I use this collective term for
                            those who can read between the lines-no one can deny that for successful
                            social reception, the Miz offers are not easily surpassed. Cordiality
                            and gracionazes of manner, that is so well calculated to create that
                            homely feeling, and a well ordered generosity, mark their receptions. A
                            rich and dainty cold copper was served followed by a little
                            unconventional dancing, and, at last, thoughtfully chosen souvenirs were
                            distributed amongst the "convives." .</p>
                        <p>Mr. George Covillon, the energetic and intelligent director of the gas
                            works, and his distinguished looking and spirituelle wife invited the
                            same party, and some other friend besides, to a similar evening on
                            Epiphany, It was admittedly the gayest and freest of functions. Most of
                            the French colony were there, and the gracious presence of Sir Robert
                            and Lady Drummond-Hay was a proof of the sincerity and adding character
                            of the entente between the two greatest neighbouring nations, The
                            beautiful house of the Covillons, perched or a projecting cliff, and
                            surrounded by a covered verandah facing the sea, looked, with its
                            profusion of gas lights, particularly charming. Light dancing alterosted
                            with monologues reclaimed by Vice-Conel Mr. F. Wiet, and Dr. Chapo'in,
                            of the French Medical Faculty. Mme Noblet and Mme Dr. Astar looked
                            particularly elegant and pretty amongst the younger set. Mme Noblet
                            recited a monologue with creditable nerve and delicacy of rendering. A
                            copious "diner froid" was served after midnight, and the famous old
                            wines of the Covillons and their good champagne contributed to raise to
                            a pitch the general hilarity.</p>

                        <p>M.P.'S IN EGYPT</p>
                        <p>To the EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." </p>
                        <p>Sir,- In view of the mischievous, policy of some Members of Parliament in
                            regard to Egypt would it not be advisable for us to follow the excellent
                            principle laid down by the Romans in regard to Egypt and forbid all such
                            gentry setting foot in the country. When Egypt was incorporated into the
                            Roman Empire it was most wisely ordained that the Senate as such, as
                            well as every individual of its members, should on no account be allowed
                            to meddle with the affairs of the country. They were catted off from all
                            participation in its government. In fact, senators and persons of
                            senatorial rank were even prohibited from getting foot in this province.
                            The motives which induced Augustus at the very outset of his sole rale
                            to adopt this wise regulation are obvious; and it is worth noting that
                            the arrangement was at no time assailed, for its policy was fully
                            understood. However, although the Capitulations prevent Egypt from
                            making any such law, would it not be feasible for the British Parliament
                            to pass it, for the type of Padgett, M P., is no longer a humorous class
                            of person; he is becoming a menace to the Empire. Sir Siward Grey, who
                            is as good an Imperialist as were his immediate conservative predeces,
                            Lord Lansdowne and Lord Salisbury, might be induced to consider the
                            advisability of some such measure.--I am, etc.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE" |</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,--Fortunately the nature of the average Englishman precludes him
                            from the pastime of throwing bouquets at himself, as I once heard an
                            American designate the set of self-praise. Therefore, on reading the
                            annual report of the Ghirga brand of the above society which appeared in
                            your of the 9th inst., I came to the conclusion it had been supplied by
                            the local hon sec., his name being entirely omitted therefrom.</p>
                        <p>Assuming this to be the case, it is a pleasure: to record an appreciation
                            of the whole-hearted and energetic efforts of Mr. Hartsbourne, the agent
                            of the Agricultural Bank, in that capacity. There must be a quiet
                            satisfaction derived from work of this nature which no self
                            advertisement could enhance. </p>
                        <p>In the report it is declared that the native notables have shown no
                            notice interest in the operation of the society. That they have
                            liberally responded to appeals for financial assistance is evident from
                            the satisfactory balance in hand, which should enable the committee to
                            realize its projects for the future.</p>
                        <p>This is not the only district in which the agents of the Agricultural
                            Bank have identified themselves with the S.P.C.A. More power to
                            them.-Yours faithfully,</p>

                    <head>EDUCATION IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>MR. WELLS'S VIEWS.</p>
                    <p>(FROM THE "MORNING POST"). </p>
                    <p>Mr. Sidney H. Wells, Principal of the Batteries Polytechnic, has undertaken
                        the reorganisation of secondary and technical education in Egypt, and in the
                        course of the next few months that highly successful institution in
                        Battersea Park-road will lose the services of one who since its very
                        beginning 14 years ago next June, has played a great part in its wonderful
                        progress. "We are one of the best known and are doing the biggest work of
                        any such institutions in the country; our income last year was nearly twenty
                        five thousand pounds ; we have enlarged our buildings five times; we are not
                        a penny in debt and we are still growing," remarked Mr. Well to a
                        representative of the "Morning Post". Not only will he leave behind him a
                        splendid work at the Polytechnic, but he is associated with many other
                        spheres of active usefulness. He is a member of the Consultative Committee
                        of the Board of Education, the Teacher Registration Council, the secretary
                        and a member of the Faculty of Engineering of London University, having been
                        one of the original members to be appointed by the University Commissioners,
                        and he is also a member and former secretary of the Board of Studies in
                        Civil and Mechanical Engineering He is a member of the City and Guild
                        Nominations Board as a representative of the Board of Education; a member of
                        the Joint Scholarship Board and former chairman of its intermediate
                        Scholarships Committee; bop. secretary of the Association of Technical
                        institutions, of the Council of which he has been a member for eight years;
                        a member of the Council and Executive of the National Union of Training
                        Schools of Domestic science, and chairman of its Examination, Sub-Committee;
                        and as a representative of the London City Council be in a member of the
                        governing body of the Sir Walter St. John's Schools, Batteries. In addition
                        he is a member of the Council of the Incorporated 'Association of Head
                        Masters, and for the year 1906 was chairman of the London Division of the
                        Association. Naturally the parting of the ways in a case like this will
                        cause many regrets; but, as Mr. Wells said: "am fascinated by the problem in
                        Egypt, by the interest that is taken in the whole question by the people, by
                        the earnest desire of Lord Cromer and other important officials to do their
                        best for the technical education of the natives, and by the enormous
                        problems which around the particular piece of work that lies before one." It
                        was just prior to coming home last summer that Lord Cromer's attention
                        seemed to have been drawn especially to the need for the development of
                        technical education in Egypt, and as the result of consultations with those
                        at home interested in the subject Mr. Wells was asked by Lord Croner and the
                        Egyptian Government if he would come to see what was being done, and present
                        a report and scheme for the whole of the country. Mr. Wells came out in
                        October, and during the three and a half weeks he was here he went
                        everywhere where anything had been done or where anything was contemplated. </p>
                    <p>GENERAL EDUCATION IN VOGUE.</p>
                    <p>Asked for an idea of the impressions he gained, Mr. Wells gave a most
                        interesting review, beginning first with the village schools, which are
                        known as Kuttaks, he said, "are of various grades, from tiny dirty rooms
                        with five or six boy and girls, under a native teacher, learning to read the
                        Koran, up to schools of five rooms with teachers partly trained to take a
                        more regular course. ln the Kuttabs, which are to be found all over the
                        country, the teaching is entirely in Arabic, and the work may be said to be
                        confined to reading, writing, and the elements of arithmetic. Next are what
                        are called the primary schools, which correspond to some extent to our
                        elementary schools, both as regards the aim and scope of the work. Some of
                        the Kuttabs are aided by the Government, but the primary schools are all
                        under Government direction, built and Maintained by the Government, and into
                        the curriculum includes the teaching of English and in some cases French.
                        They Have a four year course, and at the end of it the boys take an
                        examination to obtain what is called a primary school certificate. The
                        course is much like our own, English being thoroughly well taught, also
                        French if desired; science is being introduced and generally the curriculum
                        is a good literary course.Most of the headmasters and many of the staff are
                        English, but in one case at least there is a native headmaster with English
                        assistants. The course is also one of four years, at the end of which time
                        an examination for a farther certificate is passed qualifying for
                        intermediate positions in the Government service or for admission to the
                        higher colleges, of which there are three, all in Cairo-the Polytechnic (the
                        work of which is at present confined to preparing engineers for the
                        Irrigation Service), the School of Medicine, and the School of Law. The
                        staff of the Polytechnic and of the School of Medicine are almost entirely
                        English ; the head of the School of Law is a Frenchman, and there are French
                        professors in the other institutions. There is also a school of Agriculture
                        and Engineering and Technical School of the intermediate grade open to boys
                        who have passed through the primary school."</p>
                    <p>TRADE SCHOOLS. </p>
                    <p>"The chief work in technical education lies in the direction of what we
                        should call trade schools. In Egypt they go under various names, such as
                        model workshops and technical school. They take the boys from the Kattabs
                        and train them to be good craftsmen and artisans. Engineering is the chief
                        industry for which they are prepared ; the building trades come next,
                        especially woodworking. Some do leather work and saddlery, one or two
                        printing and weaving, and one or two conduct departments in musbrabbia and
                        inlaid work. One school, known as the Model Workshops, situated at Boulao, a
                        suburb of Cairo, has 300 pupils, and it is doing excellent work. Then there
                        is the Customs Porters' School at Alexandria, which is now being moved to
                        large new buildings erected by one of the Mohammedan societies interested in
                        education. When completed it will accommodate 450 or 500 boys. At Mansurah
                        there is a school chiefly for wood-working; Assiout, a ten hour railway
                        journey from Cairo, has a model workshop; and, added Mr. Wells, there is a
                        very interesting small technical school still further apart from the country
                        at Abu Tig. This has been founded by one of the wealthy Pashar, who is a
                        Vice President of the Legislative Council, and who has built and maintains
                        the school. It is worked entirely by native teachers, and the trades taught
                        include woodworking, smiths' work, weaving, and inlaid and mushrabia work. A
                        characteristic feature of these trade schools is that they do work for
                        outside orders, charging as far as possible market prices. ""In This way,"
                        remarked Mr. Wells, "they secure a variety of work which would otherwise not
                        be possible. Generally speaking, the lade also receive a certain amount of
                        instruction in continuation of their general education--reading, writing,
                        and arithmetic.--and elementary lessons on the technical side of their
                        trades. This type of school is very largely needed in the Country and the
                        people are much interested in their development. In Beni Suef and Fayoum,
                        two districts in Upper Egypt, the wealthy landowners, at the suggestion of
                        the moudir of the province, have collected over £10,000 for building a
                        technical school and have contributed Land to endow it. With some of the
                        English officials I attended a meeting of these landowners, and I couldn't
                        help noticing how keenly interested they were. A similar scheme is being
                        projected at Damanboor at the suggestion of Prince Haegein. The Coptic
                        Societies have built two technical schools, one a very large building not
                        yet completed, and in addition several of the other European nation cities,
                        the French, the Greeks, and the Italians have their own technical schools;
                        indeed, they have their own general school, primary and secondary, and
                        together with such bodies as the American Mission are doing a great work to
                        help in the education of the native."</p>
                    <p>URGENT NEEDS. </p>
                    <p>"It is in the extension of this type of school that the first development of
                        technical education appears to be called for. Among other things there is
                        need for further instruction in such schools in the building trades,
                        particularly for plumbers and plasterers. The most likely development in
                        this class of institution is a school or schools for the building trades,
                        for electrical work, and for artistic crafts, particularly with a view to
                        developing the native industries of Egypt. There is a call for some training
                        in electrical work in view of the extension of electric lighting in the
                        large towns. This type of intermediate school will further aim at preparing
                        the foremen, clerks of works, draughtsman, designers, etc. , and its
                        students should have been through the primary school, while all its
                        instruction would be in English. I hope that some central institution of
                        that character may be possible in Cairo within the next few years, and as
                        the movement develops possibly in Alexandria as well. With regard to the
                        higher type of technical work, the field at present is somewhat limited.
                        There is an increasing demand for engineers in the Irrigation Service. There
                        is also a need for trained men in the Public Buildings Department and in the
                        Survey Department. My hope is that the Polytechnic may before long develop
                        departments to train men for such work, and that it may also arrange courses
                        for the higher training of mechanical and electrical engineers. It should be
                        pointed out that, as Egypt is essentially an agricultural country depending
                        for its prosperity upon its agricultural products, practically all the
                        technical education in the country arises from agricultural needs. For
                        example, engineers are wanted because pumping machinery, steam engines,
                        steam plough, and other agricultural machinery are now replacing the older
                        methods of manual labor ; wood-workers are wanted because carts are being
                        used for agricultural purposes, and harness is required for the horses. So
                        that really the whole thing depends on the needs of agriculture. It is for
                        this reason that the new Department which has just been formed as the result
                        of one of my recommendations has been termed the Department of Agriculture
                        and Technical Education, following, indeed, the well known example of the
                        department which exists in Ireland."</p>
                    <p>SUGGESTIONS ACCEPTED.</p>
                    <p>"As I said, I was first out there for over three weeks. I saw what was being
                        done and came in contact with many people. But I could not stay to finish my
                        work because of engagements at home. I went out again during the Christmas
                        vacation, taking my report, and then finishing my inquiries into some
                        sections of the work which I was not able to complete during my first visit.
                        After consideration of my report Lord Cromer and the Government decided to
                        accept generally the suggestions made and to create a new Department
                        attached to the Ministry of Education, the position of Director General. I
                        have accepted the appointment, but I do not expect to formally commence
                        until October, I hope, however, to be able to go out for a month in April or
                        May in order to prepare the way for future work. I am attracted by the
                        immense possibilities of the country. The people have every confidence in
                        Lord Cromer, who has done magnificent work. He is intensely interested in
                        the whole movement, and so are the Minister of Education and the Educational
                        Advisor, Mr. Dunlop."</p>
                    <p>WOMEN'S EDUCATION. </p>
                    <p>The question of the education of women in Egypt has received the
                        consideration of Mr. Wells. "Up to the present," he said, "there has been
                        practically nothing done in the way of technical education for women, except
                        that which has just been commenced in the Girls' Secondary School and in one
                        of the schools for training women teachers for the Kattabs. My own hope is
                        that we may be able to do something for women in private schools of domestic
                        economy, where they will be taught to manage their own homes on better lines
                        and also receive instruction in what they very much need, the care and
                        bringing up of infants, so that the present infant mortality may be reduced.
                        Also, I think, there is a promising field in aging the skill of the native
                        women in art needlework, for which they seem to be specially qualified. But
                        this will be a work of time, and it will require a very great deal of care
                        owing to the position of women in Egypt. A good deal of sympathy has been
                        shown with the isles of doing some work of this kind. Lord Cromer himself is
                        most anxious that something should be done for the women when it can be
                        wisely done, and their side certainly will not be overlooked as far as I am
                        concerned."</p>

                        letter was read from Sir Edward Grey stating that the Foreign Office had
                        taken steps in the matter of the delays at the Port of Genoa. It appeared
                        that the Italian Government were fully alive to the gravity of the situation
                        caused by the delay, and were endeavouring to ameliorate them. They were
                        constructing along the line from Genoa to Milan numerous bindings, the
                        absence of which had caused delay by preventing the railway authorities at

                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</byline>
                    <dateline>LONDON, January 6. </dateline>
                    <p>Captain and Brevet Major G. B. Macauley, Royal Engineers, manager of the
                        Egyptian State Railways, has been placed on half pay under the provisions of
                        Article 92s, Royal Warrant, 1906.</p>
                    <p>Captain R. G. Stracey, 1st Battalion Soots Guards, has been selected for
                        employment with the Khedive's troops, and will join immediately at Cairo.
                        This officer has been connected with the Guards since August, 1900, and had
                        some experience in campaigning in the South African War, 1902, including the
                        operations in the Transvaal (Queen's medal with four clasps).</p>
                    <p>Commander A. G. Hotham and Commander J. E. T. Harper, on promotion, have been
                        re-appointed to the battleship Queen and the cruiser Bacchante, on the
                        Mediterranean Station, respectively, for navigation duties.</p>
                    <p>The country is still waiting on Mr. Haldane's ideal scheme which is to give
                        us "a nation in arms." The return of recruiting for the past year, just
                        published, shows that 36,465 men were enlisted, but opposed to this was a
                        wastage of 46,414-a difference of 10,000 men on the wrong side of the book.
                        This is a small army, from England's standpoint, in itself. The deficiency,
                        of course, can be accounted for to the satisfaction of those who care to
                        wade amongst the figures, but with such talk of economy with efficiency in
                        the air, the whole position is very far from being satisfactory. What Mr.
                        Haldane intends to take the place of our vanishing army he has not yet made
                        quite clear--perhaps not to himself. He has reduced the army without doing
                        anything to increase its efficiency in any one way, and he has earned for
                        himself the reputation of being a first class windbag in the Cabinet of
                        Government where that particular genus is well and ably represented. He is
                        still "considering problems," still telling us what he intends to do, And
                        after twelve months he has achieved nothing but destruction.</p>
                    <p>It is understood the various regiments of Royal Garrison Artillery Militia
                        will train as usual in the coming drill season, but for the limited period
                        of 21 days. Mr. Haldane's held batteries of Militia seems a long way off
                        yet.</p>

                    <p>Mayor of Scotstown Recommends Pe-ru-na for Colds and Catarrh.</p>
                    <p>Read his letter.</p>
                    <p>The first effect of a cold is a thickening of the mucous membranes of the
                        nose and throat.</p>
                    <p>This gives rise to a discharge, or at least a stillness of the nasal
                        passages.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes fever accompanies the first attack, also a feeling of languor,
                        dullness and aching of the bones.</p>
                    <p>If no attention is paid to it, the mucous congestion is liable to spread down
                        into the larynx, producing hoarseness and into the bronchial tube producing
                        a cough.</p>
                    <p>Even when this occurs, many people pay no attention to it.</p>
                    <p>Under such circumstances, the congestion is liable to become chronic,
                        producing a condition of the mucous membranes known as catarrh. Catarrh
                        lasts an indefinite time. </p>
                    <p>CURE COLDS -- PREVENTS CATARRH</p>
                    <p>Catarrh is essentially a chronic condition and does not leave except
                        something is done to relieve it.</p>
                    <p>What should be done when a person catches a cold is to take a few doses of
                        Peruna.</p>
                    <p>Taken at the onset, Peruna would break up the cold and prevent all the train
                        of symptoms which usually follow.</p>
                    <p>But, even in cases where the cold has been neglected and hoarseness or a
                        cough has developed, Peruna can be relied upon to give prompt and permanent
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>The frequency of coughs and colds in Canada makes Peruna a popular remedy in
                        this country.</p>

                    <p>"I write to tell you that I am perfectly well. I took only three bottles of
                        your Peruna according to your advice and the directions in your book and it
                        restored my health."</p>
                    <p>C.H. Parker, Ex-Warden of Compton Co. Quebec writes, "I had several attacks
                        of colds from time to time and finally a severe attack developed into
                        catarrh. I was advised to use your celebrated remedy and after taking three
                        bottles I find myself completley cured and I no longer suffer from cattarh
                        or colds."</p>
