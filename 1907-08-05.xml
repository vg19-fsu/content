                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the

                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or

                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot

                    <head>SIR E. GREY ON EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey's references to Egypt in his speech on the Foreign Office vote,
                        as summarised by the telegrams which we have published, will be accepted by
                        all, save by the small ultra-nationalist party, as still one more indication
                        of our desire to direct the Government of the country in the interests of
                        the people and to meet as far as possible their wishes. Regarding the
                        question of revising the sentences inflicted upon those found guilty of
                        active participation in the Denishwai outrage, the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs referred to the necessity of making a very severe example of
                        the convicted, and pointed out the langer of an act of clemency being
                        misconstrued into one of weakness. He gave every hope, however, that there
                        would be a revision of sentences "when the state of feeling neccesitating a
                        severe example had passed." But, unfortunately for all, there exists in
                        Egypt a psuedo-nationalist press, which immoderately denounces England's
                        every action regarding this country, which refuses to believe that an
                        English official can act for the good of the country or administrate with
                        wisdom, which loudly decries our every effort on behalf of the people, and
                        which-in fine-gives the impression that a fanatical and hysterical spirit is
                        existent. The cry of this press is "give us selfgovernment," but they refuse
                        to recognise that by their irrationality they harm the very cause for which
                        they so vociferously shout. We trust the day will come when an the day the
                        act of clemency, such as the revision of the sentences on the Denishwai
                        prisoners, will not be accepted as an act of weakness, when the supporters
                        of Mustapha Kamel and his colleagues will plead their cause in such a spirit
                        as to show us that it is possible of favourable consideration, and persuade
                        us that they are genuine and disinterested wellwishers of their country,
                        capable of reasonable action. As Sir E. Grey remarked, the withdrawal of
                        British influence would re-open the door to corruption, oppression, and
                        injustice. The Egypt of to-day has sprung into existence in an unparalleled
                        short space of time, and the education of the people is by no means
                        completed. The necessity for a guiding and protecting hand is acknowledged
                        by all whose opinion is of weight, and we are glad to recognise that our
                        policy receives support from the highest quarters and all advanced
                        Egyptians, while the poorer classes are quietly appreciative of the benefits
                        we have conferred upon them. The only possible fruit of the violent policy
                        pursued by certain of our confrères is distrust, for such agitation only
                        strengthens the conviction that a quarter of a century's continuous rule
                        under the immediate influence of the highest western civilisation has been
                        insufficient to import to the nation the wisdom and moderation necessary for
                        self: government.</p>

                    <p>JAPAN'S EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>On the situation in Korea the "Nation" remarks:-"Japan has brought about the
                        ab- dication of the Emperor as England and France brought about the fall of
                        the Khedive Ismail, and Korean independence enters upon a new phase. It is
                        possible to exaggerate the import- ance of the event. Even to the Emperor
                        the difference between reigning and abdicating must be little more than
                        verbal. The only function of anindependent sovereign which had remained to
                        him since the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war was the right of signing
                        under protest He has exercised it to the last</p>
                    <p>Were Korea a Japanese province the pros perity of the whole population would
                        be a national interest, while the natives would be Japanese subjects, who
                        would enjoy civil, and might ultimately aspire to political equality with
                        the conquerors. As a mere sphere of influence it is simply a field to be
                        developed by Japanese syndicates and colonised by Japanese veterans. One
                        hears already of the wholesale expropriation of land and the imposition of
                        the corvée, It is this material exploitation rather than the outrage of
                        Korean nationality which is the really sinister aspect of this in- direct
                        conquest."</p>

                        <p>The1 Cairo City police are apparently very much occupied with an expert
                            band of burglars who are working the capital in a very systematic

                    <p>The following preliminary note on the Nile Flood of 1907 has been issued by
                        Mr. W. R. Williams, acting Adviser to the Ministry of Public Works</p>
                    <p>In.the early summer the levels, while better than those of 1905, were
                        appreciably lower than those of the last year. An improvement took place
                        towards the end of April, and though it only lasted for three or four weeks,
                        it sustained the levels northwards for some time and admitted of
                        comparatively easy rotations. About the middle of May, howewer, the levels
                        up country dropped considerably and at Rosseires actually touched those of
                        1905, and though the flood began to rise within the usual time, it was weak
                        from the commencement and has since been interrupted by intervals during
                        which the river level has varied but slightly. Although the Atbara showed a
                        marked rise recently at Khashm el Girba and there were fair rains in the
                        Northern Sudan which were beneficial locally, they were not widespread and
                        had practically no effect on the Nile itself.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the weak approach of the flood, considerable care has hail to be
                        exercised in the regulation at the Assouan dam so as to provide an ample
                        supply for the irrigation of cotton and summer crops and Sharaki sowings,
                        and at the same time to keep sufficient reserve in- the reservoir to avoid
                        its being emptied too soon. This has been very effectively carried out and
                        the dam has again proved of invaluable assistance, and, in spite of the weak
                        beginning of the flood, it has enabled the removal of the Sharaki decree
                        prohibition from tho 21st. July in the Northern Provinces of the Delta and
                        from the whole of Upper and the remainder of Lower Egypt between the 25th
                        and the end of the month.</p>
                    <p>Captain Lyons, who has gone very carefully into the question, has snpplied
                        meteorological data and notes regatding the rain-fall and levels which go to
                        show that the former have been most unsatisfactory in Abyssinia, where the
                        rains have been persistently weak throughout.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, the gauge at Rosseires is over 1.50 metres below the
                        average of the last seven years (1900 to 1906) all of which were years of
                        flood which were well under theaverage ; and at Khartoum at the time of
                        writing, the river has touched the low level, on the same date, of the year
                        1905.</p>
                    <p>The rain-fall of June seems to have been on the whole as much as 50 %
                        deficient, and that of July nearly 30 % ; but news has just come that the
                        rain-fall during the last few days has shown an improvement and Rosseires
                        lias begun to rise a little. Even, however, if the rains of August and
                        September were to be fully up to the average, it looks as if we may expect a
                        flood of about 15 % below the normal of previous years : while, if the
                        latter portion of the rainy season proves bad, the flood volume may fall to
                        ns much as 20 or 25% below the average.</p>
                    <p>To sura up therefore, the flood is backward and weak and though the cotton
                        and summer irrigation and late summer Sharaki sowings are proceeding
                        satisfactorily owing to the assistance of the Assouan reservoir, there may
                        be some difficulty in irrigating some of the higher basin hmds in Middle
                        Egypt and East Giza ; and unless tho rainfall shown marked improvements in
                        August and September, the flood 'will remain a low one.</p>

                    <p>A supplement to the Official Journal of Saturday's date contains the
                        following im portant statement on the Cairo WaterSupply:— For some time past
                        complaints have been addressed to the Sanitary Administration upon the
                        subject of the had quality of drinking water supplied to the inhabitants of
                        Cairo. Articles have appeared in the journals and in fact general complaint
                        has been made that the water is infected, and is the primary cause of the
                        increased mortality among infanta, which of late has been so noticeable. It
                        is in the first place absolutely untrue, as has been alleged, that the
                        Sirdar had addressed to the Administration a complaint upon the quality of
                        the water. As to the above complaints a sufficient answer will be found in
                        the declarations.; made last year in a report published in the.</p>
                    <p>79 (supplement).</p>
                    <p>The water of the artesian wells comes from a depth of 60 metres and is free
                        of all bacteria, a statement proved by the examinations and analyses made by
                        several independent experts. The water after leaving the wells iB equally
                        free from any pathogenic microbes.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason then to consider the water of the artesian wells as
                        unwholesome. The increased mortality among*infants observed this year cannot
                        be due to the water from these wells, because at this particular period of
                        last year the town was snpplied in the same manner by this water.</p>
                    <p>The increase of infant mortality among children in the summer is equally
                        noticeable in Europe, and is due to several causes of which the following
                        are principal: (1) The weakening effect of the heat itself; (2) the usage of
                        goods insufficiently nourishing or adulterated, (3) and, in general, the
                        lack of care which is so necessary to the well being of every child.</p>
                    <p>In certain quarters of the town the inhabitants complain that the water has a
                        bad odour. ThiB odour iR due to the Nile water which during the low water
                        season, particularly in June and July, has often a bad smell, which it is
                        impossible to prevent even by the best filterage.</p>
                    <p>The number of artesian wells sunk up to the present is not entirely
                        sufficient for the needs of the town. The Water Company is therefore forced
                        to obtain a part of its supply from other sources, and as particularly
                        concerns the one of which complaint is mi a certain quantity of water from
                        the Nile passes through sand filters. When Cairo was entirely supplied with
                        Nile water t$iAbath odour was always perceived at the tiara of the low water
                        (Jane and July), and disappeared at the period of the rise upon the arrival
                        of the fresh water.</p>
                    <p>The public justly claims that the water taken from the taps has occasionally
                        a darkish appearance. This is dneto the fact that the water from the
                        artesianr wells contains in its origin a minute solution of iron and
                        magnesia. This is precipitated in an insoluahle form chiefly under the
                        influence of a fungus, well known under the name of Crenothrix. This fungus
                        can not live or increase in water containing a solution of iron or magnesia,
                        from which it causes a precipitation in the form of a black deposit Neither
                        the iron or the magnesia are in any way dangerous to health.</p>
                    <p>The Crenothrix is a fungus absolutely inoflesive and which is in no way
                        dangerous or of a pathogenic nature. This is clearly stated in several
                        excellent journals.</p>
                    <p>Its presence in the water, from a technical point of view is only to be
                        feared, because by the precipitation of the iron' and the magnesia, it
                        troubles the water and sometimes causes abundant precipitations which
                        obstruct a free delivery of water to the houses.</p>
                    <p>It is contended therefore that this darkening of the water is certainly a
                        little disagreeable but is in no way dangerous.</p>
                    <p>This inconvenience caused by the presence of Crenothrix, is produced in many
                        of the villages of Europe.</p>
                    <p>One can easily free the water supplied from any sign ot iron or magnesia by
                        the use of special filters.</p>
                    <p>Under the Council of the Sanitary Administration, the Water Company decided
                        several months ago upon the installation of certain filters of which they
                        have made a special study, but naturally a complete installation cannot be
                        made in a day or two. It will take at least a year. Until then the public
                        must be patient and endeavour to remedy the inconvenience of which they
                        complain, by themselves filtering the water and when it is seen to contain
                        iron to pass it through cotton wool, but there is no leaspn whatever to be
                        alarmed and to fear that the state of the water actually implies a danger to
                        the public health.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion a comparative table of water analyses is given from different
                        sources and different periods, and from which it can be seen that the water
                        from the artesian wells at Rodel-Faraq, though being a little more charged
                        with mineral salts than the Nile Water, is not more so than the water of
                        Zeitoun of which no complaint has been made, the water of Tantah, and the
                        celebrate water of Evian. </p>

                    <p>After the toasts of "The King" and "The Khedive." The Chairman propeeed that
                        of "Oar Guests. He said the object of the gathering r r__ was to promote
                        good will on earth. These were the days of ententes cordiales among nations
                        who used to regard themselves as inevitable enemies. </p>
                    <p>. There had lately been an entente cor- diale between England and Russia and,
                        although there had been a good doalof opposition to that, no one would
                        suggest a whisper of opposition to the suggestion that there ought to be an
                        entente oordiale between England and Egypt. Anything that helped to draw ns
                        closer together deserved the sympathy and support of every lover of
                        civilization. People nowadays were beginning to see that a great deal of the
                        bad blood and strife of the past might have been prevented if men had begun
                        to shake brands before quarrelling rather than after. One of their hopes was
                        that that gathering might help in preventing the growth of any such friction
                        between England and Egypt in the future as had had to be regretted in the
                        past as between England and Ireland and even latterly between England and
                        India. Thus far the situation was perfectly healthy: The feeling of
                        Egyptians towards this country was essentially one of good will. There was
                        nothing in the nature of a deep or sincere anti-English feeling in Egypt.
                        They hoped by that gathering to develop sympathy between the two peoples.
                        Egyptians were not extremists. They were simply asking that the promises
                        that were made over 20 years agp and held ontfin the Constitution drawn up
                        by Lord Dufferin should be gradually and reasonably fulfilled. (Cheers).</p>
                    <p>Hafiz Effendi Awad, responding in English, said, the cause be pleaded was
                        that Egyptians might be allowed to take their right and proper share in the
                        administration of their own affairs. They had a Khedive who reigned, but did
                        not rule. They had Ministers, governors of provinces, and other high
                        officials whose posts wwe'tnere sinecures. They possessed neither _ rity>n«r
                        responsibility It'was the British nirho ran themoohine of Government m all
                        its various details ; and there was this peculiarity and grave
                        inconvenience, that the Englishmen who were in the service of the Egyptian
                        Government, and who received their salaries from such Government, took their
                        orders from, and were responsible for their action to, not the Egyptian
                        Government, but the British Consul- General alone. That was an abnormal
                        condition of affaire which should not be allowed to continue indefinitely.
                        It was their belief that the time had now arrived when, following upon the
                        lines laid down in Lord Dufferia's scheme, a step forward might prudently be
                        taken for endowing Egypt with constitutional capacity. They did not ask for
                        power to revise treaties, or to alter their relations, financial and
                        otherwise, with European States. They did not ask that they should be
                        enabled to legislate where foreigners resident in Egypt were concerned. All
                        that they asked, for the present at least, was that they should be enabled
                        to legislate fti matters administrative, educational, judicial, and
                        financial, which solely appertained to their own people. To accomplish their
                        aims they proposed to do nothing that should savonr of revolution, but to
                        employ solely constitutional methods. If it be decreed that Egypt ipust fall
                        under the domination of a foreign Power, they preferred in their heart of
                        hearts that that Power should be England. But they appealed to the British
                        nation to aid them in realizing what they believed to be their reasonable
                        aspirations. (Cheers.)</p>
                    <p>Sheik Ali Bey Yussef, who also responded, said the English occupation t>f
                        Egypt took place under abnormal circumstances, and it was never intended by
                        the authors of the occupation that Egypt should become a British colony. He
                        felt assured that if at any time the occupation should cease, in accordance
                        with the pledges originally given, England would find in Egypt a grateful
                        ally and a loyal partner in the country over which their united flags waved.
                        The Egyptians were patting forward certain demands, and it would, in his
                        view, exhibit England in a noble light before the whole world were she to
                        accede to them. If they were asking that education should be rendered free
                        to the whole nation, it was because they knew that that was the only means
                        of elevating the masses. If they asked that the system of higher education
                        be rendered more thorough lhan at present, it showed the level to which the
                        educated classes in Egypt had already attained. And if they asked that all
                        knowledge Bhould be imparted in their native tongue, it was because they
                        knew that a nation could not take its rightful share in the advancement of
                        science save under suoh conditions. If they asked that Egyptians who were
                        competent for government employ should be preferred to aliens, they were
                        only vindicating a just claim. And if they asked thattbe Legislative Council
                        and General Assembly should be endowed with legislative powers, it was
                        because legislation in an alien garb could never be wholly satisfactory tola
                        people whose national conscience was awakening. Furthermore, if they asked
                        that criminal oases in which Europeans were charged, should be transferred
                        from the Consular Courts to the mixed tribunals, it was becanse it was the
                        simpler course These were the principal demands prescribed by the General
                        Assembly whom was recently convened. A general discussion followed.</p>

                        <head>THE MEGLIS ELHASBY:</head>
                        <p>To thb Editor op tub "Eqtptiax Gazette. "</p>
                        <p>Sir,—One of the departments of the Egyptian legal administration, which
                            is greatly in need of reform, is the Meglis el-Hasby. I will give you a
                            case in point Some years ago, in 1904, the Meglis el-Hasby at Alexandria
                            appointed a trustee to my father's property. This trustee did not
                            execute his trust in an equitably maimer.</p>
                        <p>In 1906 I brought an action against the trustee. The Sub-Governor of
                            Alexandria, Hafez Bey Mohamed, supported the trostee with his influence
                            and I could not get a judgment in the Meglis el-Hasby. I then appealed
                            to Mr. Machell, Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, and set all the
                            facts of the case before him. He at once settled the matter to my
                            satisfaction. This was in last June. Naturally I expected that after the
                            Adviser had interfered I could obtain satisfaction, but as he has gone

                    <p>M. Harduin, commenting in the "Matin" on the proposed grant of £50,000 to
                        Lord Cromer for his services in Egypt, sayft:—"LonLCromer ought to be
                        thankful that he was born in England, and that it was to that country that
                        he rendered his eminent service. If he had been bom in France, and had
                        rendered similar servioes, the only result would have been that the official
                        "Gazette" would have published on its front page a decree appointing him
                        "Grand- offioer" of the Legion ofHononr. The noble and disinterested spirit
                        of a Frenchman is supposed to be content .with the possession of a beautiful
                        red ribbon which he can put on, and, contem plating himself in the mirier,
                        think of the glory which is reflected by his person. The Englishman, being
                        without poetry, prefers good pounds sterling—he looks at the comfort which
                        they will ensure for Kim."</p>

                    <byline>(From Our Correspondent).</byline>
                    <p>Nearly fifty years ago, when Princess Pauline de Mettemich Sandor introduced
                        Wagner's music to the Court of Napoleon III. she was unable to obtain an
                        audience. Could she have seen the music. </p>
                    <p>A blue sky over an emerald sea, waves dancing in the Bunlight and a cool
                        breeze, bringing with it a sensation of languourous contentment, were
                        elements calculated to enhanoe the enjoyment of the conoert given by the
                        Bracale orchestra. Apart from actual stage representations of the operas, I
                        prefer to hear Wagner out-of-doore and the conditions at San Stefano compare
                        favourably with those in which we listen to a concert in the Queen's Hall
                        (for example), even though the orchestra be the famous one presided over by
                        Mr. Henry J. Wood. Every member of the orchestra (which was considerably
                        augmented for the ocoaaion and included two ladies who lent their valuable
                        aid) played 'con aroore.'</p>

                        and this was wholly satisfied. I preferred the first item in the programme,
                        the pi elude to the third act of ' Lee Maltres Chanteurede Nuremberg," but
                        the "RMeof of the Valkyries" was admirably performed and reoeived an

                    <head>THE INSCRIPTIONS OF SINAI <lb/>AN INTERESTING DISCVERY.</head>
                    <p>For some years past travellers in Sinai have noticed a number of curious
                        inscription* 6a the rock* in the wadis or valleys of the Psoinsula.</p>
                    <p>The earliest traveller to note and copy these graffiti was the Indian
                        explorer Foster, who passed through the country on his way to the Far East
                        in the early part of the eighteenth centnry. This traveller unhesitatingly
                        ascribed them to the Israelites, who, aooording to his theory, inscribed
                        them during their forty years' • wanderings. Others again attributed then to
                        pious pilgrims to Sinai, while some were of opinion that they were the woric
                        of shepherds. Against this last theory it was urged that few, if any of the
                        modem Bedouin or shepherds of the district can either read or write, how
                        much less therefore those of the firet and second centuries to which date
                        the inscriptions of Sinai certainly belong. All these theories have now been
                        finally disposed of by the recent researches of Professor Eutiny, who has
                        made a systematic examination of the whole district in which they are found,
                        and has carefully studied and published the texts. The real authors of these
                        inscriptions turn out to have been Nabathtean traders, who from time to time
                        passed &lt; through the Sinaitic Peninsula with their caravans to the
                        markets of Egypt and Palestine, and who thus left behind them the records of
                        their visits. The chief importance of the Sinaitic inscriptions lies in the
                        fact that they represent the transitory stage of Nabathieah on the one hand
                        and Neski Arabic on the other.</p>

                    <p>"For a period of 12 or 13 /years," says Mr. Thomas Little, 5 Bloch,
                        Caledonian Buildings, Motherwell, Scotland, "I was constantly troubled with
                        rhempatism ; so bad was it at times that I had to givte up work. I dttrilmte
                        my illnes* to a chill; when I had anything like (kycold it fiew to my
                        kidneus. The urinary secretions were cloudy ana bill of sediment. But 'my
                        worst trouble was, I was crippled by sciatica and rheumatism. The pain was
                        terrible in my left hip and thigh ; the sinews on my leg seemed to be
                        contracted, for I could not putr my heel to the ground. I could not
                        straighten my leg, and could only step on my toes. There was an awful,
                        constant gnawing pain. My shoulders and arms, also were full of aches; jny
                        knee, troubled me, being badly swollen for years. The pain in my back,
                        especially over the right kidney, was just as if a knife had been stuck into
                        me.</p>
                    <p>"This will give you some idea of my suffering. Then I read of the cure by
                        Doans Backache HidnSy Pills of a case similar to mine, andVtecided to give
                        them a trial. It was a happy resolve. Before I had finished the first box my
                        back1was easier; not only that, but the rhedtatatism was much easier in my
                        leg. I continued With the pills, and was cured. I need scarcely say I esteem
                        them a most wonderful medicine."</p>

                            <p>The Norddeutsche Zeitung has published an Article concerning the
                                meeting of the Tsar and the Emperor William. The Tsar, it says,
                                undertaking this journey into Germaij waters is returning the
                                Emperor's visit of 1905. This meeting conforms with ancient customs
                                which are pleasantly maintained on both wiles, and it is a new
                                manifestation of the friendship which the two monarchs have received
                                as a tradition from their ancestors, and which is laithfully
                                goarded. The principal objeot of their visits to Swinemunde is a
                                personal one. There is no political motive for their meeting and it
                                cannot be looked npon by any one with suspicion or distrust.</p>
                            <p>In Germany the Tsar's visit is received with satisfaction as a
                                manifestation of the cordial existing between the'two dynasties and
                                the two Empires, which are united by so many ties. k % (Reuter)</p>

                    <head>THE IONIAN BANK-</head>
                    <p>As a branch of the Ionian Bank is shortly to be opened in this city, and a*
                        it is a bank of vory old standing, having boon founded in 1839, it will be
                        interesting to our readers that we should give a short history of its
                        antecedents.</p>
                    <p>The Ionian Bank is an Anglo-Groek institution, and it, and the National Bank
                        of Greece, which is a purely local institution, are the only banks of issue
                        in Greece. ;</p>
                    <p>According to the custom of the times when these banks were founded, whioli
                        custom still prevails in Greece, they were respectively formed under
                        Conventions with the Government* of tho Ionian Republio, and the Greek
                        kingdom, and in the case of the former, fn conformity with Act 78 of the
                        Fourth Session of the Fifth Parliament, which by Art 1 vested in tbe
                        Executive Government the ueoinary powers,</p>
                    <p>' This law, then in force in the Ionian Republic, was understood to be based
                        on the Venetian, and therefore ultimately on the Roman Low. Under it the
                        character and attributes of a corporate body attach at onoe upon an
                        association acting nnderan aggregate name, without designation of the
                        individuals who compose it-; but as the law had not been reduced into a
                        recognised ooae, and as associations in the nature of joint stock companies
                        were new to the Ionian Islands, it was considered indispensable that the
                        requisite powers for enabling the Bank to act in its aggregate capacity, as
                        an individual subject of tho states, should be conferred by means of a
                        Convention in express terms. *</p>
                    <p>In great Britain, before the introduction of the Joint Stock Companies' Acts,
                        a somewhat similar procedure was requisite, sod the agreement concluded with
                        the crown, including the statutes of the company, was called a charter.
                        Here, in Egypt, foreign cotnpam validly constituted, are wholly independent
                        of any Government authorization or control ; but a Firman of His Highness
                        the Khedive, approving of the conditions contained in the articles of
                        association of a company proposing to constitute itself in Egypt, and
                        authorising its formation, is necessary, under Article 46 of the Native
                        Tribunals.</p>
                    <p>Although tho Ionian Bank is older than the National Bank, by three years, it
                        having been established in 1839, the year Greece was declared an independent
                        kingdom, it did not commence operations in the mainland of Greece, until the
                        year 1864, when the Ionian Islands were coded to Greece; but the commercial
                        relations of the two states during the earlier period of their existence
                        were intimate and necessitated the establishment of agencies by the Ionian
                        Bank in two or three of the towns of Greece.</p>
                    <p>Practically, the life of these two banks oovers the banking and currency
                        history of the modem kingdom of Greece, and they, alone, of the bonks
                        existing in Greece to-day, passed through the severe financial vicissitudes
                        of tho earlier cxistence of the State ; and from being privileged, and to a
                        certain extent State Banks were specially affected by the currency
                        difficulties between 1881 and 1890-</p>
                    <p>Whilst the National Bank is distinguished from all other banks in Greece,
                        having regard to the volume of its business, it* semi-official status, it*
                        influence which it exercises through the commanding character of its
                        Govornor.and a large body of shareholders, it* uniqueness of many of it*
                        details of management, and it* suocess of late years, it cannot be said
                        that, in respect of stability, and credit, and thk conservative character of
                        its administration'that it* reputation exceeds that of the Ionian I|ank.</p>
                    <p>As the Ionian Bank's history is specially bound up with that of the Ionian
                        Islands, a few introductory remarks will explain how Great Britain became
                        specially interested in the Ionian Islands, and how the bauk became
                        established there.</p>
                    <p>The Ionian Islands lie between the south of Italy and the west ooast ot
                        Greece, immediately off the south west coast of Albania, and they figure in
                        the ancient history of Greece.</p>
                    <p>Originally, Corfou, one of the Seven Inlands, was colonised by the
                        Corinthians, and the</p>
                    <p>earliest natal engagement in history wee that in 684B.C. between the
                        Corfiotes (Corcyreh) and the Corinthians.</p>
                    <p>Tn the 15th Century, tho Seven Inlands passed into the hands of the
                        Venetians.</p>
                    <p>As Venice left her indelible mark in the social characteristics, and
                        political economy of these islanders, it is os well to point oat that Venice
                        was more of a Greek than an Italian town, dating from the Latin conquest of
                        Constantinople; and the state, of. which it was the ohief town, woe a
                        patrioion Republio oopied from Bysontine model. | Subsequently, on the
                        arrival of the Turks in the Peloponnessns, they drove out the
                        reigningpredatory Greeks, the military element who dominated that oountiy,
                        and who owned ollegianoe to the emperors of the east, and there, under the
                        name of "Eetrodjoto," become military settlers in the Venetian State, and in
                        other States who sought them as mercenaries.</p>
                    <p>Of the Venetians, Dante thus speaks, in a letter he wrote to Guido da Polenta
                        — "it is "not a thing to make marvel, that they (the "Venetians) do not know
                        how to speak Italian, 'Tor they are descended from Dalmatians "and Greeks."
                        Seeing the oloee connetion between1 the Venetians and the Ionians, it will
                        be readily understook that the settlement of the Venetians in the Seven
                        Islands partook of a peaceable ooonpation.</p>
                    <p>In the 18th century, the Seven Islands were first token by the Frenoh, who,
                        in their turn, were expelled by the Russians and the Turks ; and early in
                        the 19th century, by the Treaty of Tilsit, Russia ceded them to France.</p>
                    <p>Franoe oocupied them from 1807 until 1809, exoept Corfu, which she did not
                        surrender until 1814.</p>
                    <p>Between 1809 and 1814, thoy were gradually token possession of by the British
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>Tbe importance of the Ionian Islands, as a military and naval post, was well
                        knowb, and, also, that Venice made Corfu her ohief arsenal and odvanoe-post
                        for her operations in the East. It wes these considerations, and that they
                        were oocupied by the French, that induced the British to capture them. When
                        they did so, thoy made Zante the capital, and it became the head quarters of
                        the British forces and Admiralty.</p>
                    <p>In 1815, by the Treaty of Parte, which the Ionian* considered their Magna
                        Charto, they were placed under the protection of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>From the first birth of their independence by Art. 9, of the Treaty of
                        Aipiens, they were the objeot of considerable interest to the great
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>They had a Senate, which were a restoration ot the Venetian plan of
                        administration, and a Legislative Assembly, and they assumed the title of
                        the United States of "the Ionians islands;" but they were practically ruled
                        by tlie British Lord High Commissioner.</p>
                    <p>The Ionian Bank was projected by the Lord' High Commissioner, Lieutenant
                        General Sir Howard Douglas.</p>
                    <p>lie suggested it* formation as a means for remedying the many grievances and
                        exactions which the necessitous small landowners were enduring from tbe
                        local money lenders, who bought up their harvest of oil and currants every
                        year.</p>
                    <p>Overtures were made by him in the year 1838, through the medium of Sir
                        Alexander Wood, the Agent in London for the Ionian 8tatos, to oertoin
                        capitalist* in England, for the formation of a Company, which resulted in
                        the Ionian Bank being formed with a capital of £100,000, and a invention was
                        finally granted to the bank by the United States of the Ionian Islands, on
                        the 23rd October 1839.</p>
                    <p>On the 2nd March 1840, the bank was opened for business at Corfu, on the 18th
                        May at Zante, and on the 10th August at Cephalonia In 1844, the bonk applied
                        to the British Governments and obtained a charter subject to the usual
                        conditiona In 1864, Mr. Gladstone, by the Treaty of London, with the three
                        Great Powers, who signed the Treaty of Paris, procured the anion of the
                        Septinsulsr Republic with the Kingdom of Greece.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gladstone was influenced in this stage, not only by the dictates of his
                        own sympathetic spirit, but by the political unrest ofthe Ionians of Greek
                        origin, who considered themselves deprived of their just rights and
                        liberties under the Treaty of Paris, by their constitutional remonstrances
                        against the administration of the Islands by some ofthe high-salaried
                        British officials; and by their natural desire for unity with Greece, whose
                        independonoo was guaranteed by the Great Powers. i</p>
                    <p>Tbe official transfer of the Islands was carried out by 8ir H. K. Stevens one
                        of whose Secretaries at the time, wa* Mr. Evelyn Baring, now Lord
                        Cromer-Under this Treaty, the right* and privileges of the Ionian Bank, as
                        far as they were comprised in its original convention, and renewals of the
                        same, were protected and guaranteed by the three Great Powers and
                        Greece.</p>
                    <p>Thenceforth, it became a privileged bank in Greece, and had to enter into
                        communication with the Greek Government for tho purpose of ascertaining and
                        defining its status The result was, that it obtained the right by convention
                        to carry on its business throughout the newly constituted Kingdom ; and all
                        the privileges and advantages accorded to the National Bank of Greece,
                        regarding legal procedure, were conceded to it.</p>
                    <p>It also obtained the right to issue notes, on its own account, up to 9
                        million drachmas ; and, on Government aoconnt, up to 3} millions; which
                        notes under the forced currenoy law* became legal tender In 1882, the Ionian
                        Bank Act wa* passed, by whioh the Royal Charter, which had become
                        antiquated, was determined, and power was</p>

                    <p>And the stability of the finance* of the country under the condition* of the
                        arrangement arrived at in 1898, and the great natural enhancement of the
                        paper drachma to almost par, and the re-establishment of confidence, confirm
                        the belief that the country will continue it* progress.</p>
                    <p>It is also to be expected, that, shortly, the inconvertible bank-note, as far
                        as Greece is concerned, will became a discarded tool, a dark vision of an
                        unwholesome financial part, and substance, in the shape of gold, will ofice
                        more reign as the means and measure of the exchange of wealth, and the
                        reservoir of loanable capital.</p>
                    <p>The entension of the commercial relations of Greece with foreign parts, and
                        especially with Egypt, and the competition of the local banks which renders
                        the employment of money in Greece comparatively nnreinandrative, and the
                        attraction!! of this progessive and economically sound country have induced
                        the authorities of the Bank to establish a Branch here.</p>
                    <p>There cannot be a doubt that the Bank ha* arrived in Egypt at an opportune
                        moment, wbpn the business public are smarting frotn the disappointments and
                        losses of severe financial crisis, and will be ready to weloome the
                        facilities which a bonk new to this field may offer; and when Greeks,
                        especially, who are numerous here, will be more inclined to rally round an
                        institution which they have known from their childhood.</p>
                    <p>The Bank's capital is small in comparison with tnany of the important
                        institutions already established here, only about £400,000 including its
                        reserves; but we understand there is an intention of increasing the capital

                        went away to Scarborough,vbut rotufned borne worse than ever." This was the
                        statement of Miss Rachel Jackson, 10, Moorfield-street, Savill Park,
                        Halifax, who added "I had been brought to a terrible state by the lingering
                        tortures of anwmia. My face was white and drawn, and I grew so listless and
                        depressed that nothing -interested me. My heart palpitated violently at
                        times, and I suffered so from shortness^ breath that I had to hold on to
                        chair*. I was never free from dull, heavy headaches, while all appetite
                        vanished, for the lightest meal was followed by most acute pains of
                        indigestion. Then my nerves became so affected that I was afraid to be left
                        alone. At this time I went away to Scarborough, as mentioned, without
                        deriving any benefit.</p>
                    <p>One day my mother obtained two boxes of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pele

                        and regained a little strength. My appetite began.to mend, and I found that
                        I could actually digest what I had eaten. Refreshing sleep came as I
                        continued with the pills. My breath wa* sound, and there was a colour in my
                        cheeks. As I Kept on with Dr. Williams' Pink Pills I felt stronger and
                        stronger, until I became as well as you soo me now.</p>
