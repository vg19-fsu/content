                    <p>The news published by a morning contemporary a few days ago that negotiations
                        were proceeding between a Cairo group of financiers and the direction of the
                        above bank for the purchase of its property in the Sharia El Manakh at the
                        price of L.E. 160,000, is devoid of foundation. The Bank has received
                        several very advantageous offers but so far none have even been
                        entertained.since it has not yet been decided whether to enlarge the present
                        premi es or seek new ones elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that the property in question was bought by the
                        late Mr. Moseley, then local manager, on behalf of the bark some 6 or 7
                        years ago from Mme. Veuve Mera Ismalum for £18,000; the improvements and
                        additions, including co-t of building of the two shops fronting the main
                        street, brought the total up to about £30,000. Previons to this the house
                        was occupied for several years by the General Commanding the Army of
                        Occupation until the purchase in 1900 of the house in the Kasr-el-Dubara

                    <p>A new company has been formed and the capital privately subscribed for the
                        acquisition from Saifullah Pasha Yousry of his property situated in the
                        Sharia Soliman Pasha, close to the Standard Life Buildings, consisting of
                        some 7,000 square metres, at the price of LE. 25 per metre, plus a large
                        number of deferred shares. As a proof of the immense appreciation during the
                        past two years in the price of good building sites in the Ismaïlieh quarter
                        of the capital, which, by the way, have now become quite rare, we may
                        mention that the ground in question, with the old Pension Fink that formerly
                        stood on a portion of it, was bought by the late proprietress about eight
                        years ago-when Mine Fink sold her house in the 3haria Kasr-el-Nil to the
                        Bink of Egypt-from Abdel Kader Pasha, a former Minister of the Interior, for
                        £14,000. It was acquired by pre-emption in 1905 by. Osman Bey Cherif and was
                        sold by him for £92,000 to the present owner. This works out at £13 the
                        metre, so that the property has more than doubled in value in two years or
                        so.</p>

                        which would give the city Corniche route to Ramleh without any cost. The
                        company offer to reclaim from the sea a certain portion of land part of
                        which, twenty metres wide, would form the road. The conditions are that the
                        balance of the land thus reclaimed should become the pr perty of the company
                        In order to protect this road from the sea the company undertake to
                        construct a break water, protecting the entire length of the road. The
                        breakwater would be so built as to leave a broad channel between it and the
                        new reclaimed sea front, wherein could be constructed baths and amenities of

                    <p>THE KHEDIVE'S DECLARATION.</p>
                    <p>The declaration of the Khedive in "Le Temps" has aroused universal interest.
                        It is obvious that the interview, which has the air of a political
                        manifesto, was given with all due deliberation with a view to publicity. M.
                        Réné Puaux, to whom the Khedive made the announcement, has recently been on
                        a visit to Egypt as a special commissioner for the Parisian "Temps.' He is a
                        well-known French journalist and would not have ventured to transmit to the
                        important newspaper, which he represented, any imperfect or unauthorised
                        version of his Highness's declarations. The statements of the Khedive must
                        therefore be considered as having been deliberately authorised by his
                        Highness with a view to the wid st publicity</p>
                    <p>We have received the following telegraphic summary of the Khe live's
                        statements from our London correspondent:</p>
                    <p>LONDON, Monday.</p>
                    <p>M. René Puaux, the correspondent of the "Temps," has had an interview with
                        the Khedive in which his Highness, said that the necessities of the peculiar
                        political sitation had long compelled him to refrain from giving public
                        expression to his views on the affairs of the country, but he was told that
                        his silence might be misconstrued abroad, and he was aware that in Egypt it
                        was interpreted in various ways, so he availed himself of the opportunity of
                        expressing his opinions and ideas and referred to the Egyptians as people of
                        pro-ress, whose intelligence had found application in the development of the
                        modern civilisation of Egypt. The day was approaching when the Egyptian
                        peasant would equal the peasaut of most civilised countries. Finan- ces had
                        recovered stability, and the confidence of Europe had come back to us in
                        such a measure that Cairo and Alexandria are now two of the most important
                        financial centres in the world. International concern in the Egyptian debt
                        being no at an end, it was time to devote all efforts not only to the
                        material welfare of the population, but to the satisfaction of their
                        intellectual and moral requirements. He emphatically denied that national
                        claims assumed an anti-foreign and a fanatical form It had been stated that
                        he aspired to the restoration of his personal power to exercise it in the
                        oriental fashion, and to return to the methods of despotism and dissipation
                        of certain of his predecessors. His reply was that his European education
                        taught him the necessity of the co-operation of the nation with the
                        sovereign for the administration and good of the country. If his thoughts
                        only tended to the satisfaction of his personal vanity his reign would have
                        been one long intolerable period of suffering. He always set personality on
                        one side and had but one line of political conduct, namely, to work in
                        agreement with anybody for the good of his country. He never opposed any
                        measures which he believed to be useful to Egypt and never refused
                        advice.</p>
                    <p>LONDON PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
                    <p>(Gazette's Special Service.)</p>
                    <p>LONDON, Tuesday. The statements of the Khedive in "Le Temps" have caused a
                        considerable sensation here and are the subject of criticism in the Press.
                        The newspapers specially comment on the significance of the fact that the
                        Khedive, in the interview, omitted any mention or acknowledgment of
                        England's services to him and to his country.</p>
                    <p>LOCAL PRESS OPINIONS.</p>
                    <p>The comments of the local French newspapers are instructive. "La Réforme,"
                        with an air of deep foreboding, remarks: "We are clearly convinced that we
                        are drawing nigh to a crisis the issue of which we cannot foresee." "Le
                        Progrès" says: "If the thoughts of the Khedive have not been changed so as
                        to be past recognition, his Highness appears to have come out of the
                        obscurity in which he has hitherto shrouded himself and to have res lutely
                        put himself at the head of the Nationalist Party."</p>
                    <p>"La Bourse Egyptienne :" "The Egyptian Standard" is enthusiastic at this very
                        vague profession of faith, but we may point out that it was difficult for
                        the Khedive to have it spoken in a different way. It seems to be otiose to
                        conculde therefrom that his Highness is an out-and-out supporter of Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel."</p>
                    <p>"L'Egypte" is very gloomy as to the future outlook. It concludes a long
                        article on the Nationalist Party with the following halucination of the
                        impending catastrophe: "What will happen to the Nationalists 1 By means of
                        exciting the Egyptians against the Europeans they will oblige the latter to
                        take some steps, which at first may be only just and severe, but may later
                        on become violent and possibly unjust, and in the tempest that will ensue
                        there will disappear the prosperity of the country which rendered the people
                        so happy, and all the institutions, as yet imperfect, whose normal and
                        progressive development is impatiently expected by the country Then the
                        object of Mustapha amel will have been attained. All the world will know
                        him, but how loud will</p>
                    <p>be the curses against him? The Egyptian Standard" says: "These declarations
                        of the Sovereign will fill with lelight the heart of every Egyptian and of
                        every European who is a friend of Egypt......</p>
                    <p>Permit tis for the moment to express our highest thanks to His Highness for
                        having refuted the stupid accusation of fanaticism and the no less stupid
                        accusation of intrigues made -as is asserted-in favour of the restoration of
                        the personal power of the Khedive."</p>

                    <p>"Al Moayad," in its issue of yesterday, is</p>
                    <p>very discreet and says it will be better to wait for the complete text of the
                        declarations before comment. But it remarks that it is a pity that certain
                        newspapers have read into his Highness's remarks certain allusions to the
                        present political situation in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>"Al Zaher" declares that the declaration has been received with pleasure by
                        the nation for it is a happy augury to see oriental potentates announcing
                        their line of policy to the world, thus showing that they respect public
                        opinion.</p>

                    <head>GHEZIREH FLOWER SHOW.</head>
                    <p>The Flower Show at Ghezireh opened on Saturday was the last to take place
                        under the aspices of the Khedivial Horticultural Society; the reorganized
                        society, which has the same aims in view, to be known in future as the
                        Commercial Horticultural Society. The opening ceremonies on Saturday were
                        performed by Lady Cromer,, attended by Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel.
                        punctually at 8 o'clock, both of wh m made a tour of the building and
                        adjoining sheds and expressed their great satisfaction at the excellence of
                        the exhibits. Quite one of the leading features of the exhibition was the
                        magnificent display of cinirarias freezias, pansies, and other ornamental
                        plants'staged in the great entrance hall under the direction of Mr. Curtis
                        of the P.WD, wide borders of grass displaying these masses of bloom to the
                        greatest advantage.</p>
                    <p>The Ethel Lady Cromer Prize, which is annually presented by Prince Hussein
                        Pasha Kamel, was awarded this year to Dr. Keatinge for his wonderful hybrid
                        freezia. Up to the present no one has been able to produce this flower in
                        any colour but white or yellow; hence Dr. Keatinge's hybrid, which is of a
                        delicate rose shade, is a very important innovation, and a valuable addition
                        to the garden.</p>
                    <p>At the east entrance to the hall were some beautiful groups of foliage plants
                        arranged by the Government Garden Department, and Boniteau Bey was
                        responsible for a varied collection of well cultivated flowering and foliage
                        plants, including some magnificent</p>
                    <p>crotons.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the unfavourable season the exhibition of cut blooms was
                        extremely varied and interesting, including beautiful groups of gladiolus,
                        arum lilies and a large variety or annual flowers Dr. Keatinge, Mme Debbane,
                        Mrs. Crafton, M18. Rowlett, Mr Findley, and Abdoula chammed were all prize
                        winners in this division, the roses shown by the latter being especially
                        fine.</p>
                    <p>The prettily decorated lunch and dinner tables also attracted much attention;
                        the first prize for the latter going to Effendi Moussa for his treatment of
                        tea roses and sweet peas, while Miss Johnston gained the second prize for
                        her delightful arrangement of liliesof-the-valley and ferns in low silver
                        vases on a table centre of white drawn thread work over pale green. The same
                        clever lady also won a prize for her beautiful group of foliage plants and
                        flowers, which included handsome specimens of arums, tulips, freezins,
                        cinirarias, violets, etc. Mrs. Maclean was more fortunate in her exhibits of
                        baskets and vases of flowers than in her table decoration, and some of the
                        arrangements of cut flowers by native gardeners were extremely fine, that of
                        roses and hyacinths, the work of Abou El Morg Aly, being specially worthy of
                        notice.</p>
                    <p>A prize of ten pounds was offered by the society to the native grower who
                        obtained the highest number of awards in the vegetable section. This
                        resulted in keen competition amongst the native growers, who brought a large
                        number of vegetables and fruit of good quality; and some of the vegetable
                        marrows, cabbages, cauliflowers, and onions were of mammoth proportions. In
                        the same department were also some very interesting exhibits of jams,
                        liqueurs, etc.</p>
                    <p>Under the auspices of the reorganized society, experimental gardens are being
                        started at Ghizeh and Ghezireh for the introduction of new vegetables,
                        fruit, and trees, and the distribution of seed and young plants The
                        exhibitions will in future be held under the auspices of this society, as
                        before stated, the offices of which are at Ghizeh.</p>

                    <head>THE MOORE CASE</head>
                    <p>The "Mokattam" gives an account of some strange revelations which have been
                        made by the Parquet of Chebin-el-Kom in reference to the charges brought
                        against Mr. Moore. Our contemporary states that when the Parquet
                        interrogated the first witness called up by El Sergani, the witness took the
                        oath and declared: "May the Lord preserve me from doing harm to Mr. Moore
                        and stop me from bearing false testimony against him. But why should I do
                        harm to a person who has never harmed me or anyone else 1"</p>
                    <p>Then the witness produced copies of telegrams addressed some to him and some
                        to one of his relations. The senders offered him 300 pounds if he would bear
                        false testimony against Mr. Moore, by accusing him of having extorted money
                        from him.</p>
                    <p>It is also stated that the witness declared that gold was flowing in
                        abundance on this occasion, and those who desired to enrich themselves had
                        only to promise to bear false testimony.</p>

                        <head>THE EGYPTIAN INVESTMENT AND AGENCY LIMITED.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE" Dear Sir,-As an investor in this
                            company at a time when the shares were considerably over £2 in price, I
                            had some hope that the recent correspondence-in your paper would have
                            the result of obtaining an intimation as to the intentious of the Board
                            with regard to the present anomalous position of the shareholders who
                            have paid 20s. per share and only receive a dividend on 58.</p>
                        <p>From the evident intention of the Chairman in his annual speeches to
                            avoid all mention of this subject, although it must have often been
                            brought before the Board, it appears that the directors are interested
                            in maintaining the present inequality of treatment, and I am puzzled to
                            know what can be the reason of their doing so, and thereby keeping the
                            company in its present limited state of development at a moment when
                            cpital can be so profitably employed in Egypt and every other financial
                            company is increasing its sphere of operations.</p>
                        <p>No information has been vonchsafed to the shareholders as to the number
                            of shares held with 20s paid and those on which 5s. only has been paid,
                            and I am driven to the conclusion that those of the latter category are
                            mainly held by the directors, who find it more profitable.</p>
                        <p>There is also the advantage for the directors that the shareholders in
                            Egypt in parting with their nominative shares for the provisional
                            certificates issued by the Anglo-Egyptian Bank have sacrificed their
                            voting power, and the Board has nothing to fear and can continue to draw
                            their £200 a year each for their good investment of £125 for many years
                            to come. The Anglo-Fgyptian Bank is naturally highly satisfied with the
                            present arrangement, which gives them the use of nearly £150,000 of

                        <p>THE BRITISH CLUB.</p>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE FGYPTIAN GAZETTE" Sir, I was born and bred in
                            Liverpool, the son of a British subject, and am an Englishman in
                            everything except my surname. According to the rules of the British Club
                            all British subjects are eligible for election to the club, yet I was
                            refused admission to the club because my application, as I am told,
                            "cannot be considered under the present rules and byelaws of the club."
                            My proposer, Mr. H. O'Donnell, was informed that the real reason why I
                            could not belong to the club was because I was not a genuine Britisher
                            but only a British subject and so, I presume, a sort of pariah. I have
                            every claim to be an Englishman by domicile under the law of England and
                            it seems to me that such an extraordinary theory of racial caste
                            feeling, as exemplified by the proceedings of the British Club in my
                            case, cannot be in any way justified. To display such a narrow idea of
                            race is to injure the Empire, for why should we Englishmen, who happen
                            to have foreign names, be excluded from a British club? There are
                            thousands of thoroughbred Englishmen with absolutely foreign names of
                            every sort and kind. On such grounds, I presume, no member of the Royal
                            Family would be allowed to belong to the British Club because they have
                            a German surname. The patrician descendants of the An- cient Britons,
                            who decided the question of my exclusion from the club on account of my
                            name, would on identical grounds exclud Lord Cromer because the name of
                            Baring is not two hundred years old in England. Under such a system the
                            old families of the Channel Isles would be excluded and also the many
                            descendants of the Huguenot refugees who settled in England after the
                            revocation of the Edict of Nantes.</p>
                        <p>I do not write this because I am vexed at my exclusion from the club. On
                            the contrary I have no wish to be a member on sufferance. But I am
                            convinced that if this petty interpretation of the term "Britisher" were
                            in vogue throughout the Empire, the bonds which unite us together as a
                            whole would be terribly weakened by such an extraordinarily narrow inter
                            pretation of one of the widest and most honourable designations for a
                            great part of the human race. I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>The hired troopship Rewa arrived this morning from Bombay having on board
                        different drafts and details, amounting to 1,635 officers and men, Major
                        Elen, of the Oxford Light Infantry, being the commanding officer. The Rewa
                        entered the Canal in the forenoon bound to Southampton. This is her last
                        trip for this year's trooping season.</p>

                    <p>The general meeting of this company was held at Alexandria yesterday. The
                        directors submitted their report and accounts for the nine months ending
                        31st December, 1906, which we are sure will be found very satisfactory by
                        the shareholders, for, in spite of the fact that more than half the
                        company's fleet was delivered by the builders at intervals between the
                        months of July and September,and therefore was earning dividends only for an
                        average period of about four months, the profit and loss account enables the
                        directors to pay a dividend at the rate of 5% per annum on the capital of
                        the company, to transfer to depreciation account the substantial sum of
                        £5,000, carry forward £976. 12. 11, and to write off a further sum of
                        £1,521. 10. 0 from goodwill and preliminary expenses, and this in spite of
                        the fact that, owing to the great increase in the cost of shipbuilding since
                        the steamers were bought, the company's fleet to-day, which is mostly
                        composed of brand new steamers only a few months old, is worth many
                        thousands of pounds more than the company paid for them,</p>

                    <p>women will appreciate how severe was the trial qf Mrs. Jessie Henderson,
                        1224, Spring- bum place, Glasgow. To-day she states that store of strength
                        she found in Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale people. "Some time after the
                        birth of my youngest child," Mrs. Henderson stated, "my health rapidly gave
                        way until it broke down entirely. Instead of regaining my u*ual strength, I
                        was dismayed to find that I remained in a low, weak state that became more
                        and- more pronounced. "I was quite unfit to do anything in the house, and
                        the doctor who had attended me said my system Was completely run-down, and
                        that all my troubles were due to Aggravated bloodlessness I tried to get my
                        strength up - by plenty of nourishment, but I simply could not take anything
                        in the shape of food. Everything disagreed with me ; if I did venture to eat
                        a little I suffered agonies of indigestion. "In addition painful boils broke
                        out all over my body, and I gradually went from bad to worse. What with
                        shortness of breath, palpitation and other ailments, I feared my children
                        would soon be motherless. I was so terribly weak that on going upstairs I
                        had to sit down and rest several times before I could reach the top. "My
                        legs seemed as though they could not support my body, and once when I got
                        out of bed I staggered and fell on the floor, remaining there helpless until
                        I was carried back to bed. I ate nothing, and people wondered how I kept
                        alive. You oan easily imagine what all this meant to me. In my weak state I
                        was quite unable to sit up and do my sewing, and my back seemed to be
                        breaking, and lights danced before my eyes so that I could not see what I
                        was doing Worn away to skin and bone, I gave myself up as lost. \ 'It was
                        just when all hope seemed gone that Dr. Williams' Pink -Pills for Pale
                        People were recommended to me, and thankful I am I tried them, for they
                        saved my life. It was a girl friend of mine who told me about them, and said
                        they had effected a wonderful cure in a cose known to her. "Although I had
                        no great faith in any medicine by this time, I bought a box of the pills,
                        and after a time I frit that they wore doing mo some good. I was soon able
                        to digest food, and my appetite improved every day. The boils began to
                        disappear as my blood was enriched by the pills, and before very long my
                        skin was dear I was no longer troubled with palpitation, and could run
                        upstairs without ( getting out of breath. I continued to use Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills until the change was so great in me that I needed them no more.
                        Now j I can sew as long as I like without feeling fatigued. In fact, my
                        health is fully restored and quite as good as it ever has been. I feel
                        certain that Dr. Williams' Pink Pills saved me from certain death " When the
                        Blood becomes thin and weak the nerves lose "tone" and the system rapidly
                        breaks down. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People ensure good health by

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>

                    <p>The Company has been formed to acquire the solo rights for Egypt and the
                        Sudan of the Clayton Process—the several uses of which may be briefly
                        described : — 1. (a) For Preventing and extinguishing fire on board ship by
                        rapidly generating "Clayton Gas" and forcing it under pressure into the hold
                        or compartment to be protected, (b) and reducing the temperature of the hold
                        or compartment in which a fire has been extinguished by circulating the
                        gas-laden atmosphere through the cooler, (c) and by the same process
                        reducing the temperature caused by the heating of any cargo. 2 For
                        Fumigating and Disinfecting, by charging any compartment with "Clayton Gas'
                        of sufficient strength to be germicidal. It has been proved that this Gas
                        has no injurious effect on any dry material, and the baccili of plague,
                        cholera, yellow' fever, diphtheria, and typhoid are among those that have
                        been destroyed in actual fumigations by this system. "Clayton Gas" also
                        sterilizes the infection of smallpox. 3. For Preventing heating of Cereals,
                        either in warehouses or ships'holds, by applying a sufficient strength of
                        "Glayton Gas" to sterilize the ferment germ, without affecting the
                        germinating properties of the grain. 4 For Exterminating rats, insects and
                        all vermin, such as cockroaches, bugs, fleas, ants, weevil, etc., that
                        infest ships, warehouses and stores Rats so destroyed come out of their
                        holes in search of air as soon as the pungent gas reaches them, and can
                        therefore be collected and disposed of without difficulty, the risk of
                        leaving dead vermin toputrify undiscovered being thereby avoided. "Clayton
                        Gas" destroys not only rats and vermin, but the parasites on them, and also
                        sterilizes the eggs of insects. With regard to its use for Fumigation,
                        Prevention of and extinguishing fire on Vessels, it is worthy of note that
                        the system has been adopted by the Norddeutscher Lloyd, The Ham'
                        burg-America Line, The Union Steam Ship Co. of New Zealand, the Pacific Mail
                        S.S Co. New-York, the Adam S.S. Co. Ltd Aberdeen. The Cie Sud American de
                        Vapores, Valparaiso the Pacific Steam Navigation Co., Liverpool, The British
                        India Steam Navigation Company, The Nippon Yusen Kaisha Co, fokio, and many
                        other shipping Lines too numerous to mention in this prospectus. The
                        importance of the Clayton system is recognised by the leading Insurance
                        Companies and L nder-W riters, who discriminate in favour of vessels
                        equipped with it, and, in numerous iustances, accept risks at a reduction of
                        premium provided the Clayton Appaiatus is installed Fumigat om avd
                        disinfection. — Dr. Calmette, Director of the Pasteur Institute at Lille
                        recommends the general adoption of the Clayton System at all
                        QuarantineStations with a view to the amelibration of existing Quarantine
                        regulations and as an effective means of preventing the introduction of
                        infectious diseases. Its adoption by the French Colonial Service, the Crown
                        Agents for the Colonies, the Governments of South Africa, Chili, Péru,
                        Ecuador, etc., affords sufficient evidence of the value of the system. Its
