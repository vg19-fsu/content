                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE UNREST IN THE FAR EAST. </head>
                    <p>Mr. Angus Hamilton has some interesting speculations as to what will happen
                        in the Par East when China and Japan really find themselves, the article
                        appearing in the third part of the "Harmsworth History of the World". </p>
                    <p>"Looking back at the conditions of Asia in the eighteenth shd nineteenth
                        centuries, and comparing them with those existing today, it will be noticed
                        that a wide a gulf separates Japan from China in the twentieth century As
                        then separated China from the rest of the Par East. On one side there is
                        Chins, anemotiofál, and only slightly irraptive; on the other there is
                        Japan, voicing the regeneration of Asia with raucous tones..... </p>
                    <p>"While China is commercially independent of the West, and Japan dependent
                        apon it, all branches of foreign industry cannot but view with alarm the
                        increasing aggressiveness of the spirit of independence now inspiring Asia
                        at the prompting of Japan. Obviously these signs are the indication of an
                        approaching cleavage between East and West, which, when tally attained, will
                        bear witness to the complete severance of the shackles bitherto enthralling
                        Asia to the interests and purposes of the West. </p>
                    <p>"It must not be forgotten that Japan already has achieved her complete
                        regeneration Thirty years hence China, no doubt, will have followed suit,
                        when federacy of the Far Eastern Powers may become an accomplished fact.
                        Byen it this moment such a union is possible, and its realisation would
                        impose upon all European Governments the immediate revision of their Asiatic
                        policies. </p>
                    <p>"At this time such a combination is hampered only by the unwillingness of
                        China to accept the suggestions of Japan in anything affecting the policy of
                        Asia, although, in spite of this objection, active reforming influences are
                        gre deally effecting important changes throughout the Chinese Empire. For
                        the momennt, therefore, Japan is content to tread alone the path she has
                        marked out, encouraging her subjects by example to exploit Asia for the
                        Asiatios, and to secure recognition of the doctrine of equality between the
                        white and Asiatic moes. </p>
                    <p>"If the full significance of this movement is not yet discernible, there is
                        enough evider to show that the problem will rank among the greatest that the
                        polities of the twentieth cen tary can disclose. Not only one part of the
                        civilised globe will be affected by the rise of dominant Asia, for the whole
                        world will be confronted equally with the necessity of resist ing whatever
                        indications may appear, If it is difficult to devise an arrangement short of
                        total exclusion that does not admit an annual influx of a large number of
                        Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Indian immigrants into the lands affected by
                        this invasion, it is at least tolerably certain that if the existing flow of
                        Asiaties across the Pacific to America and Australasia continues unabated
                        for further decade, the areas now menaced will be inhabited by a white
                        minority. </p>
                    <p>"It appears evident that the continuation of the Far East under existing
                        conditions is doubtful, if not impossible, in view of the awakening of Asia
                        and the visible prejudices that Western democracy entertains against the
                        Asiatio. Yet if the clash of conflicting interests ultimately precipitātes a
                        struggle between the two great racial divisions of the world, there can be
                        no doubt that the moral teachings of humanity will be discredited." </p>

                        world, every jealousy entertained by Chauvinists abroad will be transferred
                        to the counting house of every foreign manfacturing merchant. When once the
                        passion which protection or even preference will evoke has been let loose,
                        our present naval establishments, great though they be, will be insuficient.

                    <p>The late Judge Hills of Highhead Castle, Cumberland, the news of whose death
                        early on the morning of Monday, November 11th, will have been received with
                        keen regret by a large circle of friends and acquaintances, was born in
                        1837. He was the son of John Hills of Walmer, Kent, and spent his childhood
                        in Italy; from which circumstance he acquired that intimate knowledge of the
                        Italian language which he never lost, and which was of such value to him in
                        after life. At the age of 18 he went to Eton, afterwards going to Balliol
                        College, Oxford, where he graduated as B.A. in 1860. Upon leaving the
                        University he entered the profession of law, and was called to the bar in
                        1864. </p>
                    <p>For five years be filled the post of secretary to the Lord Privy Seal, (the
                        late Duke of Argyll) for which he was specially recommended by Dr. Jowett,
                        late Master of Balliol, on resigning this appointment he practised as a
                        barrister in London, and on the northern circuit till 1875. In 1863 he
                        married a daughter of the late Rt. Hon. Sir William Grove, P.C. F.R.S. the
                        distinguished scientist and Judge of the High Court.</p>
                    <p>In the summer of 1875 Mr. Hills was offered by Lord Derby, the then Secretary
                        of State for Foreign Affairs, the post of Judge in the newly constituted
                        International Tribunals in Egypt. This offer he accepted. In these Courts
                        Great Britain had the right of nominating two members of the judicial bench.
                        Mr. Hills' companion in this honour was Mr. John Scott (afterwards Sir John
                        Scott, Judicial Adviser to the Khedive.) In 1882 he was promoted to the
                        Court of Appeal in Alexandria, and retained his seat upon the bench of that
                        tribunal, a position which he occupied with unfailing dignity and
                        distinction, until his retirement four years ago.</p>
                    <p>In recognition of his long and valuable services he was invested by the
                        Khedive with the order of the Medjidieh, Judge Hills was a J.P. for
                        Cumberland, and well known in the county. For many years he rented Corby
                        Castle, the beautiful seat of the Howards of Corby upon the Eden: and upon
                        the completion of his official career he purchased from Lord Brougham the
                        fine old place, Highead Castle in Cumberland, which had been allowed to fall
                        into a derelict condition. This residence he restored with great taste and
                        judgment, and occupied it until his death. He is survived by his wife, and
                        his three sons; Major E. H. Hills, C.M.G., Royal Engineers, Mr. John Hills,
                        M.P., Durham City, and Mr. Eustace Hills, Barrister-at-Law.</p>

                    <p>The late Captain C.P. Roberts whose untimely death occurred this week, joined
                        the Egyptian Army on the 9th July 1901, and served for some time as
                        inspector in the Kor Hotan district prior to his appointment to the Egyptian
                        Artillery. Born in 1873 Captain Roberts was gazetted as second Lieutenant in
                        the Royal Artillery in April 1893, being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant
                        in April 1896 and obtaining his Captaincy in March 1900,</p>
                    <p>His early foreign service was divided between Gibraltar and India, at the
                        former of which places he had served in the Field Garrrison, and at the
                        latter in the Mountain Battery, while after his arrival in Egypt he served
                        in the operations at Jabel Jerok for which he received the Egyptian medal
                        with clasp. His Highness the Khedive at the same time conferred upon him the
                        order of the Medjidieh 4th class.</p>

                    <p>A correspondent writes :</p>
                    <p>A large number, if not the majority of the companies floated during last
                        season, are much hampered by the refusal of the shareholders to pay their
                        calls. I know many persons, who have refused, because they are quite unaware
                        as to the exact position of the companies. Nobody knows what the directors
                        are doing And as nothing is ever published as to what these companies have
                        done or are doing, there is naturally a disinclination to probably throw
                        good money after bad if the company is on the brink of voluntary liquidation
                        or, bankruptcy. Shareholders will not pay up in many cases unless the
                        directors issue a temporary balance sheet certified by auditors, giving full
                        details of how the company stands. Such an honest line of policy would lead
                        to many persons paying up all the calls due.</p>

                        this perfectly plain. The style is not particularly edifying; there is too
                        much much of the cit and thrust method about it, reminding one of
                        thosedendly obcounters, which only take place on the transpoutine stage

                        irratze of the prevailing conditions here, should do pouse the cause of
                        Kamel, seeing that he is the one man in Egypt who has proved himself apable
                        of conducting a campaign. But this beating of the big drum must neem, to
                        those who know, fulsome nonsense since the chances of evacuation are, by
                        reason of recent allianons more remote than they were ever before. </p>

                            is somewhat severely criticised. Your correspondent omitted to mention
                            &amp; rather im mortant fact in connection with the appearance of this
                            book. It is now several years since Arabi returned from exile to live in
                            this country, and ret not one Egyptian out of a thousand knows or cares
                            anything about him, and still leds about those whose tool he was in
                            1882. On hem all has fallen what the Prench pathetical y call "la pâle

                    <dateline>Le Caire, Jeudi 21 Novembre.</dateline>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres est renseigné invarié à 6 7/8 pour
                        cent.</p>
                    <p>Au Stook Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a balssé de 1/8 à 82. L'Unifide a
                        hausse de 1/4 99 1/4. Ia National Bank &amp; été soutenue à 20, l'Agricole à
                        7 7/8 et la Delta Light à 9 7/8. La Daina á rétrograde de 1/4 à 12 1/4.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyption a perda 1 trang à 678. La Banque
                        d'Athènes est restée inchangée à 108. Les Lots Tures ont gagné 1 fr. à
                        164.</p>
                    <p>Ici, notre marché privé d'un nouveau réconfort par suite des nouvelles
                        insignifiantes du marché anglais, est retombé dans le marasme dont il avait
                        essayé de sortir durant la séance d'hier. Après une ouverture assez bruyante
                        pendant laquelle on s'est payé le luxe d'un semblant d'animation, le calme
                        plat est revenu. L'approche de la cloture même n'a pas réussi à remuer nos
                        boursiers. Inutile d'insister sur • le peu d'importance des transactions, la
                        série de soubressats que nous venons de subir n'étant pas faite pour
                        encourager les achetours.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Etablissements de Crédit, l'Agricole fléchit à 7 13/16
                        alors que la National Bank reste in variée à 20. La Banque d'o. rient se
                        relève à 111-112. La Banque d'Es compte et de Reports se tasse à 2 9/16. </p>
                    <p>La Delta Light s'alourdit à 9 5,8. La Ramleh Railways tombe à 4. Les
                        Jouissances Baux du Caire reculent encore à 154-155. Le Crédit Foncier
                        Egyptien rétrograde á 675. L'Allot ment perd son avance d'hier à 1 15/16, de
                        même que ses fondateurs à P.T. 47. La Compagnie Immobilière hausse de 5 fos.
                        à 290. L'Agricole du Nil descend &amp; 180. L'AngloAmerican Nile se
                        consolide à 2 1/16.</p>
                    <p>Dans le compartiment des Hotels, les Nongovich perdent 1/4 8 15 3/4. Les
                        Baebler sont on nouveau recul 8 4 3/4-13/16 ainsi que les Upper Egypt à
                        25/8. Les Excelsior Hotels sont également plus faibles À 1 13/16.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, la Delta Land est ramenée à 1 1/4, les Markets à
                        25/- et les fondateurs Estates à 2 1/2. L'Ordinary Khedivial Mail est en
                        léger progrès à 20/9 et les fondateurs Express Nile Steamers sont en re
                        prise à P.T. 25. </p>
                    <p>Nous recevons de notre correspondant de Londres, en date du 15 courant, les
                        lignes suiYantes, concernant la tenue du groupe égyptien sur cette
                        place:</p>
                    <p>"La tendance est en général faible et les transactions difficiles et
                        restreintes. Sur les principales valeurs il suffit d'une demande ou d'une
                        offre relativement, en temps normaux, peu importante pour influencer
                        sensiblement les cours. On peut attribuer cet état de choses surtout à la
                        crise financière aux Etats-Unis qui provoque la hausse des taux de toutes
                        les Ban ques d'Europe et qui bouleverse toutes nos Bourses. Il est vrai que
                        la situation en Egypte nécessite la continuation de ventes pour assainir les
                        dossiers nantis, mais ces ventes auraient été sbsorbées avec facilité si la
                        situstion générale financière avait été favorable. </p>
                    <p>"Les taux de reports des positions de micourant à fin courant ont été dans
                        les environs de 8 % 11 %, et si la Banque d'Angleterre se voit obligé
                        d'avancer son taux actuel qui est de 7 %, les reports à la liquidation
                        prochaine deviendront très onéreux. Ce soir par suite de la continuation des
                        demandes d'or pour l'Amérique on craint d'un moment à l'autre l'élévation du
                        taux de la Banque à 8%.</p>
                    <p>"La National Bank a subi quelques fluctuations rapides, baissant à un moment
                        à près de 19 1/2 pour avancer plus tard à 20 3/8 et eldturer i 20 1/8.
                        L'Agricole avait baissé à un moment à 7 5/8, s'est relevée ensuite à 8 1/16
                        pour finir inchangée à 7 15/16. La Daïra de 12 1/4 s haussé à 12 3,4 pour
                        finir très faible ce soir à 12 1/4. Sur les petites valeurs les affaires ont
                        été pea importantes et la faiblesse prédomine." </p>
                    <p>Hier mstis s'est déroulé au Consulat d'Angleterre, Alexandrie, le prooes
                        intenté par un groupe d'actionnaires de la Bourse and Banking au Conseil
                        d'Administration. Le Tribunal a fait droit à la demande et n'a pas admis la
                        validité des règlements faits sur les titres de la Société qui ont été
                        négociés. </p>
                    <p>En ce qui concerne la nomination de M. A. Nahman comme liquidateur le
                        tribunal d'est déclaré compétent.</p>
                    <p>Il a été immédiatement interjeté appel de ce jugement par l'avocat de la
                        Société </p>

                            <p>Lord Charles Beresford, in a remarkable speech before the Salters
                                Company on the preparedness of the navy, concluded by remarking that
                                if any country prevoked war our practical preparedness would
                                pulverise it. He emphasised that it was not the battleships but the
                                human element which won. He pointed out Nelson's example. Nelson and
                                his captains, he said, were like brothers.</p>

                            <p>Lord Cromer, speaking at a banquet, illustrating the wisdom of Free
                                Trade as a basis of imperial policy instanced a clause in the Sudan
                                convention excluding trade preference. He also said that one reason
                                why he was able to do good work in Egypt and get Europe to acquiesce
                                to its continuance was the principles of Free Trade rigidly applied.
                                Once abandon them and our occupation of Egypt would be regarded very
                                differently. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>Uproarious scenes were witnessed yesterday at the trial of Signor
                                Nasi owing to the interruptions of Senators hostile to the accused.
                                Signor Nasi's counsel and the president exchanged strong language.
                                The counsel finally withdrew abandoning the defence. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>It is noticeable that the Minister of War is making numerous
                                inspections of garrisons, while the King is participating in various
                                military functions. It is believed that the army heartily supports

                            <p>The strike situation is becoming worse. The attitude of the European
                                strikers is threatening. Simla is isolated. A battalion of the

                                stranded passengers are collected. The Chamber of Commerce is

                        House, 27, Leadenball Street, E.C., 1st July, 1907, of which the Following
                        is the account : - Present - Reprementatives of: - Messrs. Barker and Allen,
                        Ltd., Baynes, E. Co, Blackwood and Co., Bourne and Railton, Cadbury Bros.,
                        Ltd., Colman, J. and J., Ltd., Compton, J. and Sons, Hoare, Marr and Co.,

                        Bros and Co.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. Steward Cox (Director of Egyptian Investment and Agency, Ltd.) was
                        voted into the chair. Mr. Cox said: I have no objection whatever to taking
                        the chair if it is the unanimous wish of the creditors that I should, but I
                        want to make it quite clear that we have no interest whatever in the matter
                        of the liquidation, and never have had any interest, except so far as we
                        could to safeguard the interest of the creditors, and if the meeting is not
                        unanimous I would rather not do it. Mr. Cox was unanimously voted into the
                        chair.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: I call upon Mr. Rowe, who acted as a member of the
                        Committee of Inspection in Egypt, to give some account of what happened
                        there. I think I will just again repeat that the Egyptian Investment and
                        Agency have no interest in this matter whatever, that my Company took up the
                        business of liquidating the Brown business in Egypt at the solicitation of
                        Mr. Brown, and we agreed to begin to see whether we could so liquidate the
                        business as in the interests of the parties concerned, and we here in London
                        heard nothing about it except that Mr. Brown had made that request. The only
                        thing that we did learn was from Mr. Hewett, one of our managers in Egypt--
                        who is present--that my company had the intention of liquidating the
                        business, without making any stipulation about remuneration, for account of
                        the concerned, in the hope of certain agency business resulting for us,
                        partly as a consequence of assistance which had been given to creditors, and
                        partly because my company believes that we can do credit to any business
                        when it is put in our hands</p>
                    <p>Letter convening the meeting was read. Mr. Rowe said as I happened to be in
                        Egypt at this particular time, I was put in the position of knowing perhaps
                        more about it than most of you, and therefore I give you some explanaion of
                        these affairs.</p>
                    <p>One or two letters I have received in reply to my letter convening the
                        meeting, complained that the recipients had received no previous
                        communication, and so, perhaps, it may be as well it I read to you the
                        letter which was sent,I prusame, to all the creditors by Messrs. Brown and
                        Co.</p>
                    <p>Since arriving home I have received another statement of affairs from Mr.
                        Brown, dated May 20th, giving his liabilities as Ps. 26,722,051, and assets
                        Ps. 2,220,720. In many cases, <cb n="3"/> however, the figures are not
                        correct, so this is of no use to us whatever. </p>
                    <p>The question being asked Mr. Rowe as to whether consignment stock could be
                        earnaked by the owner, he replied that was a question to be settled. </p>
                    <p>Apart from the list of sundry creditors in Mr. Brown's liabilities are the
                        two Banks, The Banque de Salonique Ps. 681,622, and Cassa di Sconto e di
                        Risparmio Ps. 416,415. These two Banks have got in all the Bills they could
                        get hold of; they are all drawn on Messrs. R Brown and Co's own Bill forms,
                        no matter whose goods they are against. The Banks are well covered for their
                        amounts, and when they are wiped off they will hand the Bills (balance) over
                        to the Liquidator, or Mr. Brown, or anybody duly appointed. With regard to
                        stocks beld in consignment, I can only tell you that in many cases part or
                        all have been sold and the money has gone into the Bank. I do not see how
                        you are going to separate one stock from another, or decide which Bill is
                        against which stock, as the goods of three or four creditors are lumped
                        together in many cases and all on one Bill </p>
                    <p>In reply to a question from Messrs. Morgan, Crossley and Co.'s
                        representative, Mr. Rowe said that we had no power to take possession of
                        anything, but that one member on the committee, Messrs. Rylands
                        representative, took possession of their stock, valued-I believe-at about
                        £4,000, and to which action I protested at the time. The representative of
                        Messrs Morgan. Crossely and Co., Ltd., said he would like to ask the
                        chairman if Messrs. Rylands were prepared to return those goods. </p>
                    <p>Messrs. Rylands' representative said that he had no instructions from Messrs.
                        Rylands, that we only knew of this matter an hour ago and could say nothing
                        at the present time pending instructions, but he could say Messrs. Rylands
                        would do the right thing. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Compton, of Messrs. J. Compton and Sons, said he would like to say that
                        he was present with Mr. Rowe in Egypt. The first thing suggested was that
                        Mr. Brown should be put through the Bankruptcy Court. They took both legal
                        and commercial advice, with the result that everyone strongly advised their
                        keeping out of the court. </p>
                    <p>It is of the greatest importance that something should be done at once; there
                        is stock here and money coming in, and no one has any authority to act on
                        behalf of the creditors, and that was the reason of calling this meeting.
                        Messrs Brown's books have not been audited for three or four years.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Compton said he very much doubted if Mr. Kerr (the Accountant) would take
                        the responsibility of a Deed of Assignment executed in his favour. Neither
                        could we (the Committee) take the responsibility of that Deed; and release
                        Mr. Brown of his indebtedness to us, and give him a free hand. We were
                        legally advised on the other side that when Mr. Brown signed that Deed we
                        had no further call on him. </p>
                    <p>Of course we had no control over sending these letters out, because we had no
                        idea who Messrs. Brown's creditors were, we simply signed the letters placed
                        before us. I think I shall give you a better idea of the state of affairs if
                        I tell you what happened in our own case (Messrs. Hoskins and Sewell), I
                        went out there on information received that things were not as they might
                        be. When I got to Alexandria I had a letter put before me, in which Mr.
                        Brown says, "that for various reasons, his managers leaving him, and one
                        thing and another, he will have to suspend payment for the time being, and
                        that he thinks it mpossible to carry on his business, and one of the reasons
                        he gives is the impossibility of finding an honest man in the country, and
                        so on." That is how I found the position when I got to Alexandria. The
                        letter was dated 3rd May, 1907. </p>
                    <p>Then I went immediately into the question with Mr. Brown with regard to our
                        accounts, and the stock we had in the country, and I asked Mr. Brown to let
                        me know how that stock stood. After several days, I found that out of about
                        £1,000 stock only about £100 remained unsold, and of this we had no advice
                        or cash. Then I went on to our outstanding accounts in the country, which
                        Mr. Brown collected as our agent, we paying him commision : and I found that
                        a large number of these accounts had been collected and the money had not
                        been remitted home, and the major portion of the remainder was covered by
                        Bills drawn on R. Brown and Co.'s forms. There were Bills which we had drawn
                        on him falling due at an early date, and I found there was no likelihood of
                        their being met at due date. This was at the beginning of May.</p>
                    <p>Then Messrs. Rylands' representative arrived, and also Mr. Compton, and their
                        cases I believe are identical with ours. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Brown promised us to make a statement of his affairs at the end of that
                        week. His statement when presented showed liabilities, £30,000, and assets
                        £28,000. But that statement was of very little use as it was found to be not
                        at all correct, and made up to March 30th only. </p>
                    <p>We three--Mr. Southworth, Mr. Compton and myselt--then formed ourselves into
                        a Committee of Inspection to protect the interest of the creditors, and went
                        to Cairo to inspect the stock and check it. Needless to say we did not find
                        it correct. Finding it was useless to rely upon Mr. Brown to give us any
                        true idea of his affairs, we consulted Messrs Russell, Kerr and Wyatt, of
                        Alexandria, Chartered Accountants, and asked them to examine Mr. Brown's
                        books and prepare a statement of affairs showing the position up to 20th
                        May, 1907. The report has not reached us yet. Mr. Kerr told me it would take
                        at least four to six week, ie, may be finished by the end of next week. </p>
                    <p>We thought, however, instead of waiting for this report, that it was very
                        necessary that the assets should be secured; we have absolutely no control
                        over Mr. Brown at the present time, and we think it is very necessary that

                        this meeting, and ask you to consent to the appointment of a liquidator. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Rowe was then asked if any other creditor had taken possession of their
                        goods, and replied that to his knowledge they had not. Messrs. Rylands took
                        possession about the 22nd. May. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that so far as he understood the matter, Messrs Rylands'
                        goods were there without any charge on them, and he believed they had every
                        justification for their action; but he expressed no opinion on the subject,
                        except to assure them that Messrs. Rylands would undoubtedly do what was
                        right. </p>
                    <p>The Solicitor of Egyptian Investment and Agency. Ltd. -- Mr. Leveaux--said
                        that Mr. Kerr had already refused to obtain a Deed of Assigament, and it was
                        highly necessary for the creditors to appoint somebody to represent them </p>
                    <p>It was then proposed that the meeting should be adjourned until the accounts
                        from the auditors had come to hand. Mr. Compton said that while these
                        matters were being discussed some provisional arrangements should be made,
                        and suggested that the Meeting should empower the Egyptian Investment and
                        Agency to protect ther interests. </p>
                    <p>After a good deal of discussion it was proposed by Mr. Payne, and seconded by
                        Mr. Kilner, that a cable be sent to Egypt to the accountants, to know if the
                        statement that has been mentioned had been sent off, or if not, when it will
                        be sent off, and that another meeting of creditors be called on the
                        information being received</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Rylands then agreed to submit the question of their retaining their
                        stock as mentioned above to arbitration, granted that they approved of the
                        arbitrator or counsel employed for the purpose. </p>
                    <p>It was then proposed by Mr. Compton, and seconded by Mr. Hoskins, that the
                        Deed of Assignment as drawn, appointing the Egyptian Investment and Agency
                        as Liquidators, be approved, subject to amendment by Messrs. Rylands'
                        Solicitors, and Messrs. Morgan, Crossley and Co.'s Solicitors, and Mr.
                        Leveaux the Egyptian Investment and Agency Co.'s Solicitor - on behalf of
                        the creditors, as to whether Messrs. Rylands' action in taking possession of
                        their stock could be legally justified or not. Messrs. Rylands undertaking
                        to hand back the stock or its value to the estate in the latter event, the
                        cost of arbitration being charged to the estate. This was carried
                        unanimously, Messrs. Morgan, Crossley And Co. not voting. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman said his company would send out the telegram asking about the
                        accounts and report. </p>
                    <p>The meeting was adjourned. </p>
                    <p>A reply to the cable has been since received from Egypt stating that the

                    <p>August 22nd. </p>
                    <p>Re Richard Brown &amp; Co. storekeepers, Alexandria and Cairo. A meeting of
                        creditors in this matter was held at Baltic House, LeadenWall Street, EC.,
                        on the 22nd ult, Mr. C. Stewart Cox, Director of the Egyptian Investnent and
                        Agency, Ltd., being voted to the chair. --The statement of affairs showed
                        liabilities £48,345, and assets estimated to realise £87,878, the latter
                        including book debts £31,120, stock on hand £3,667, cash £1,548, ind
                        investments £750. At a previous meeting the right of Messrs. Rylands and
                        Sons, Ltd., to have received a portion of their stock was challenged, and
                        agreed to be referred to Mr. E. W. Ansell, counsel to the Board of Trade,
                        whose opinion was subeequently given in Messrs. Rylands favour. </p>
                    <p>There are numerous creditors who have sent goods on consignment, some of
                        which have been sold, and the residue now forms part of the debtor's estate.
                        There are instances where a portion of the stock so consigned has been
                        disposed of to customers, and such sales have included the goods of numerous
                        firms, in one transaction, while bills appear to have been drawn by Richard
                        Brown and Co., and placed with their bankers or otherwise negotiated, so
                        that it will be seen it will be impossible to earmark goods which have been
                        so dealt with or where cash has been received in respect of goods sent on
                        consignment and not remitted, and it was felt that if such manufacturers
                        commenced proceedings for the return of any goods sent by them, litigation
                        must ensue, with the result that the state would have to <cb n="5"/> be
                        administered according to the Mixed Law prevailing in Egypt, which mean
                        protracted and expensive proceedings, and be disadvanageous to the
                        creditors. </p>
                    <p>It was suggested that the wisest course in this now would be for all to share
                        and share alike, and Messrs. Rylands and Sons, Ltd., have consented,
                        conditional on this course being adopted, to return the bills received by
                        them amounting to about £2,000 (retaining the goods they already hold). It
                        was therefore resolved that the creditors be recommended to assent to the
                        estate being assigned for the benefit of creditors, and that the Egyptian
                        Investment and Agency, Ltd., be appointed trustees, with a committee of
                        inspection ponsisting of four of the principal creditors, viz., Messrs.
                        Hoskins and Sewell, Ltd., Messrs. Raylands and Sons, Ltd., Messrs. J.
                        Compton and Sons, and Messrs John Shaw and Sons, Wolverhampton, Ltd., to act
                        with the Egyptian Investment and Agency, Ltd., and to assist in the
                        winding-up (the deed to be approved on behalf of the creditors), the
                        Egyptian Investment and Agency, Ltd., having agreed to undertake the work,
                        and without charge, if it is the unanimous wish of the creditors they should
                        do so. </p>
                    <p>The following circular was issued by Mr. G. G. Poppleton (Messrs. Poppleton
                        and Appleby), 4, Charterhouse Square, E C., on the 27th ult. :– "I beg to
                        inform you that the Committee of Inspection that was appointed in this
                        matter met here yesterday, when the following resolution was passed : That

                        one time the feeling was strong with a substantial advance in prices, there
                        being a feeling that financial matters in America were less acute, but later
                        there was less buoyancy and the Market reacted somewhat. </p>
                    <p>Bad weather was reported from the Cotton States, with Frost in some sections.
                        It is however too late for frost to do much injury, still it may stop
                        further growth. </p>
                    <p>There is, we think, a more confident feeling and many consider that Cotton at
                        about 5 ½ plb. is by no means dear if the monetary position in the United
                        States were in a more settled state. There is however almost a total absence
                        of outside speculation, the fluctuations of prices in the market being
                        merely due to the Room operators taking a view one side or the other for the
