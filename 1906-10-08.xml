                    <head>THE BARHR EL GHAZAL</head>
                    <p>Among all the enlightening episodes of the "scramble for Africa,'' then are
                        few chapters more suggestive than that relating to King Leopold's efforts to
                        extend his Congolese dominions into the basin of the Nile, and we recommend
                        our readers to persue a detailed history of thia episode, which appears in
                        the "Times'' of the 28th ult. For twenty years the King has carried on this
                        struggle with tenacious persistence, and it cannot be said to have ended
                        until the signature of the agreement between England and the Congo State
                        last May. But, prolonged and interesting as the struggle has been, it is not
                        very generally known, and the detailed account of it will accordingly be
                        welcome. We need not go through here all the intricate phases of the story.
                        It is enough to say that the ambitions which King Leopold conceived twenty
                        years ago, when the Congo State had just been founded and Mandism was
                        sweeping over the Sudan, have now been finally defeated. The Congo State
                        remains, it is true, in occupation of the Lado enclave, but, by the terms
                        under which thia territory was leased in 1894, the tenancy will last only
                        daring the lifetime of King Leopold. A permanent Congolese occupation of any
                        part of the Nile Basin, remarks the "Times," is now placed out of the
                        question once and for alL. The history of how, in 1894, we actually came to
                        lease to King Leopold Nile Basin, and how the squence of events and the play
                        of international forces rendered that agreement of no effect, ia a very
                        curious one, which deserves to be read in full. By the new agreement of 1894
                        is formally annulled - an exception being made only for the temporary
                        occupation of the Lado enclave, to which we have referred - and the Congo
                        State is definitely shut out from the Bhr el Ghazal. Thos who have followed
                        King Leopold's policy in the Congo will not be surprised to hear that the
                        Bahr el Gharal depends largely for its development rubber. This is the
                        reason, no doubt, why the Royal monpolist of the Congo rubber has been so
                        extremely anxious to ge into his hands. Time was when a liberal Government
                        was prepared to meet King Leopold half-way, and in 1894 a philanthropic
                        Foreign Secretary like Lord Kimberley could still announce that his
                        Majesty's "efforts to promote the civiliaation of Africa hare commanded
                        their warm sympathy." But a gohappened in the lapse of time, and the present
                        Government is better informed. It is, perhaps, undue assumption if we trace
                        tha Government's refusal to hand their fuller knowledge of the crying abuses
                        in the Congo. No other Powers are likely to object to their decision, since
                        the incorporation of the Bahr el Ghaial the Congo State would only have
                        meant the exclusion of all foreign trade and fair competition over a fresh
                        trade of African territory. The Bahr el Ghazal is to be congratulated on
                        having escaped a most unpleasant destiny. It is not very hard to guess what
                        its fate would have been, if it had been added to the rubber producing
                        districts of the Congo. Probably there would have been another great rubber
                        treat, on the Congo pattern, with the State, or the King, holding half the
                        shares. There would been the same enormous profits devoted, possible to
                        further purchases of the real estate in Belgium for the Crown domain.
                        Behhind all this, the same odious system would have been at work. Rubber
                        would have been wrung out of the wretched inhabitants by force, and, then
                        when more rubber was not forthcoming the lash and the rifle and the cannibal
                        native mercnaries would have been employed.</p>

                    <p>I have already written to acknowledge with grateful thanks the generous
                        donation of £1,030 from the Comtesse de Noailles in answer to your frequent
                        appeal for funds for bulding the English church at Khartoum-but I think it
                        may interest your readers to know a few details of the present position of
                        our Church Building Fund. On January 22 of this year we had the sum of
                        £3,257 in the bask, contributed during the past five years by residents and
                        visitors in Khartoum, as well as by friends in England. With the additional
                        donations which have come in during the present years this sum has increased
                        to nearly £4,000. The estimated cost of the church is between £8,000 and
                        £10,000. The plans have already been approved by the Church Committee, and
                        have been prepared by Mr, Schultz, the well-known accelesiatical arichitect.
                        With the sum now available the building (or which the foundation-stone was
                        laid by Princess Henry of Battenberg in 1904) is to be begun before the end
                        of this year, and it is hoped that all those interested the erection of a
                        church at Khartoum worthy our nation will generously come forward and help
                        complete the building, to the glory of God and to the memory of those who
                        have died at the post of duty.</p>

                    <head>THE ISIS ACCIDENT. <lb/>GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION.</head>
                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORESSPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>The accident which happened to the P. &amp; O. S.S. Isis, and delayed the
                        outward mail from Europe to the East, ocurred when the vessel was about 150
                        miles from Brindisi last Monday. The fact a appear to be these: In very
                        moderate weather the starboard tail shaft snapped and the propeller was
                        lost. This naturally caused the starboard engine to race for some few
                        seconds. The result was that one of the cylinder covers blew up and two of
                        the tables in the smoking room were to a certain extent shattered by the
                        concussion. There was no danger to the lives of any who were on board even
                        to those in the engine room. Steam was shut off once and in about 15 seconds
                        the racing ceased, butt not before a good deal of damage was done to the
                        engine in question. There was some leakage from the stern tube, but not
                        enough to cause anxiety to those on board. It was fortunate that the
                        accident happened when and where it did—a quarter before, noon, and only
                        some 70 miles from Zante.</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Suffolk appeared on the scene in response to telegrams, and her divers
                        were employed for several hours, but did not discover any serious damage to
                        the hull of the ship. It was decided that she could with safety proceed on
                        her voyage and she left trusting to the port enginge. An average of about 14
                        knots was maintained from Zante to Port Said and vessel arrived at her
                        destination soon after 2 p.m. on Saturday, and transferred her mail to the
                        Persia, which had been waiting since Tuesday last.</p>
                    <p>The fiction as to the vessel having gone on shore or touched the ground
                        anywhere is absurd.</p>
                    <p>For the present the Isis is quite bors de combat and repairs to the engine
                        will take some weeks.</p>
                    <p>A Passenger's Account.</p>
                    <p>The following account is furnished by a passenger:-</p>
                    <p>The BRindisi mail steamer left Brindiai with the Indian and Egyptian mails on
                        Sunday shortly after midnight, carrying about 60 passengers. Towards Monday
                        morning became rather rough, which caused the vessel to pitch considerably.
                        About 11 a.m. when near Cephalonia a tremendous explosion took place which
                        shook the vessel from stem stern with great violence, and it felt as though
                        she were going to pieces. The force of the concussion threw the smoking room
                        card tables into the air, smashing them to atms; the smoking room being
                        situated immediately above the engine room.</p>
                    <p>The Captain, third engineer, and the engine room staff had miraculous escape.
                        The Captain was standing close by at the time of the explosion. He at once
                        gave orders for the hosts be cleared, thinking from the report that serious
                        damage bad ben done to the hull which was only natural seeing that shaft and
                        propeller broken and fallen into the sea, and the cylinder had burst. Ther
                        was no panic whatsoever either amongst the passengers or crew; in fact the
                        Italian crew behaved splendidly. Mr. Turnball, the supernumerary third
                        engineer, who was in charge at the time, very bravely remained in his post,
                        and with great presence of mind rushed and closed the throttle valve and so
                        prevented the rush and escape of the steam, which otherwise would have
                        scaleded everyone in the engine room, which after the explosion was a wreck. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Kendall, the chief engineer, was quite equal to the occasion and managed
                        to keep the steamer moving slowly ahead with the remaining egine and
                        propeller, but the vessel was making water fast, and the after part of the
                        ship commenced slowly settling dow in the water. Captain Watkins, who was
                        quite alive to the situation, decided to steer direcr for the Island of
                        Zante, where the steamer arrived about dark. In the meantime pumping was
                        going on incesstantly, but the in rush of the water was gaining on the pump.
                        Once inside the harbour of Zante the pumps were in a better position to work
                        and therfore more efficaceous, and in this way they were able to keep down
                        the leakage.</p>
                    <p>Captain Watking at once wired for the assistance on board and on Wednesday
                        afternoon at 5 p.m. H.M.S Suffolk arrived from Malta.</p>
                    <p>The commander at once boarded the Isis accopanied by his chief-engieer and
                        chief carpenter, and shortly afterwards a large pentoon containing divers;
                        apparatus, a staff of blue jackets and four expert divers came alongside and
                        at once commenced operations assisted by the officers and engineers of the
                        Isis. They worked the whole of Wednesday night by the aid of electric light,
                        enabling the divers to see under the water. Operations were sucessfully
                        terminated on Thursday at 9 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Before the arrival of H.M.S Suffolk, the first officer, Mr. Cyril Brook, the
                        second officer, Mr. D.J Cornwall Jones, and the fourth officer, Mr. A.N
                        Gannery, successfully carried out the commander's plane for ascertaining the
                        damage, the two latter diving down under the ship's stern, where they
                        eventually succeeded in inserting a wooden plug of very large dimensions
                        into the hole caused by the breaking off of the propeller. Great praise is
                        due to these young officers, who voluntarily undertook this arduous
                        enterprise which was in reality the work of a trained and expert diver, and
                        the divers themselves expressed their admiration and suprise that such a
                        piece of work could have been done without the aid of a diving
                        apparatus.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>Everything was finished by Thursday morning and the Isis left Zante at 9.30
                        a.m. that day direct for Port Said, which was reached on Saturday, the 6th
                        inst., at 2 p.m., having steamed with one egine and propeller at a rate of
                        about 14 knots per hour. Fortunately fair weatehr was encountered all the
                        way from Zante.</p>
                    <p>It was only by the persistent efforts of captain, officers, and crew that an
                        appalling disaster was avoided, and it was the unaminous feeling of the
                        passengers that the P. &amp; O. Company should be proud of having such men
                        in their service. Great praise and admiration is due to Captain Watkins for
                        the energetic and prompt manner in which he carried out every thing
                        incidental to the accident, - and also to the officeres, engineers' staff,
                        and crew fo rtheir splendid co-operation throughout the whole incident.</p>
                    <p>Before reaching Port Said a testimonial was presented to Captain Watkins and
                        officers of the Isis signed by all the passengers expressing their
                        admiration praise and gratitude for the effective manner in which everything
                        had been carried out with a view on their saftey. The following is a copu of
                        the testimonial:</p>
                    <p>To Captain Wattins &amp; the Officers.</p>

                    <p>The following passengers on board the P. &amp; O. steamer Isis at the time of
                        the very serious accident to her machinery on the 1st October 1906 desire to
                        place on record their appreciation of the manner in which the Commander,
                        offciers, engineers, and crew of the shp have faced the difficulties of so
                        critical a situation.</p>
                    <p>We wish in the first place to express our sincere sympathy with Captain
                        Watkin and the chief engineer, Mr. Kendal, in the grave anxiety caused to
                        them by the disater, and trust that these officers wil reocgnize that it is
                        fully understood by all on board, both that everything possible was done to
                        secure the immediate saftey of the vessel, and also that when it was decided
                        to discontinue the voyage at Zante the great responsibility of determining
                        what action to take was in our opinion exercised I the wisest possible
                        manner. Further our best thanks are due to the Commander for the ready
                        manner in which the form time to time communicated to us all information
                        which teneded to relive our anxiety, and for the courtesy with which he has
                        meet acquires as to the prospects of continuing the voyage as soon as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>We wish to avoide reference to technical matters, but we are wll aware that

                        informed that it was through Mr. Turnball's bravey in remaining as he did at
                        his post at a moment of extreme danger, and to his presence of mind in doing
                        exactly the right thing at the right moment, that an appalling catastrophe
                        was avoided. </p>
                    <p>We also express our warm appreciation of the efficient manner in which
                        subsequent to our arrival at Zante, Mr. Brook, and those under him in
                        particular Mr. Cornwall Jones and Mr. Gunnery carried out the Commanders
                        plan for ascertaining the damage done and for temporarily remedying the more
                        serious injury to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The pluck and readiness of resource with which the work was done without the
                        assistance of trained divers cannot be too higly praised.</p>
                    <p>We offer our heartiest congratulations to Captain Watkins and all concerned
                        on the success with which their efforts were crowned, and trust that they
                        will look back with pride upon the incidents of a voyage which but for the
                        high standard of efficiency maintained on board the Isis might so easily
                        have been attended with far graver consequences.</p>

                    <head>LAUNCH OF THE GERMANIA.</head>
                    <p>Following on the launch of Nubis, which was reported in our columns a few
                        weeks ago, the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel Company, Ltd, launched
                        the Germania on Saturday afternoon. This second ship is still larger than
                        the Nubia, and will have accomodation for a hundred passengers. She has been
                        built to run in the new regular passenger service from Cairo to Assouan,
                        where she will connect with Nubia in conjunction with the well known
                        Victoria and Puritan, ans in conexiion with the Mayflower from laxor to
                        Assouan, and the Nubia from Assouan to Wady Halfs. She has an overal length
                        of 180 feet by 28 beam, and is fitten with compound surface condensing
                        engines of high power. LIke the Nubia, she has been fitted up regardless of
                        expense. The comfort and safety of the passengers has been astudied with
                        admirable care. Spacious state rooms will be unusually well got up;and
                        dinning and ladies' saloons and smoking room are well ventilated, and fitted
                        up in the excellent tase. As in the case of the Nubia, the forward portion
                        of the upper deck is arranged as a promande, and provided with a handsome
                        wind screen in which piste glass windows have been fixed so as to gurantee
                        the maximum protection combined with the fullest enjoyment of the view. In
                        conexion with both the Nubia and Germania, it may be remarked that the work
                        department of the Company have well sustained the reputation that they have
                        so deservedly earned, as the Nubia was launched only 3 weeks after the
                        arrival of the Material and the Germania two week later. </p>
                    <p>The Christening cermony was performed by Mrs. Diacono, wife of the manager of
                        the company, who broke a bottle of champagne over the bow of the boat, and
                        in a few well-chosen words wished the company and the vessel every success.
                        Many guests were present and after the cermony were entertained on board the
                        Nubia in the saloon of which tea and other refreshments were served.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir, - I presume the letter signed "Cantab" was only inserted by uou
                            as the comic side of the over-developed schoolboy corresondence now
                            taking place in your columns. "That's where the clown enters the
                            performance," I suppose. I presume the letter is written by one of the
                            public school fledinglings which we bring out from time to time to
                            continue their education, and which as a rule are gentlemen in the true
                            sense of the word, but you do come across these adopters of an attitude
                            they do not last many years out of England and in their colonies, wehre
                            they rapidly come with a solid bump on the ground and find their level.
                            This lad, however, is still boing over with the self-importance
                            carefully and fondly instilled into the darling child by mother before
                            he left her and her apronstring, to travel so far to the far distant
                            land, Egypt. I can hardly think that the writer of this letter ever was
                            a Cambridge, as I thnk he would at least have learnt that a member of
                            that University is usalyy considered a gentlemen, or at least he tries
                            to so conduct himself before the public. Well, "Cantab," I am an
                            Anglo-Egyptian official, I imagine senior to yourself considerablky in
                            years and position, and I must assure you that such an exhibition - to
                            adopt your own words - has aroused my irriation by your "patronising air
                            and condescening attitude" to that section of my fellow countrymen, the
                            commerical men, to whom I am in many cases proud to clai racial
                            relationship, and that your ignorant and conceited letter will be also
                            expensive, no doubt, unexpectedlu, to you at the hands of, aye

                        <p>SUCCESSFUL AQUATIC MEETING.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday afternoon the Alexandria Swimming Club held their fourth
                            annual aquatic sports in the new graving dock at Gabbsry, which has been
                            lent to them for the occasion. For this advantageous place of meeting
                            they were indebted to Gedge Pashs, deputy controller of the Ports and
                            Lighthouse Administration, who takes so kindly an interest in the
                            welfare of the Club, of which be is a vice president.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to the great energy with which the committee of the Club had
                            carried out the arduous duties of organisation arranged from every point
                            of view. The arrangement for the varied events were faultless and
                            ensured them being carried out without a hitch; the dock had been very
                            tastefully decorated with flags suitable to the international character
                            of the meeting; and the accommodation for the spectators buffets, under
                            the direction of Messers. Walker and Meimarachi Ltd., were provided, and
                            throughout the afternoon Mr. Hackmayer's orchestra played a
                            well-selected programme of music.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the successful organisation of the sports, and,
                            indeed, of the Club itself, we must mention the name of the
                            indefatigable honorary secretary and treasaurer, Mr. H. S. Martin, who
                            is an ardent devotee of the art of swimming, in the amateur world of
                            which he is so well-known as one of the most famous divers. It is the
                            main to his indomitable energy that the Club owes its existence and its
                            efficient organisation On his part, Mr. Martin can claim the loyal
                            support of a hard working committee ender the chairmanship of Mr. Walter
                            F. Sarjant, whose keen and active interest would be sadlu missed.</p>
                        <p>It is matter of congratulation to the Club that, though only started late
                            in 1903 with six members, they now have a roll call of 287. The work
                            which they have done in encouraging swimming among Alexandrians, and
                            especially the juniors, is higly laudable. The fact must not be
                            overlooked that many accidents have been avoided and lives saved by the
                            gift of swimming, and were the records of the Humane Society to be
                            examined they would be found to contain innumerable names of those
                            swimmers whose gallantry made them conspicuous. We are glad, too, to
                            notice that the Club is affiliated to the Royal Life and Saving Society
                            and Southern Countries Amateur Swimming Asssociation, England. Let us
                            hope that the efforts of the Club will encourage the Muncipality to
                            supply the long felt want of a suitalbe swimming bath, which could but
                            prove splendid investment for the town.</p>
                        <p>To revert to the sports themselves. A very wide interest had been taken
                            in the meeting by the residents of Alexandria, and we under stand that
                            the sale of tickets constitated a record. The attendance, however,
                            though large, was somewhat reduced by the Alexandria Sporting Club
                            having fixed the same afternoon for the sixth Skype Meeting. We cannot
                            pretend to give names, as it would be invidious to mention only some of
                            the many of Alexandria's Society who were present, and want of space
                            forbids us recording all. We must content ourselves with remarking that
                            both the official world including H.E the Governor, and the civil world
                            were very well represented.</p>
                        <p>The programme, as we have already mantioned, was excellently arranged,
                            and greater interset than in former years was attached to it by the
                            inclusion of an invitation team race, in which the Alexandria Bowing
                            Club Internazionale Canottiari were indisposed and necessitated the
                            screatching of the team. The great event of the meatting was, naturally,
                            the race for the much coveted medal presented by Sir Reginald Wingate
                            Pashs, four which there were twenty entries. The four heats were all
                            well contested and, though in three of these the limit man came in
                            first, and in the remaining heat the winner was only handicapped one
                            second against the "scratch" handicap of eighteen seconds, they were
                            sufficently well contested to exponerate the handicappers of the charge
                            of misjudgement. The sixty yards juniors handicap saw six boys compete,
                            and their performances showed what good the club is doing in teaching
                            young boys to swim; the diving too, of these youngsters was very
                            creditable. The obstacle race and walking the pole in costume caused
                            great merriment and in the former it was remarkble with what ease the
                            obstacles were negotiated. In the latter, the arch round of clown, a
                            terrifying Red Indian, a grod, a grotesque nondescript, and Captain
                            Kettle, with a very laky Mephistofeles n the rear, introduced the comic
                            element. Mr. Martin's independent diving exhibition was very warmly
                            applauded.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the sports the prizes were given away by Mrs. H. F.
                            C. Parkinson, the wife of the popular general manger of the Khedivial
                            Mail Steamshup and Graving Deck Co, Ltd. Mr. Sarjeant, in a short and
                            pithy speech, thanked all those who had given their support to the Club
                            by their present at the sports, and by their independent interest in its
                            welfare. He desired especially to record the inexpressible apprecuation
                            of the Club at the Earl of Cromer's continued presidency, which could
                            but have great beneficial efforts and encouragement to its members. To
                            Gedge Pasha and Gritton Bey they were indebted for the loan and
                            arrangment of the dock, and he would thank them most heartly. He wouls
                            also like to record the generosity of that great sportsman, Prince Aziz
                            Hassan, one of the vice presidents, in providing a handsome silver
                            challenege cap for the 220 yards Club Championship, which will be
                            competed for on the 20th inst. </p>

                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>To Mr. Montagu Summers they were much indebted for the silver challenge
                            hield for the 410 yards Club Champoonship to be sawm fro on the 27th
                            inst. at Ras-el-Tin. Their gratitude was also due to Mr. A. R. Paurvis
                            for the great pains he had taken in to tastefylly decorating the dock
                            and arranging the details. He would thank Mrs. Parkinson for having so
                            kindly consented to distribute the prizes, but wouls remark that she had
                            forgotten one - that with the Club desired to offer to her as a memento
                            of the ocassaion, and he then presented her with a silver card case and
                            bonquet of flowers. Mr. Parkinson responded on behalf of his wife, and
                            in expressing the great pleasure with which they attend to successful a
                            meeting, and in wishing the Club every success, voiced opinion of all
                            present.</p>

                            excellently, and indeed the performance as a whole was very creditable
                            to the juniors. Special mention might be made of S., Bent's a lad of

                            fro spring board. Won by A. A. Ecceleston,e with E. A. Darton 2nd, and
                            F. E. Howard 3rd. The diving was very keenly competed, the winner only
                            leading half a piont above the second, who in turn was only separated by
                            the same value from the third man.</p>
                        <p>Event XI. - Obstacle Race. Three prizes presented by the Staff of the
                            Eastern Telegraph Company, Limted. Won by C. H. Classpole, with H. Vogel
                            2nd , and J. Broscombe 3rd. The obstacles consisted of a heavy pole
                            stretched across the bath, barrels, through and under which competitors
                            had to pass, and life-buoys.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>Very few of the competitors bungled the obstacles, the barrels being in
                            most cases very netaly negotiated, notwithstanding their narrow girths.
                            Glasspole is to be congratulated on his fin win, as Vogel was over the
                            pole on the return journey first, but was overtaken in the short space
                            of yards by the winner, who beat him by a bare touch.</p>
                        <p>Event XII. - Walking the Pole. Two prizes wre given for this event,
                            namely, one for obtaining the flag and one for the best costume. The
                            rpize for obtaining the flag was gained by C. S. Scarth, who was also
                            very well-constumed as "Captain Kettle." A. A. Ecclestone won the
                            costume prize, being excellently got up as a frog. This contest caused
                            great amusement to all present and certainly guranateed its repetition
                            in furture years.</p>
                        <p>Event XII. - Tug of War. Prize for each member of winning team. This
                            event should has been contested by military teams, who, indeed, arrived
                            on the scene, but not being provided with costumes and none being at
                            liberty, they were disqualified. Their places were taken by teams
                            captained by L. H. Rickards and C. S. Scarth. Both teams pulled very
                            evenly, but Rickard's team proved the best stayers and pulled their
                            opponents over the line after a good struggle. There should also have
                            been a military pole match, but this had to be cancelled on account of
                            lack of costumes.</p>

                        <p>SKYE MEETING.</p>
                        <p>The September Skype Meeting of the A. S. C., which had been postponed
                            from the 29th ulto., was held on Saturday last in splendid weather.
                            Notwithstanding the counter-attraciton of the Swimming Club's meeting at
                            Gabbari, there was fair attendance of the public, and a very enjoyable
                            afternoon's sport was provided. The racing was good as we have seen at
                            any Skype Metting. The most notable event of the afternoon was the
                            victory in the Autumn Stakes of Sultan, belonging to H.H. Prince Mar
                            Tousscun. This fine colt, although left standin at the post over 10
                            lengths behind managed to win the race in a canter. The victory was a
                            very popular one, both in the enclosure and paddock, and the sporting
                            Prince received the congratulations of all. It is to be hoped that this
                            is the prelude to a run of luck for his Highness, who is one of the best
                            supporters of the Turf in the country. The banf of the Royal Dublin
                            Fusiliers rendered a choice selection of music during the afternoon. The
                            following were the results of the racing: -</p>

                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
