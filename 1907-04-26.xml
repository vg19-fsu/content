                                7th May. It is understood that the Bill will establish a Council in

                            <p>The "National Gazette," commenting on the news published in the
                                "Standard" regarding the bank agreement between Germany and Persia,
                                says that according to information received from an authoritative
                                source, no agreement has been concluded between Herr Stemrich,
                                German Ambassador at Teheran, and the National Bank of Persia.
                                However, it has been recognised for a long time that the Deutsche
                                Orient Bank is extending its sphere of activity in Persia and its
                                representative has actually started for Teheran, but until his
                                arrival, the Bank cannot enter into any relations with the Persian
                                Government. </p>

                        <p>Yesterday morning a man of the coastguards at Sid Kreen, Mariout, was
                            found to have been shot dead Enquiry proved the fact that he had been
                            shot by a fellow coastguard with whom he was on bad terms, and the

                        <p>A terrible accident through the manufacturing of fireworks occurred at
                            Cairo yesterday afternoon in the Fagallah quarter. A native workman was
                            engaged in the factory when a violent explosion of gunpowder occurred
                            and the man was hurled into the air and fell to the ground headless, his
                            head being after­wards found some fifty metres away on a balcony. The
                            explosion was followed by a fire and it was discovered that four little
                            girls had been buried by the debris and burned to death.</p>

                            year 1906 the Disconto-Gesellschaft of Berlin (with branches in London,
                            Frankfort o. M. and Bremen) distributes a dividend of 9%, this being the
                            same rate as for 1905, against 8 1/2% for the three previous years. The
                            capital of Ml70,000,000 and Reserves of M 57,600,000 remain unchanged.

                        <head>AN INTERESTING CASE.</head>
                        <p>This morning the hall of the Appeal Court of the Mixed Tribunal at
                            Alexandria presented a very animated appearance, for it was crowded with
                            a large number of persons, who came to assist at the trial brought
                            before the Italian Consulate by Mr M. Hernztein against 68 Italian
                            subjects. These were accused of having signed a pamphlet charging the
                            plaintiff with having given information which led to the arrest of the
                            three Russians concerned in the recent affair which caused such
                            commotion</p>
                        <p>Among the defendants were several nota­bilities of the Italian community
                            among whom we noticed Drs. De Semo, Camerini, Protano, Calzolari and
                            Salama. The inquiry lasted throughout the morning. All the defendants
                            replied to the charge of defamation that they simply exposed facts in
                            the brochure referred to in order that full light might be thrown up— on
                            the case of the three Russians. All declared that they knew Mr.
                            Hernztein by reputation only and that the charges were of public
                            notoriety.</p>
                        <p>The Consular Court consisted of Falqui Cav. President, Com Manusardi and
                            L Stagni, judge-assessors, Maltres Padoa Bey, Colucci, and Luzzato were
                            tor the defence, and Maltre Volpini represented Mr. Hernztein, who
                            ap­peared as "partie civile." The latter did not appear tin's morning,
                            on the grounds of illness and at half past eleven the Court sent an
                            usher with a doctor to confirm the plea of ill­ness. At the conclusion
                            of the audience plain­tiffs counsel withdrew the charge against 22 or
                            the defendants, thereby losing the case against the others according to
                            Italian law. The counsels for the defence asked the Court to take note
                            of the partial withdrawal of the case. The Court rose at midday and will
                            sit at four o'clock this afternoon.</p>

                        <head>FIRST SUMMER MEETING.</head>
                        <p>Yesterday was the first day of the first summer meeting of the Alexandria
                            Sporting Club for this season, and a good afternoon's racing was
                            witnessed though not under the best auspices. The cloudy morning was
                            fortunately followed by a bright afternoon, but the wind was very chilly
                            and as the attendance was poor the afternoon was distinctly "flat" Let
                            us hope, however, that tomorrow the elements will be more kindly. From a
                            racing point of view there was little fault to be found, the running
                            being good and both riders and horses keen. A well-run event of the
                            meeting was the race for the Municipality Chip which was secured by
                            Batty on Jupiter for Messrs. A. J. Sursock and AJ Michaelidis in
                            splendid style There were only three entries and the contest was very
                            keen, Sadik leading the first round to be overhauled by Valentino at the
                            commencement of the second round, and Valentino in his turn was run down
                            by Jupiter, though not until the race was nearly finished The Galloway
                            Plate, too, was very well run, the prize of P.T. 5,000 going to Khalil
                            Pasha Khayat with Suleik, Jenkins up. The race for the Continental
                            Stakes excited the greatest interest as it was one of the most important
                            races ever run in Egypt- The race was for class 1 and 2, meaning English
                            thoroughbreds or first class Egyptian country-breds. No less than
                            sixteen English thoroughbreds were entered for the race and although

                            how far the native police can be trusted in the case of any emergency
                            When the cab strike was on I was looking out of my office window net far
                            from the Telegraph Buildings in the Boulac- road. I noticed a European
                            driving in a cab pursued by a number of low class natives, mostly
                            youths. Several shawishes were in the immediate vicinity making a feeble
                            pretence of protecting the cab and a patrol of mounted police with two
                            officers were galloping to the cab's assistance and at that moment were
                            about eighty yards from the cab. An Arab just then hurled a heavy lump
                            of stone which narrowly missed the head of the European in the cab. It
                            was sobig that if it had hit him the blow might easily have proved
                            fatal. Any of the foot police could easily have arrested the man. But on
                            the contrary they flagrantly allowed him to escape up a side street so
                            as to avoid the mounted policemen, who, be it noted, had European
                            officers with them. The European occupant of the cab jumped out of it
                            and took refuge in the Telegraph Buildings and the cab returned under
                            the protection of the mounted police. Ten minutes afterwards when die
                            crowd had dispersed, the man, who had thrown the stone, was talking and
                            laughing with the two shawishes on the very spot where re had committed
                            the outrage.</p>
                        <p>There can be no doubt from this and similar instances which have occurred
                            in Cairo of late, that the native police cannot be depended upon if
                            unaccompanied by European officers or non-commissioned officers This
                            incident emphasises the necessity of the large and immediate increase of
                            the European element an all the police forces in the chief cities of
                            Egypt. </p>

                        <head>REMARKABLE DISCOVERY</head>
                        <p>Some very interesting discoveries have just been made at the works now
                            being carried out in order to extend Victoria House, opposite the
                            British Consulate at Alexandria. Here was the supposed site of a great
                            palace of the Ptolemies and while digging the foundations of the new
                            building, Mr. Williams, the architect, was told by the workmen that the
                            mouth of a mysterious opening in the ground had been, found at a depth
                            of three metres below the surface. He ordered the opening to be cleaned
                            out and then made his way into the cavity. He found after descending to
                            the depth of five metres a large and well-built passage excavated in the
                            sand stone rock. It extended f6r fifteen metres and was high enough to
                            admit of a man penetrating into it standing upright At the end of this
                            long passage a chamber was discovered, three metres in width and twelve
                            metres in length. This room communicated with another of the same size
                            and in a corner of the further chamber some steps cut in the solid rook
                            were discovered. This stair­case communicated with the innermost chamber
                            which was evidently an ancient burial place, for niches for lamps were
                            ranged along the walls over which ran what appeared to be a Greek
                            inscription, bat owing to the ruined state of the characters it is as
                            yet indecipherable. The architect, Mr. Williams intends to make plans of
                            this curious discov­ery. Meanwhile an opening has been left in the
                            foundation walls from which access may be gained at any time. Anyone,
                            who wants to explore these subterranean relics of the an­cient city,
                            will have to get down by rope.</p>
                        <p>There is every probability that these passages and chambers are merely
                            the prelude to a series of an underground network of commu­nications,
                            which honeycomb, as is well-known, the greater part oi the modern city.
                            Up to now there are many passages which have not as yet been penetrated
                            in this neighbourhord.</p>

                    <dateline>Le Caire, Jeudi 25 Avril 1907.</dateline>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres a encore fléchi de 1/8 à 3 1/8 pour
                        cent. Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a regagné 1/8 à 85 7/8;
                        L'Unifiée est restée invariée à 102. La National Bank a perdu 3/8 à 24 et la
                        Daïra 1/4 à 15 1/2. L'Agricole est demeurée inchangée a a 8 3/4 et la Delta
                        Light à 10 1 2.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyptien a reculé de 4 francs à 723. La Banque
                        d'Athènes a avancé do 1 franc à 124.</p>
                    <p>Ici, le marché a été aujourd'hui ce qu'il fut hier, c'est-à-dire à peu près
                        nul. II y a eu une trentaine de transactions enregistrées, qui ont été
                        naturellement pratiquées aux cours de compensation fixés le 12 Avril courant
                        et mo­difiés en légère partie le lendemain. Comme il est interdit de vendre
                        au-dessous de ces cours, il devient manifeste qu'il y a encore des
                        ache­teurs, ou bien qu'on se couvre aux prix indi­qués, ce qui est, sans
                        conteste, rassurant.</p>
                    <p>Au reste, la situation générale du marché nous disons la situation du marché
                        et nen la situation d'aucuns — n'a jamais été alarmante, encore qu'elle ait
                        donné lieu, comme partout, à des inquiétudes légitimes à la suite de la
                        récente crise universelle.</p>
                    <p>Aussi bien, en présence de la stagnation qu'elles déterminent, on est porté à
                        contester l'opportunité des mesures extraordinaires prises pour enrayer la
                        baisse, ou plutôt pour contre­carrer les manceuvres des baissiers. On
                        allègue que ces mesures pourraient être mal interpré­tées à l'étranger et
                        jeter le discrédit sur le marché égyptien. On cite à l'appui les ordres de
                        vente transmis d'ici qui ont eu, hier encore, une fâcheuse influence sur les
                        cours de la Na­tional Bank, de la Daïra et du Crédit Foncier, à fondras et à
                        Paris. On en conclut que le système " du laisser faire, du laisser passer "
                        vaudrait mieux que les restrictions imposées, restrictions qui pourraient
                        faire supposer in justement que le marché égyptien est endan­ger, d'autant
                        pins que lefond de baisse est plus ou moins atteint, qu'il n'y a pas, en
                        tout cas, à appréhender de fortes dépressions addition­elles ; que beaucoup
                        de titres pourraient même bénéficier d'une reprise si l'on revenait au
                        régime libre, etc. </p>
                    <p>Nous nous bornons, pour notre part, à ex­poser ces observations. Elles
                        méritent d'être sérieusement étudiées par les promoteurs de " l'essai loyal

                        intentions du monde et il n'a nui jusqu'à présent à aucun intérêt
                        parti­culier, ce qui n'est pas peu dire. Quelques amendements immédiats, de
                        nature à pérmettre reprise des affaires, suffiraient peut-être à rendre
                        conforme à l'intérêt général.</p>

                    <p>" Au Stock Exchange, la semaine a été en­core très inactive pour les valeurs
                        égyptiennes; mais la tendance, qui était faible dans les pre­miers jours,
                        s'est quelque peu améliorée depuis hier. La plupart des ordres reçus
                        d'Egypte sont restés inexécutés et les cours sont nominaux pour l'instant,
                        les transactions devenant de moins en moins nombreuses et les affaires de
                        plus en plus difficiles.</p>
                    <p>" Les Estates ont baissé jusqu'à £ 1 11/16 pour remonter à 1 7/8 et clôturer
                        ce soir à 1 13/16 ; leurs parts de fondateur ont été échangés à £16. Les New
                        Egyptian ont été absolument calmes et plutôt faibles malgré la nouvelle de
                        la vente du domaine de Matins J'apprends à ce sujet que la Compagnie se
                        propose de répartir À bref délai un dividende de 12 1/2 pour cent, soit 2
                        sh. 6 par action. Les United Lands ont baissé à £ 0 7/8 pour re­monter au
                        pair et clôturer à 0 15/16.</p>
                    <p>" La Banque d'Angleterre n'a pas abaissé son taux d'escompte cette semaine ;
                        mais on s'attend à ee qu'elle le réduise bientôt à A % en présence des prix
                        de 3 1/2 pour cent et au-dessous qui se pratiquent sur le marché libre.

                        lord Cromer des hautes fonctions qu'il remplissait depuis si longtemps et
                        d'une façon si remarquable en Egypte n'a affecté en rien les rentes
                        égyptiennes, car le Stock Exchange est persuadé que l'oeuvre ac­complie par
                        cet homme l'Etat est suffisamment solide pour se maintenir et porter ses
                        fruits sans l'appui de la présence personnelle de son auteur. L'Egypte est
                        engagée dans la voie de la prospérité ; rien ne menace de l'en faire

                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company Ltd., was held on Tuesday the 18th inst., a Winchester House, Old
                        Broad-street, EC., Sir Auckland Colvin, K.C.S I., K.C.M.G., C I E (the
                        Chairman of the company), presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) having read the notice convening the
                        meeting,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : Gentlemen,-.When we met on the 19th July last year
                        certain alterations in the memorandum and articles of association of our
                        company were put before you for your consideration and approval, and were
                        subsequently passed and confirmed at the general meeting held in August. At
                        that time then was a proposal before our company to amalgamate with the
                        Egyptian Land and General Trust Company, and in order to carry that proposal
                        into effect we were informed by our legal advisers that it would be
                        necessary to alter the terms of our memorandum of association so as to
                        extend the area of our operations which was at that time limited to the
                        Delta as we are aware the proposal to acquire the Egyptian Land and General
                        Trust Company fell through, but though the same actual necessity did not
                        exist, it was still deemed desirable to proceed with the alteration to this
                        memorandum, and an application was duly made to the Courts to obtain their
                        approval to such proposed alteration The order of the Court, which reached
                        us in January of this year, was to the effect that before any change in the
                        memorandum of association could be sanctioned the name of the Delta Land
                        Company must be altered Meanwhile, the rail way company had sold their
                        shares in the land company, as not being authorised to hold shares in
                        another company having such extended objects, and so much of this articles
                        of the Delta Land Company as provided for the participation of the Delta
                        Light Rail ways on their Board; and in their affairs, has been cancelled,
                        and in pursuance of the revision of the articles sanctioned by you, the land
                        company became an entirely independent body, and its connection with the
                        railway company was put an end to. On learning the order of the Court, it
                        was ascertained by me, being at that time in Egypt, that most of the
                        share-holders of the land company, a large majority; of the shares of which
                        are held in Egypt, were entirely adverse to the change of name of our
                        company, believing that it would be injurious to its credit and stability.
                        As the proposal for the acquisition of the Egyptian Land are General Trust
                        Company had fallen through the more urgent necessity of altering the
                        memorandum of association no longer existed (the company proposing mainly to
                        confine it operations in future to the neighbourhood of Cairo), and I was
                        urged to take no further action in the application before the Court ; at the
                        same time it was intimated to me that, in view of the changed circumstances,
                        it was, as far as could be ascertained, the unanimous; desire of the
                        shareholders of the land comped in Egypt to revert to the status quo ante,
                        an to reestablish the connection which had existed between it and the
                        Egyptian Delta Light Railways prior to the negotiations which led up to the
                        meeting of 20th July. I am, as you are probably aware, also the Chairman of
                        the Egyptian Delta Light Railways, and I ascertained that the wishes of the
                        shareholders of the land company coincided with that of the Egyptian section
                        of the Board of the railway and subsequently, on my return to England the
                        assent of the London section of the railway Board was accorded to the
                        proposed reversion to the former connection between the two companies.</p>
                    <p>CONSTITUTION OF THE BOARD.</p>
                    <p>You are probably aware that by the original articles of association of the
                        land company, to which it is now proposed to revert, four of the seven
                        members of the Board of the land company must be directors of the Egyptian
                        Delta Light Railways, should they be willing to take their seats on the Land
                        Board. Now the whole business of the land company is of an exceptional
                        nature. It is concerned solely with local transactions in the purchase of
                        land and buildings in Egypt, of the merits of which the London section of
                        the Railways Board is necessarily, to a great extent, imperfectly informed
                        It needs no such expert advice or technical assistance in London as is
                        required, for example, by such an enterprise as a railway or a steamship
                        service. So long as the two companies were associated, constant references
                        between the members of the land company in Cairo and the London directors of
                        the railways, sitting on the Land Board, have nevertheless been found
                        necessary, and the London members were put to disadvantage by their want of
                        intimate acquaintance with the conditions existing in Egypt and consequently
                        with the merits of the policy as of the several propositions from time to
                        time put before them. Considerable delay has been thus caused, and the
                        affairs of your company necessarily suffered ; the more so that, as you are
                        aware, great competition exists in Egypt in regard to the purchase of land
                        and building and decisions have often to be taken at brief notice, or
                        valuable properties may be lost. When, therefore, the question of
                        re-association between the Boards of the two companies can before the
                        Railways Board, it was unanimous! agreed that it would be more in the
                        interest of the land company, as of the railways, whir holds a considerable
                        number of shares in the land company, that the representatives of the <cb
                            n="2"/>railways on the Land Board should be members of the Egyptian
                        section of the Delta Light Railways Board and not of the London section of
                        the Board. The Egyptian members of the Railways Board have every means of
                        adequate­ly informing themselves of the several propo­sals put before the
                        Land Board, and, unlike the London members of the Railway Board on the Land
                        Board, are as cognisant of the merits of the various questions from time to
                        time sub­mitted to them us are the members in Egypt of the Land Board
                        themselves. By a parity of reasoning it is evident that in the interests of
                        the land company, the members of the Land Board should also be resident in
                        Egypt. If, then, members of the Land Board, whether they were members
                        sitting as delegates for the railways or members of the Land Board proper,
                        were to meet in future in Cairo, it followed that it would be necessary for
                        the conduct of that business that all future meetings, of whatever kind,
                        should be held in Cairo, and that the business of the land company should be
                        transferred to Egypt, the company remaining meanwhile a British company,
                        having in London the registered office and a secretary, but in all other
                        respects transacting its business in Cairo, and not in London. There was the
                        less objection to this course being pursued, in that the Delta Land Company
                        has no debenture debt in London, and there could, therefore, be no objection
                        anticipated on behalfof debenture holders, who otherwise might justly have
                        regarded transfer of control to Egypt as an infringement of the conditions
                        in which they had placed their funds at the disposal of the company.
                        Resolutions one and two are drawn with a view to reverting to the old
                        connection between the land company and the railway company. Resolution
                        number three is with a view to transferring the management and direction of
                        the business of the company to Egypt. This is all I have to say with regard
                        to this branch of the subject You will understand, I think, from what I have
                        said that the links between the two companies which were severed in July
                        lastwill now, with your approval, be reconstituted; that the Delta Light
                        Railways will, as before,</p>
                    <p>continue to have four seats, should it wish to claim them, on the Delta Land
                        Board, but that the Land Board so reconstituted will in future meet in Cairo
                        and not in London and that its business will be carried on wholly there,
                        while it remains itself a London company, with a registered office and
                        secretary in London.</p>
                    <p>THE PROPOSED CAPITAL INCREASE.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the proposed increase of capital, which is dealt with by
                        Resolution IV., it is necessary to explain to you that the land company have
                        before them a project for acquiring a considerable area of land lying
                        between Cairo and Helouan, in the immediate vicinity of a valuable and
                        larger tract already acquired s by them in previous years. Both properties
                        are known as the Meadi properties. The object of the company is to round off
                        the whole of these two properties and to convert them into residential
                        properties, in the belief that such sites will be largely in demand by
                        residents in Cairo and that the sale of the several lots of which have been
                        and are being already divided will be of considerable value to the company,
                        it Some progress has already been made in the sale of sites on the Meadi
                        land previously is accquired by the company and negotiations are now pending
                        with a group who own the balance of land above referred to for acquiring
                        their property It may be of interest to you to know that when I was recently
                        in Egypt I inquired personally into the merits of the project to which I
                        refer and satisfied myself that, so far as can be ascertained, in the
                        present condition of affairs in Egypt, where much building and land
                        speculation is rife, the Meadi property, which is situated on the Light
                        Railways, a few miles from Cairo, on the line of railway to Helouan, fulfils
                        the conditions which are necessary to make it a popular suburb of Cairo. I
                        understand that a very competent general manager has been appointed by the
                        land company since I was there to carry out without delay the measures
                        necessary to hasten the development of the Meadi prop­erty and that members
                        of the Land Board as so about to be constituted are sanguine that the
                        enterprise will be very successful and are prepared to devote to it the care
                        and energy in which characterise them. You will gather from what I have said
                        that, in common with the other London members of the Land Board, as
                        reconstituted in July last, I must necessarily tender my resignation so soon
                        as you have given your sanction to the proposals now put before you and a
                        confirmatory meeting has been held to ratify them.</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>THE PROPOSAL STATED BRIEFLY.</p>
                    <p>Let me repent in a few words the substance of what I have said. My colleagues
                        and I, in agreeing to put the matter before a general meeting in London,
                        have been largely guided by the fact that the majority of the capital ,
                        invested in this company has been subscribed in Egypt : that there is no
                        debenture debt held in London : that by far the greater part of the
                        shareholders are resilient in Egypt; that the presence of directors of the
                        light railways on the Land Board will strengthen your Board ; and that to
                        carry out the enterprise of the peculiarly local and limited nature of the
                        ,n Egyptian Land Company in the conditions which are necessary to success
                        the best means of securing the local knowledge and unanimity in which are
                        necessary to that end, will, in our opinion, be found in the creation of a
                        single Board, sitting in Cairo, constituted in the manner which I have
                        explained to you. Before putting the resolutions to the meeting I shall be
                        glad to answer any questions you may wish to put to me or to give you any
                        further information in my power.</p>
                    <p>Mr. T. P. Singer asked whether any members of the present London Board would
                        in future serve on the Board in Egypt.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The Chairman ; No.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Singer said that being so, it did not appear to him that there would be
                        any contin­uity from the present Board to the new Board in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman replied that there would not be individually, but the four
                        members who rep­resented the railway on the Cairo Board had always, as
                        members of the Delta Light Rail­ways, been cognisant of all negotiations
                        which had been carried on from time to time by the Land Company. Further
                        answering Mr. Singer, the Chairman said that one of the new mem­bers of the
                        Board would represent the property about to be purchased from the group
                        referred to ; Mr. Williamson had for some time past seen a member of the
                        Delta Land Board, and it would be for the Land Board to appoint the third
                        member. There were obviously practical difficulties in the way of one of the
                        members of the Board being in London, which had been already explained. If
                        they had any they must have more than one. No meetings would be held in
                        London, and the present London mem­bers, after all, spent a very short time
                        in Egypt—two months a year at the outside. A. minority of directors in
                        London would have to accept responsibility for decisions arrived at in their
                        absence, they being unable to exert any effective control over such
                        decisions ; and it would be difficult to find directors who were willing to
                        accept that responsibility. It was better that men on the spot, who were
                        able to inform themselves of all the details, from time to time, should be
                        responsible.</p>
                    <p>THE RESOLUTIONS.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then proposed the first of the special resolutions to which he
                        had already re­ferred, and which, he added, were subject to confirmation at
                        a meeting to be subsequently convened :—</p>
                    <p>That the special resolution of the company passed on the 19th day of July,
                        1906, and confirmed on the 16th day of August, 1906, to the effect following
                        :—</p>
                    <p>That the memorandum and articles of asso­ciation be varied as follows.—1. By
                        strik­ing out from Section 3, sub-section (a) of the memorandum of
                        association the words " in any district," and by substi­tuting for the words
                        " in which the railways belonging to or that may at any time hereafter
                        belong to the Egyptian Delta Light Railways, Ltd., or any ex­tension or
                        branch thereof existing or hereafter constructed, or proposed to be
                        constructed, may serve or be intended to serve " occurring in the same
                        sub­section the words " or in the Sudan " </p>
                    <p>be and is hereby cancelled.</p>
                    <p>Major W. I. Le Breton seconded the res­olution, which was carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman next moved :—</p>
                    <p>That the articles of association as altered by special resolutions passed and
                        confirmed on the 19th July, 1906, and the 16th August, 1906, respectively,
                        be varied as follows : —</p>

                    <p>(b)Art. 81—By inserting next after the words " by the Board for election "
                        the words " or a person to be nominated as hereinafter provided by the

                    <p>(c)Art, 85—By adding next after the words " he is so interested " appearing
                        in line 5 thereof the words- " Provided that this prohibition shall not
                        apply to any contract dealing or transaction with the .Egyptian Delta Light

                    <p>(d)Art. 86—By adding next after the word " vacant " occurring in such article
                        the words " If any director appointed by the Egyptian Delta Light Railways,
                        Ltd„ as a first director, or subsequently under this article shall cease to
                        be a director, otherwise than by retirement by rotation, and on retiring by
                        rotation shall not thereupon be re-elected, the Egyptian Delta Light
                        Railways, Ltd., may by writing delivered within one month of his ceasing to
                        be a director, at a place in Egypt to be appointed by the Board, or at the
                        registered office of this company, nominate a successor, and on such
                        nomin­ation with a consent in writing by the person nominated to act being
                        so deliver­ed, the parson nominated, if qualified, shall become a director,
                        and shall take the place of the director to whom he succeeds."</p>

                    <p>This was seconded by Major-General H.J. Hallowes, and carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman further moved :—</p>
                    <p>That it is desirable that the business and affairs of the company should
                        henceforth be managed and directed entirely from Egypt, and that accordingly
                        the articles of association as altered by special resolutions passed and
                        confirmed on the 19th July, 1906, and the 16th August, 1908, respectively,

                        reasons for which I have already explained. The first is : —</p>
                    <p>That the capital of the company be and is hereby increased from £250,000 to
                        £500,000.</p>

                    <p>Head Office Abbassia, Cairo.</p>
                    <p>PROSPECTUS.</p>
                    <p>The Company has been formed for the objects mentioned in its Memorandum of
                        Association and more especially for the purchase and development and
                        extension of the Abbassia Sand Bricks Company G m.b H.</p>
                    <p>The Abbassia Sand Brick Company G. m; b. H. (hereinafter called the Old
                        Company) was started about two years ago to meet the increasing demand in
                        Cairo and its suburbs for bricks and building materials. A factory was set
                        up by the Old Company and the main work of this factory was the manufacture
                        of sand-bricks.</p>
                    <p>These bricks are made of a mixture of sand and lime (both of which materials
                        are found in abundance in close proximity to the factory) and possess many
                        excellent building qualities. They are more durable and offer a greater
                        power of resistance than the ordinary clay brick and at the same time they
                        can be turned out ready for immediate use in a far shorter space of
                        time.</p>
                    <p>These advantages are naturally appreciated by building and construction firms
                        and companies and large contracts have already been fulfilled for some of
                        the most important of these in Cairo and its suburbs</p>
                    <p>The Semiramis Hotel is built of sand bricks furnished by the Old Company, and
                        a contract has already been entered into for supplying sand-bricks for the
                        new Ritz Hotel that is shortly to be erected at Garden City, Kasr-el-Aine,
                        Cairo. Orders have also been received from the Heliopolis Oasis Company,
                        from the contractor for the new barracks at Abbassia and other important
                        building and contracting firms.</p>
                    <p>In short so many orders have been taken and so many demands have been-made on
                        the Old Company that it has been found impossible to fulfil them all with
                        the present factory.</p>
                    <p>It has been decided therefore to form toe Cairo Sand Bricks Company Limited
                        (hereinafter called the New Company) to take overall assets and liabilities
                        of the Old Company as from the 31st day of December 1906 and with the
                        increased capital that will be provided to considerably enlarge the factory
                        already in existence</p>
                    <p>In this way it is hoped that the output will be more than doubled and that
                        substantial profits will consequently accrue to the New Company.</p>
                    <p>The purchase price to be paid for the business and goodwill of the Old
                        Company has been fixed at Lst, 45.000. This sum will be satisfied by the
                        allotment of fully paid Ordinary and Founders Shares of the New Company as
                        is shown by Agreement No. 1 set out hereunder. For this price the new
                        Company will acquire some &amp;5O0 square metres of land at Abbassia and the
                        plant, machinery, fixtures, etc. of the old Company. Further it will take
                        over the benefit of all contracts entered into by the Old Company in the
                        ordinary course of its business as well as all its liabilities subsequent to
                        the 31st December 1906.</p>
                    <p>The situation of the site of the factory is in the Directors' opinion in
                        every way an excellent one. The necessary material for the manufacture of
                        the bricks is close at hand and in the matter of transport the factory
                        possesses exceptional facilities having at its doors a secondary line of the
                        State Railways and a Branch line of the Delta Light Railways Company.
                        Further lying as it does between Cairo and the Heliopolis Oasis delivery by
                        road to either of these important building centres can be easily
                        effected.</p>
                    <p>The Vendors to and the promoters of the New Company are the Old Company and
                        the following contract has been entered into by them with the New
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>N° 1. AGREEMENT dated the 10th day of April 1907 and made between the Old
                        Company whose registered office is situated at Alexandria of the one part
                        and the New Company of the other part whereby the New Company have the right
                        to acquire from the Old Company as from the 1st day of January 1907 subject
                        to the liabilities of the Old Company subsequent to that date its land and
                        buildings at Abbassia and all its plant stock machinery implement materials
                        and good-will for the sum of Lst. 45,000 to be satisfied by the allotment to
                        the Old Company of 44,250 Ordinary Shares of Lst. 1 each and 15.000 Founders
                        Shares of One Shilling each of the New Company all credited as fully paid.
                        Of this amount no sum is payable for goodwill.</p>
