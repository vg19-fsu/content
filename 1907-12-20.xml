                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>CRIME IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>A recent issve of the London "Daily News" tains a letter from "an ian
                        Correspon t" on the subject of crime in Egypt. That the gentleman who penned
                        the article in question is in no way troubled as to whether his statement
                        contains a moiety of veracity, is sufficiently evident in the following
                        extracts which are ludicrous in their absolute disregard for truth. "Hardly
                        a day passes bat the local Press chronicle some fearful outrage resulting in
                        the death of the victims, perpetrated by armed brigands, banded together for
                        the - pose of vengeance or plunder. But this is all. It not unfrequenly
                        happens that o whole of the inhabitants of neighbouring villages attack one
                        another, when a species of pitched battle takes place, many dead and wonnded
                        being left on the field." The writer ot the above remarkable passage goes on
                        to explain that "the authorities" who are respon sible tor public security
                        are at their wits end to discover an effective preventative" and in
                        conclusion he advocates the formation of a, commission "to overhaul the
                        administration of justice from top to bottom."</p>
                    <p>'Our London contemporary is evidently the possessor of a correspondent who is
                        gifted with the power of i imagination to a marvellous degree, or else one
                        who is extraordinarily easily gulled, for any one who knows anything of the
                        state of Egypt in the present day, also knows that though the occurrence of
                        murder cases are all too frequent, there is no approach to the state of
                        affairsso luminously described in the paragraphs which we have quoted above.
                        Lord Cromer's much quoted paragraph en the Particulars of additional
                        intermeaiate increase of crime is of course paraded as an undeniable witness
                        of the horror of the situa. tion, and, we apologise if we are wrong, this
                        paragraph is introduced with words which strike us with a distinctly
                        familiar ring. Is it beyond the bounds of possibility that they have
                        appeared at no very remote date in the columns of a local contemporary!</p>
                    <p>Whatever the motives which prompted the writer to resort to the
                        extravagancies of which he is guilty, whether he was really actuated by a
                        genuine desire to benefit the country by what he considered to be harmless
                        exaggerations, penned in the hope that they might attract the attention of
                        the home Parliament, or whether, and this weuld seem more probable, he hada
                        certain space to fill, and conscientiously proceed. ed to fill it regardless
                        of truth, the very wildness of his assertion will debar it from receiving
                        serious attention, even by the more advanced sections of the Radical party
                        at home, and itis a pity that the which is responsible for its prodaction Id
                        not have exercised more care in the editing of their correspondent's work.
                        No good turn was ever served by the policy of antruths, and though we do not
                        doubt bat what our contemporary is guiltless of the desire to deceive, it is
                        oéevertheless unfortanate that it should have become the medium of
                        pablication for such a letter as that from which we have quoted.</p>
                    <p>Asa matter of fact, the sitaation in the provinces is at last shewing sings
                        of improve went, which if slight, is considering the manifold diffieulties
                        which lie in the way of suppression of crime which has once got a foothold
                        in such a country as this- The subject has for a long time been receiving
                        the active consideration of both the Ministers of Justice and of the
                        Interior. As we have previously pointed oat, the change from one aystem to
                        another is necessarily one which is franght with unavoidable dangers, and
                        the old system under which the omdeh reigned ina state of practical
                        supremacy being no longer tenable, it was necessary to introducss change,
                        and it is to this fact that the increase of crime was primarily due, the
                        newer laws which demand the swearing of witnesses before conviction being
                        unfortunately regarded in the ixht of leniency, tainted by weakness, by
                        those who came uuder their jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>There is no commission necessary. The Government is alive to the fact that
                        exceptional activity is necessary in the provinces, and all that it is
                        possible to do is being done, with the result that as we have already
                        stated, the more serious offences would already appear to be checked, and we
                        are of the opinion that were a commission formed, the members being of any
                        European country which has had experience of dealing. with countries such as
                        Exypt, that their finding would ee justity the action-of the Government in
                        the matter, without being able to propound one effective suggestion which
                        has vot already been applied.</p>
                    <p>The inauguration of a system empowering the Government to deport criminals
                        would do much to strengthen their power in dealing with this - | question.
                        Many arguments have been brought to bearagainst this innovation, the chief
                        of which appears to be that the same code does not at present hold good in
                        any European country, the people who bring these arguments forward
                        apparently forgetting that the prevailing situations are entirely at
                        variance in the two continents. Deportation was at one time considered
                        necessary in England, among other European countries, and the laws
                        pertaining to it were undoubtedly exercised with beneticial effect in those
                        early days, but such is the sickly sentimentality ofa portion of the present
                        day generation, that the bare suggestion of the revival of such methods is
                        regarded with horror, though it is not more than about sixty years since the
                        same system was applied at home upon those criminals who had proved the
                        ineftectuality of more lenient measures as applied to themselves.</p>
                    <p>The doctrine of the humane treatment of our fellows is noble in its every
                        degree, bat the morbid extension 'of sympathy to the criminal classes at the
                        expense of the law-abiding population is poisonous in its effect upon a
                        nation Deported criminals are subjected to treatment every whit as humane as
                        they would receive were they located in the local jail, and why it should be
                        considered necessary to confine them to local imprisonment at the expense of
                        the country, when by deporting them for a period, they would be given every
                        opportunity of training themselves to become useful members of society, isa
                        question that can: never receive a satisfactory reply.</p>

                    <p>CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM LEAGUE.</p>
                    <p>As announced a short time ago in these columns the moderate nationalists have
                        been busy organising themselves into a party under the chairmanship:of
                        Sheikh Ali Bey Yussef. Convenient premises have been taken on the first
                        floor of a house nearly opposite the Turf Club, and in about a week's time
                        all will be ready for holding the inaugural meeting of the general
                        committee. Some days ago the Arabic version of the statutes of the league
                        setting forth its aim' and constitution was published, an Englirh haa of
                        which has just reached va. The following is an extract :-—</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLES OF THE LEAGUE.</p>
                    <p>(a) Maintendnce of the Khedivial authority as guaranted by the Firmans
                        conferring upon Egypt Administrative Independence.</p>
                    <p>(b) Reliance upon the pledges given and declarations made by Great Britain at
                        the time of the Occupation and claiming their fulfilment.</p>
                    <p>(c) A demand for representative institutions invested with full political and
                        administrative powers in so far as Egyptians and Egyptian interests are
                        alone concerned.</p>
                    <p>(d) Primary Education to be general and gratuitous.</p>
                    <p>(e) Arabic to be the medium of instruction in all Egyptian Government
                        Schools.</p>
                    <p>(f) Posts in the Egyptian Government to be given to natives according to
                        their capacity and merit with the object of diminishing as far as possible
                        the number of foreigners in the service of the Government and thus enabling
                        the Egyptians to learn to govern themselves.</p>
                    <p>(g) Extension of the Jurisdiction of the Mixed Courts, which already try
                        civil, commercial and petty offences, to criminal cases in which foreigners
                        -are concerned until such period as it may be possible to inaugurate unity
                        of Jurisdiction and thus affirm the great principle of justice for all who
                        inbabit the same country, namely, "Equality before the Law."</p>
                    <p>The leagve's chief office is in Cairo bat it is contemplated establishing
                        branches in all the principal towns of Egypt. An administrative council
                        consisting of fifteen members selected from a general committee unlimited in
                        numbers, and which has already been extensively joined, will carry out the
                        arrangements of the league. Members of the committee will pay an entrance
                        fee of L.E. 2 and an annual sub- | scription of LE. 5, whilst ordinary
                        members will be admitted on payment of P.T. 20 and an an annual subscription
                        of P.T. 560. One of the rules contains a very salutary provision, namely,
                        that religious topics shall be excluded from discussion save 80 far as the
                        management of religions institations is concerned. The meaning of this is
                        that whilst the league shal! he free to criticise the administration of
                        ecclesiastical endowments such as the Wakfs and Al-Azhar "with a view to
                        introducing feforms of, general utility" it shall not lay itself open to the
                        charge of promoting Pau Islamic propaganda. For the rest, the aims of the
                        league do not present any feature sicenien develty or disconcerting
                        tendencies.</p>
                    <p>All the claims put forward have been already foreshadowed in the speeches and
                        manifestoes of Sheikh Ali Yaissef and Hafiz Effendi Awad.</p>
                    <p>Political groupingsin Egypt resolve themselves into three sections, the first
                        of which demands the evacuation of the English from the Nile Valley
                        unconditionally, the second, so soon as the Egyptians shal] become capable
                        of governing themselves and have given proof that by the departure of the
                        English political and commercial interests shall not be injured ; and the
                        third desire to remain for ever under British tutelage. Needless to add that
                        the second section is represented by the league Its demands, however remote
                        some of them may he from realisation, are certainly concluded in language of
                        scrupulous moderation, and are not calculated to wound the susceptibilities
                        of the most staunch Imperialist. It is to the credit of the founder of this
                        movement and his coadjutors that they should have framed a body of rules
                        which are on the whole clear and com prehensive. Their programme, too, has
                        been well reeeived by the Arabic Press and the public whith had beeome
                        confused by a ple thora of political programmes and nausented by the
                        fanfaronade and _ rhetorical falsetto of Mustapha Pasha Kamel. Little to the
                        liking of this frothy phrase-monger must be the evergy displayed by his
                        nationalist competitors in completing sach an organisation which has already
                        been formed by some of the most aceompilshed writers in the Arabic Republic
                        ot Letters. He feels evidently that some counter effort must be made and he
                        theretore proposes to pronounce one of his illuminating dixcourses on the
                        27th inst. before a meeting of the so called nationalist party, when he will
                        discuss the object of his party about which he has for long years taken good
                        care that the public shall be in no doubt. We may therefore expect nothing
                        but a rechauf/# of his "Anglais et Egyptiens" seasoned with choice morsels
                        from the Zizinia oration, But there is to be something more. No utterance of
                        his would be complete without an out-pouring of the vials of his wrath upon
                        those who dare to differ from bim. So we are to be regaled with an account
                        of the machinations employed by his enemies in attacking him. Who ever said
                        that he recognises only two classes of men—tools and enemies—was probably
                        not far from the mark. And as a final bonne bouche he will demonstrate in an
                        eloquent peroration— Kamel is nothing if not eloquent—of the tub-thumping
                        order, that his party consisting of his brother# his sisters his cousins and
                        his aunts is the only—the very only—one which cen Egypt, where too there is
                        a political awakening, ag well as in India. In Europe, the formation of a
                        political organisation is such sn everyday affair that it attracts but
                        little or no attention. Here, however, being an entirely new experiment, it
                        is regarded in native circles as an event of considerable importance. For
                        ourselves we can Only say that we shall watch its development with interest
                        unmixed with anxiety.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir,-The recent decision of the
                            British Consular Court, declaring that the actions of the Directors of
                            Bourse and Banking Co. of Egypt Ltd., in refusing to issue any
                            certificates or share warrants to bearer of the Company, was illegal,
                            will probably lead to still further interesting developments in
                            connection with the investigation of the affairs of this Company, which
                            had so short and so disappointing a</p>
                        <p>career.</p>
                        <p>It has been argued that because the contracts rendered to their clients
                            by the brokers contained the clause that all operations were subject to
                            the rules and regulations of the Alexandria Bourse, that the clients
                            must there- fore submit to any conditions, which the committee may in
                            their wisdom see fit to impose; but however powerful a body the As-
                            Bociation de Courtiers en Valeurs may be, they are still amenable to the
                            law, the same as other people, and the decision of the committee in the
                            case of the Bourse and Banking Company of Egypt Ld. to make a new
                            regulation retroactive, would undoubtedly meet with short shrift, should
                            any of the unfortunate share holders, who had sold their shares at a
                            premium, decide upon taking legal action to compel their brokers to
                            accept and pay for the shares at the price at which the sale was ef
                            fected.</p>
                        <p>Such a course would probably entail unplea sant consequences to many
                            equally unfortunate brokers and would lead to still further
                            complications, as those of them who subscribed, at the time to what may
                            be called the Arditi Brothers Relief Fund, would naturally demand
                            repayment of the amounts contributed by them to carry the Bourse and
                            Banking salvage scheme through; and as the subscrib ers to the fund in
                            question received in exchange for their cash, certain promissory notes
                            of the Arditi Brothers, payable at various dates it would be interesting
                            to find out by means of a legal action, what parties could be made
                            liable to refund the amounts subscribed by the principal brokers
                            interested in the fa mous so-called "settlement" of the dealings in the

                        <p>L'argument principal consiste en la signature par le client de la note où
                            il est dit que "les contractants ont pleine connaissance etc." Il ne
                            faut pas être grand clere pour répondre qu'on a signé en connaissance de

                        <p>Quant à l'art. 15, sur lequel s'appuie "le dé- sintéressé" il ne peut
                            avoir de valeur juridique en la matière; car on ne peut léser d'une ma

                            faites sur tel titre sous prétexte que le règlement de ces transactions
                            serait nuisible à tel ou à tel courtier.</p>

                            of the Company, which is to be held on Saturday next. If they muster in
                            force they can prevent the resolutions being carried and the Board of
                            Directors getting their own way. It, on the contrary, through the
                            slackness of the share- holders the resolutions are carried, then they
                            bave only themselves to blame. The action of the shareholders at next
                            Saturday's meeting will be watched by many persons, who have no interest
                            in the company, for it will show decisively whether shareholders of
                            Egyptian companies can look after their own interesta and prevent
                            directors from doing just as they please, or whether, as is said to be

                            Under the circumstances am I justified in refusing to throw good money
                            after bad and to refrain from paying the call. Perhaps one of your

                    <p>The report of the directors of the Oceana Consolidated Company, Limited,
                        presented at the annual general meeting of shareholders held on the 12th
                        inst., contains the following remarks on the New Egyptian Company:-</p>
                    <p>A dividend of 10 per cent, has been received this year on our investment, the
                        New Egyptian Company having been able to make profitable sales of some of
                        its extensive holdings, both in agricultural land and town sites. The Nile
                        reclamation works carried out by the Company, under the direction of Mr.
                        Beresford, continue to make good progress. Increasing returns are being
                        shown from the steamers and floating plant in the Sudan. General depression
                        following over-speculation set in during the spring, and has been succeeded
                        by a monetary crisis. This has for the present affected the market quotation
                        of New Egyptian shares, which is considerably below the intrinsic value of
                        that Company's assets.</p>

                        that H.H. the Khedive takes in the Army of Occupation, it may interest your
                        readers, to know that he has been pleased to present the prizes for the

                    <p>We understand, says the "Sudan Times," that the appropriation for street
                        improvement will be considerably cut down. This is much to be regretted, as
                        the streets are in a condition that calls for an increase of the appro-
                        priation for their improvement.</p>
                    <p>The work projected for the immediate future includes the metalling of the
                        streets connecting Sirdar Avenue with Khedive Avenue. The metalling of both
                        avenues will be completed from end to end, so that when this is done, all
                        the northern section of the town will have its streets in an excellent
                        condition. We have not learned, however, whether the funds in hand or in
                        sight are sufficient for this purpose.</p>

                    <p>MR. WALLIS'S TEAM v. SUEZ ET.C. On Thursday afternoon last the above match
                        was played at Suez before a large and enthusiastic crowd The teams were as
                        follows. Suez E.T.C. Goal, Owen, backs, Williams and Young, half-backs,
                        Grace, Hubble and Smyth, forwards, Eden, Isgar, Merchant, Butler and
                        Pitluck.</p>
                    <p>Port Said, goal, Wallis, backs, Williams and Brooks, half-backs, Broatch,
                        Ingram and Rush, forwards King, Tweedie, Field, Beery and</p>
                    <p>Howe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wallis won the toss and selected the north end of the field. Suez pressed
                        at the start and after a little spirited work Merchant, their centre forward
                        drew first blood. Suez continued to press and for some time Port Said were
                        obliged to play a defensive game, Suez forwards were playing in grand com-
                        bination and pressed hard. Mr. Wallis saved well time after time, and well
                        deserved the applause he received. Isgar was the next scorer for Suez, his
                        shot was a marvellous one at a very difficult angle. From a corner, play
                        bung round the visitors line for some time, but Port Said managed to clear,
                        and play ranged up and down the field. Through effective passing by Eden,
                        Isgar, Butler and Merchant, Suez were able to add their third goal. In a
                        brief attack by Port Said, the home backs had a little work to do but were
                        only once dangerously pressed, and then the defence proved equal to the
                        occasion.</p>
                    <p>In the second half Port Said showed better</p>
                    <p>from but found the defence too strong and the ground too fast. Suez often
                        pressed but could not add to their score and when time was called the score
                        stood Suez E.T.C. 3.-Mr. Wallis' team 0.</p>

                    <head>WEDDING OF >MR. GUY CHRISTOPHER FOSTER AND MISS MARY LOUISE AIDA
                        BORCHGREVINK.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Guy Foster, second son of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Percival Foster of
                        Alexandria, was married yesterday afternoon to Miss Aida Borchgrevink, only
                        daughter of the Procureur General of the Mized Tribunals, and Mrs.
                        Borobgrevink, of Cliff House, Bulkeley, Ramleh. The Ven. Archdeaon Ward,
                        assisted by the Rev. Norman Lee, Chaplain to the Forces of the Alexandria
                        Garrison, officiated, at St. Mark's Church, Alexandria. The youthful bride,
                        who looked charming, was given away by her father. She wore a lovely dress
                        of white Liberty satin; the folds of the fichu draped bodice were trimmed
                        with the finest Point de Bruxelle, which lace re-appeared in flower on the
                        round Court train. The bridal veil of the rarest Honiton lace was lent by
                        the bridegroom's mother, having been worn by herself when a bride, and the
                        shower bouquet was made by Mrs. Preston. It was composed of lilies of the
                        valley, white camelias, azaleas and roses, with myrtle and asparagus fern
                        sprays tied with white satin ribbons. Her only ornament, was a beautiful
                        pendant in the form of a heart encrusted with diamonds, the gift of the
                        bridegroom's parents. Five bridesmaids were in attendance, three of whom
                        were children. They were Miss Carola Tuck, Miss Ethné Chataway, Miss Agnes
                        Carver, Miss Pauline Satow, and Miss Marian Percival. The bridesmaids were
                        all in Empire dresses of Eau de Nil Liberty satin with face yokes ornamented
                        by two handsome paste circular brooches at each side. They wore green
                        Morocco shoes and mistletoe and holly wreaths, the white and red berries
                        amongst the dark leaves giving a seasonable note to a ceremony which had
                        come into such near proximity to Christmas-tide.</p>
                    <p>The bridegroom's presents to the two grown up bridesmaids were pendants set
                        with rubies and diamonds, whilst the three little girls were given pendants
                        set with peridots. Each bridesmaid also received a bouquet to match their
                        wreaths, carrying out the old Christmas tradition of our Northern climes.
                        Mr. Hugh Foster was his brother's best man and had only arrived three days
                        previously from Cambridge to take up his duties at the ceremony. The wedding
                        service was fully choral and opened with the beautiful hymn "Thine for Ever,
                        God of love," by Archbishop Maclagan. The other hymns given were "Lead us
                        Heavenly Father" and at the conclusion of the service Bach's hymn "May the
                        Grace of Christ our Saviour," sung kneeling.</p>
                    <p>The clergy met the bride at the West end and formed a procession up the
                        aisle. The church which is well adapted to a wedding ceremony was carpeted
                        with Persian rugs from the porch to the altar and the choir was tastefully
                        decorated by Mrs. Ward and some of her friends with white roses, deturas and
                        greenery, whilst the West end was formed into a complete palm grove. The
                        choir did their part excellently well and were seated on the Decani side
                        whilst the parents, and Consuls of Great Britain and Norway were seated
                        opposite. As the bridal procession returned from the vestry the three child
                        bridesmaids assisted by three little girls, clad in white, scattered
                        rose-leaves in front of the nearly married pair. The organist, Mr. Heaton,
                        played as the Voluntary, the Triumphal March by the famous Norwegian
                        composer Grieg and concluded the service with Mendelssohn's Wedding March
                        from the Midsummers Night Dream. After the wedding everyone repaired to
                        Cliff House, Ramleh, where Mrs. Borchgrevink held a reception. The weather
                        although boisterous was fortunately otherwise fair and the invited guests,
                        several hundreds of whom availed themselves of their host and hostess' kind
                        invitation, were enabled to get dryfooted to their destination.</p>
                    <p>The splendid band of the Royal Inniskilling Fosiliers was in attendance and a
                        most enjoyable afternoon was spent, the spacious tents erected in front of
                        the house giving ample room for the large assembly of friends of all
                        nationalities. At 5.30 the newly wedded couple took leave of their relations
                        and friends. Mrs. Guy Foster was in a very neat tailor made gown of a pretty
                        maize and grey striped material with pleated skirt and a three quarter
                        length cut-a-way coat with dark satin revers bordered with white silk galon.
                        A maize straw hat with plume of white feathers completed a charming and
                        suitable travelling costume.</p>
                    <p>The happy couple had to pass through arches of muslin scarves held over their
                        heads, as they went down the long flight of steps, by young friends of both
                        sexes. We hear it is a Norwegian custom and added a Scandinavian touch to
                        the proceedings. Amidst a shower of rice they sought safety in a motor which
                        glided away down the steep hill and on to Sidi Gaber to catch the 6. 5.
                        train. The honeymoon will be spent at Assouan.</p>

                            <p>The Pope personally conducted this morning the ceremony of the Pablic
                                Consistory, attended by thousands of invited persons, especially
                                foreigners, including many English speaking people.</p>
                            <p>Those extraneous to the ceremony gathered in special places, while
                                the Cardinals, Prelates, and "Court" personages assembled to await
                                the Pontiff in another hall. Meanwhile the Cardinals created on
                                Monday, and Cardinals Rinaldini and Ageirre y Garcia, created in the
                                last Consistory, repaired to the Sistine Chapel, where they took
                                their oath of office before the chiefs of the three orders of
                                Cardinals. </p>
                            <p>In the procession first came the Swiss Guards followed by the
                                personages of the ecclesiastical and lay courts. </p>
                            <p>His Holiness, in complete pontifical robes, was walking on foot
                                blessing as he went. Following him came another long train of
                                personages, together with the Sistine Choir. </p>
                            <p>The Pope mounted the throne amid a respectful silence The new
                                Cardinals were then introduced and while kneeling one by one at the
                                Pontiff's feet he repeated the formula "accipe galeram rubrum."
                                Then, separately, after the papal embrace, went to each of the
                                Cardinals and received a fraternal salute, the choir meanwhile
                                singing. After the ceremony was over Pius X. rose, and gave the
                                apostolic blessing and slowly withdrew, the procession reforming as
                                an escort.</p>
                            <p>Later, Pius X. held a short supplementary Secret Consistory. (

                        (Mr. W.F. Garland) having read the notice convening the meeting and the
                        auditors' report.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : Gentlemen, you have no doubt all carefuily stadied the
                        directors' report, as well as the balance-sheet to June 80th last, recently
                        issued. Mr. Robert Taylor will, as usual, describe to you the mining details
                        in regard to our last year's work. Turning to the balance-sheet, at June
                        30th, being the date to which the accounts are made up, there had been
                        called up upon the 155,000 cash shares 15s per share, leaving a liability of
                        bs per shate The comparatively large amount outstanding on calls, viz,
                        £%,626 188, was due to the fagt that a call became payable on June Ist, and
                        that some of the amounts has not been received at the time the accounts were
                        made up. They" were, however, paid shortly after. The expenditure for the
                        twelve months under the heading of "Mining and general expenditure,"
                        amounted to £21675 Is 7d. We deduct £42 lls 3d received as transfer fees,
                        interest, etc., leaving £21,832 10s 4d. This includes £1,617 1s 5d written
                        off for deprecia- tion of buildings, machinery, plant, and rolling stock,
                        which is less than the amount written off for the previous year, when the
                        account was dealt with in a somewhat more drastic manner than will again
                        become necessary. The expenditure on capital account for the twelve months
                        was £6,322 12s 4d. The items are fully set out in detail in the repert.
                        Since June 80th, at which date we had a balance of working capital of
                        £42,531 1s 6d,a further 2s 2d per share has been called up, the last call
                        being payable on November 4th At the present moment our balance of working
                        capital is about £22,000.</p>
                    <p>We think you will have come to the con- clusion, after reading the directors'
                        report, that we have no reason to be other than satisfied with the
                        considerable progress which has been made at the mine during the past year,
                        and with the favourable features which the under- fature. Indeed, I look
                        upon the history Water supply at Nabardi as one of the most i teresting
                        episodesin the history of the mine. When Mr. Liewelyn first visited Nabardi
                        in 1901 there was practically no water there at all. After some months' work
                        witha view to proving the presence of gold, and having acquired the
                        practical certainty of the mine being likely to turn out productive, the
                        water question be- came one of vital importance, and a boring plant was
                        despatched, and some consi- derable time was spent in searching before a
                        supply was found sufficient to provide for the needs of a camp such as would
                        be necessary to develop the mine. Since that time the sapply of water at
                        Nabardi and in its immediate neighbourhood has steadily increased, and our
                        chief service of supply is now likely to be the Maftah well, which is about
                        16 miles from the mine. That well was originally commenced with the idea
                        that, being in sandstone forma- tion, the chances of finding water were
                        excep- tionally good, for the sandstone is traceable for some ten miles in
                        length until it reaches a range of bills, and it is some two miles in width,
                        and such a formation might naturally be expected to form a sort of catchment
                        area for the drainage of the hills. The depth of the sandstone has not yet
                        been ascertained. The well is at present 190 ft. deep, and is indicating @
                        probable increased supply as we 'go | deeper, it may be mentioned that,
                        whilst at 182 ft it gave 600 gallons per 24 hours, on being continued
                        another 8 ft the quantity increased to 7,000 gallons. It is, therefore, not
                        unreasonable to assume that from this source we shall get a satisfactory and
                        continuous supply.</p>
                    <p>Reviewing the whole position, the directors recently came to the conelusion
                        that, as the mine has now reached a stage of development warranting the
                        erection of a mill, there is no longer any reason why the mill should not be
                        installed at the mine itself Until the ore reserves can be more increased
                        the direetors have thought it advisable to erect a 10-stamp mill only, to be
                        added to as cireum- stances render it necessary and expedient. About the
                        time this decision was come to your directors were informed that an
                        opportunity was presenting itself to acquire a mill ata mine in Egypt which
                        las now discontinued operations. Your directors caused this mill to be
                        inspected, and, it having been found to be in good condition, it has since
                        been purchased, and is now on its way to the property. I may say that owing
                        to the distance of the Muftah well from the mine, and the consequent neces-
                        sity for a long pipe-line to carry the water, the cost of erecting the mill
                        at Nabardi and getting all ready for a start will be much the same as it we
                        had erected it on the Nile, but there will be a considerable saving in
                        running it, as the ore will not now have to be carried 180 miles for
                        treatment. Moreover, there will be not only economy, but also many other
                        advantages in treating the ore on the spot, instead of having to keep op a
                        separate establishment on the Nile for that parpose. Before finally
                        determin. ing what treatment beyond amalgamation will be required to extract
                        the highest possible per- centage of the gold contents of the ore, the
                        directors are awaiting the complete result of some tests being carried out
                        by a London firm ona bulk sample from the deeper develop- ments at the mine.
                        So far as the tests have gone, thére would appear to be every probabi- lity
                        that the extraction will be satisfactory. For milling, it is proposed to
                        utilise the water from the Muftah well, and the necessary pipe- line to
                        convey it to the mill site is in course of shipment. It is not certajp as to
                        how soon the mill may be in operation, but we are quite hoping that we shall
                        be able to make a start in May at the latest. Throughout the past year the
                        native labour supply has been ample, and we are glad to say that the health
                        of the camp has continued good.</p>
                    <p>You will notice that our superintendent, Mr. Holman, retains a very
                        favourable opinion of our prospects, and considers that we ate working upon
                        a true fissure vein, upon which we should vpen up a valuable mine. Although
                        outside of the Om Nabardi mining lease we are at present doing no work, yet,
                        in view of the possibilities in connection with the conces- sion, we have
                        felt desirous of keeping our hold upon the 22,000 square miles originally
                        granted</p>

                        <p>The above two well-known old rivals met at</p>
                        <p>Ras-el-Tin in the above competition. Both</p>
                        <p>teams were at full strength and considering the</p>
                        <p>ground was in the pink of condition, a good</p>
                        <p>game was in store for those who lined the ropes.</p>
                        <p>At exactly 8.30 p.m. the referee lined his men</p>
                        <p>out. The stripes won the toss and MoArthor</p>
                        <p>800 spectators. Play was very fast at the start</p>
                        <p>and the stripes defence was severely pressed.</p>
                        <p>Walsh and Tripp narrowly missed scoring.</p>
                        <p>Midfield play now followed until McArthur</p>
                        <p>burst away and following a rush on the stripes</p>

                        <p>McArthur doing the needful. On tesuming,</p>
                        <p>play took a turn towards Boyd and Company.</p>
                        <p>The latter were however in splendid form,</p>
                        <p>especially Skelly, time and again the latter</p>
                        <p>saved the position when all seemed lost, the</p>
                        <p>greens now tvok play in hand and succeeded</p>
                        <p>in getting a corner which proved fruitless.</p>
                        <p>McArthor spoiled a good chance by lying off</p>
                        <p>side. Play was very even, both teams doing their</p>
                        <p>utmost.</p>
                        <p>Skelly was very conspicuous in the greens</p>
                        <p>defence while Reynolds for the stripes display-</p>
                        <p>ed wonderful form. The stripes now took play towards Boyd and Company,
                            the former being cheered for a praiseworthy save; play raged fast and
                            furious from this to the interval, the score then reading.</p>
