                        tell the truth — slightly amused by the opening of Mr. Robertson's speech.
                        We quite understand that he is grateful to our confrère Hafiz Effendi Awad
                        for his assistance and aid : we are the first to admit that our Confrères
                        social, linguistic, and journalistic abilities have made him an ideal
                        exponent of the views of the party which he represents, and wo are convinced
                        that purely patriotic motives could alone have persuaded our retiring
                        confrère to assume for the nonce the ardurous career of impresario ; but we
                        feel a certain tendency to smile when we learn that Mr. Robertson has to all
                        appearances described the Editor of "Al Minbar" as his political Mentor. An
                        Egyptian visitor to England who took, say, the Editor of the "Daily Mail''
                        for his "guide, philosopher, and friend," or, going to the other extreme,
                        sought counsel and information from the Editor of "Reynolds' Newspaper,"
                        would in either case return to Alexandria or Port Said with a somewhat
                        lop-sided view of British social and political conditions, and in the case
                        of Mr. Robertson we me entitled to ask whether that gentleman is about to
                        supply Parliament with a stream of facts exclusively supplied by the Editor
                        of "Al Minbar." In saying this we do not wish to cast the slightest
                        aspersion on the good faith of our confrère, but to insist on the somewhat
                        obvious truth that the version of facts— notably in political
                        questions—given by any individual must Ire largely dependent on the personal
                        equation. However, Mr. Robertson will doubtless soon enlighten us on this
                        question, and we look forward with interest to the results of his Egyptian
                        tour.</p>

                    <head>THE PROBLEM OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The most important article in the last "Edin-burgh Review" is a careful study
                        of the new problem which faces Lord Cromer in Egypt. Formerly the task of
                        the British Administra-tion was to give peace and prosperity to the land Now
                        this has been accomplished, and the result has been the growth of Egyptian
                        nation-alism. The material progress of the people, however, having outrun
                        their moral and intellectual growth, we find that their aspira-tions
                        naturally do not correspond to their political capacity. The true policy is
                        to recognize what merit there may be in the new feeling, and to give this
                        national spirit all the scope which is consistent with the preservation of
                        the advantages which the British Administration has conferred. The writer
                        shows how the representative principle is even now admitted in Egyptian
                        administration, and how no' Englishman is appointed to a post which can be
                        competently filled by an Egyptian. This principle may be extended, and while
                        ordinary constitutional government would be out of the question, it might be
                        possible to do much in the way of developing self-government in the
                        municipalities. The three dangerous forces— nationalism, the Anglophobe Arab
                        Press, and Pan-Islamism—may be counteracted by an. intelligent liberalism in
                        the Administration, and by the growth of progressive ideas among the
                        Mohamedans themselves.</p>

                    <head>THE KHEDIVE</head>
                    <p>The celebration of the anniversary of the Khedive's accession is thus
                        commented on by Mr. Edward Diecey in the "Daily Telegraph":— On Tuesday his
                        Highness the Khedive celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of his accession
                        to the Viceregal throne. If "Whitaker's Almanack" is correct, and any doubt
                        as to its infallibility is to my mind a pestilent heresy, Abbas Pasha Hilmi
                        is now a man of thirty- three, that is, in the very prime of life. Judged by
                        ordinary Oriental standards, he has been an intelligent, active, and popular
                        ruler. From the outset, however, of his reign the Khedive has had little or
                        no chances of showing his ability as an administrator, and in consequence
                        his special qualifications for the exorcise of Sovereign power must be taken
                        mainly upon credit. Year after year, under our virtual protectorate, his
                        Highness's authority as the nominal Sovereign of Egypt has been diminished
                        rather by general causes than by any deliberate design. His personal
                        relations with our British authorities have gradually become, if not less
                        cordial, certainly less intimate. He lives mainly at his Palace of Koubbeb,
                        some half-dozen miles away from Cairo, on the out- skirts of the Suez
                        Desert. He hardly ever posses a night in his huge barrack-like Palace of
                        Abdeen, the last, I think, of the numerous palaces built by his grandfather
                        in or near the capital which now remains intact. In the old pre-occupation
                        era the Khedives were in fact, as well as in name, the fountains of honour,
                        the distributors of rewards and punishments, and their residences were
                        crowded daily by petitioners, suppliants, and persons with grievances, who,
                        according to immemorial usages, had full and free right of access to their
                        presence. All this is changed to-day, and the visitors to Koubbeh are
                        comparatively few in number. I fancy, however, that during the year just
                        ended a variety of circumstances, familiar to all persons acquainted with
                        modern Egypt, have led to an impression that, under certain not altogether
                        improbable contingencies, his Highness may play hereafter a somewhat more
                        active part in the administration of Egypt than he has played of late, and
                        this impression has led all those who are dissatisfied with the present
                        political conditions of the country to look upon Abbas II. as the possible
                        figurehead of a so far leaderless movement. Neither I, nor anyone, can say
                        with certainty whether his Highness views the vague and impracticable ideas
                        of the Egyptian Nationalists with favour or disfavour, but, in any case, tho
                        favour must necessarily be of a very platonic kind.</p>

                            <p>The annual carnival often furnishes an excuse to a certain class of
                                the population to indulge in practices which can only be described
                                as reprehensible. One of these practices is the indiscriminate
                                throwing from the windows of houses or in the streets of missiles of
                                all kinds, likely in many cases to injure the passers-by. The
                                Alexandria Gouvernorat authorities make a pressing appeal to the
                                public, on the approach of these fetes, to cases the practice, which
                                degenerates into a scandolous abuse. We are informed that if the
                                abuse is persisted in the Gouvernorat will find it necessary to
                                prosecute offender, in conformity with Articles 343 of the Native
                                Penal Code and 334 of the Mixed Penal Code. AS regards persons who
                                make use of the windows or balconies of houses to throw hard
                                missiles at passers-by, the Gouvernorat, when it fails to identify
                                the offenders themselves, will hold the tenants of the houses who

                            for the improvement of the harbour of Alexandria is the small harbour
                            for barges. It will be built close to the great lighthouse, and will be
                            large enough to accomodate 200 barges. The construction of theis harbour
                            will be commenced in few days time. A credit L.E. 9,000 has been
                            allotted for the work.</p>

                                to cope with the business. Another important work executed last year
                                was the embankment of 8,000 square metre to the West of Aresnal,
                                behind the floating dock, for the purpose of removing the Khedivial

                            <p>The works, whic are new in progress, are not to be considered in any
                                degree final. New projects for improving Alexandria's ports are to
                                be submitted to the Egyptian Governement in the course of this year,
                                it is hoped that these will be begun in 1908. the fears that were
                                expressed two yrars ago as to the possibility of Port Said ruining
                                and eventually displacing Alexandria as the best Port of Egypt are
                                quite groundless. From 1900 to 1906 Port Said trade increased by 47%
                                while that of Alexandria increased by 51%. The value of the imports
                                at Alexandria in 1905 was L.E. 19066338, against Port Said's L.E.
                                1011400. Last year the figures were respectively, L.E. 21520353 and
                                L.E. 1410354. While the value of Alexandria's Port showed and
                                increase of L.E. 2454015 over the previous year's figures Port Said
                                only increased during the same time by L.E. 1,125,881. Port Said's
                                exports of merchandise last year amounted to L.E. 82,644, an
                                increase of L.E. 134181 of 1905. Alexandria's merchandise imports of
                                1905 were L.E. 23977211, and increase of L.E of 4846186. The weight
                                of goods imported at ALexandria in 1900 was 1544000 tons, and in
                                1905 2,500,000 tons. The exports in 1900 weighed 850,000 tons. The
                                total increase was from 2394000 tons to 3450000 tons. Alexandria in
                                1905 discharged 575 tons of goods per lineal metre of quay, against
                                Liverpool's 274 tons, Hamburgs 368 tons, Mersailles 380 tons, and
                                Triestes 281 tons per lineal metre of quay. These figures speak
                                volumes for the amount of work got through the Egyptian port. The
                                total tonnage of boats out and home at Alexandria in 1900 was
                                4700000 and 1906 8800000. In eight years from 1900 Alexandria will
                                have double its import traffic, while Rotterdam, which is a good
                                sample of a progressive European port, has only succeeded in
                                doubling her imports in 11 years. After Mersailles' and Genoa along
                                the ports of the Mediterranean ALexandria comes in the second group,
                                which includes Naples and Algeria, and there is not the slightest
                                need to feat that Port Said will be able to der her any harm as a
                                port. </p>

                    </div>
                    <div type="item">
                        <p>A review of the trade of Egypt during the past few years has become a
                            monotonous reiteration of continued success. Nothing occurs to check its
                            steady expansion, and it would be difficult to imagine a calamity of
                            sufficient importance to disturb its solid foundation. The Nile flood
                            may be lower in one year than another, or it may exceed the average; but
                            in either case, the damage done is not really very serious and anyhow
                            the annual flood can be always depended on to provide sufficient
                            irrigation for most of the cultivated land. We have niether drought now
                            tempest to injure the crops, and they are never exposed to the risks of
                            strong winds, heavy rains, or frosts. There is always a hot son and
                            water enough to keep the roots moist. Locusts, caterpillats, or worms,
                            when they appear, are promptly dealt with by the Government before they
                            can do much damage. Famine is practically unknown and the reputed
                            existence of plague is usually confined to isolated cases, in regard to
                            which the more enlightened inhabitants of the country are extremely
                            sceptical.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>The NATURE AND VLAUE OF IMPORTS.</head>
                        <p>The value of goods imported into Egypt during the ten months ended
                            October 31, amounted to considerably over 19.5 millions sterling,
                            represetning and increase of over 2,000,000 pounds, in comparison with
                            the same period of 1903. Great Britain's share of these imports had
                            increased ot the extent of 630,000 pounds, and there is no doubt that
                            the result would have been still more gratifying if manufactureers of
                            cotton piece goodshad been able to deliver orders in reasonable time.
                            These figures alone are sufficient indicationof the continuous rapid
                            growth of prosperity in the country, and it is interesting to note in
                            the Customs returns the ever increasing demand for most manufactured
                            articles which are usually required only by contries in an advanced
                            state of civilization. Lord Cromer has explained in sever of his annual
                            reports that Egypt stands in the unique position of as Oriental country
                            which has assimilated a very cosiderable portion of European
                            civilization.</p>
                        <p>The rapid rise of land values in recent years was quickly followed by
                            grearly increased prices paid for the cotton crop, and both these
                            movements produced an accumulation of much wealth to landed proprietors,
                            cultivators, and most other classes. A demand for better housing
                            accomodation soon began, and this led to a desire for modern comforts,
                            which is expanding rapidly, owing to various causes ehich include the
                            annual migration to Europe for the summer months, the civilising
                            influence of travle in other countries, the greater freedom given to rhe
                            Mohamedan ladies, the sprawl of education, and the attractions to
                            village notables of residence in Cairo or other cities. Building sires
                            changed hands with bewildering rapidity and realized twice their
                            original values in a few months. Old dwellings were demolished in every
                            direction and replaced by large blcoks of flats fitted with modern
                            sanitary appliances, electric bells, and facilities for gas or electric
                            lighting. Numerous joint stock companies were to deal with one form of
                            development or another. Egyptians were no longer afrais to display their
                            wealth, and took rather a natural delight in outshining one another in
                            the spledour of their foreign horses, carriages, or other novel
                            possessions.</p>
                        <p>Modern Egypt, therefore, may be said to have moer advanced notions of
                            cvilisation than most of Eastre Europe, and her requirements will be
                            drawn more and more from the country best fitted to supply them
                            intelligently.</p>

                        <head>FINANCING THE COTTON CROP</head>
                        <p>The customary financial arrangements to deal with the cotton crop were
                            quite inadequate this season, and all calculations based on past
                            experience were upset owing to the unexpected fervour with which the
                            fallasheen rushed into the market to avail themselves of the remarkable
                            high prices ruling at the beginning of the season. A scarcity of gold in
                            Alexandria resulting from the operation of liftng the crop is predicted
                            every year, but rarely provided for ; this season the situation was
                            strained to an acute degree early in November, and the banks were forced
                            to make hasty demands for further supplies. But the crop was found to be
                            larger than usual, and the prices were steadily mainstained ;
                            consequently sales were made to an abnormal extent, and the gold
                            reserves were once more exhausted early in December. The banks
                            complained that the gold ad not been filtering back from the provinces
                            with its usual regularity ; but the main cause of the trouble would
                            appear to be the inability of their head offices in London to realize
                            the situation, and possibly their unwillingness to follow the measures
                            recommended by the man on the spot.</p>
                        <p>The English advisers to the Government have shown some anxiety recently
                            to introduce preventative measures in regard to speculation in cotton,
                            but their intentions were opposed unanimously by the cotton merchants.
                            Sspeculation is an essential feature of the trade, and it is the primary
                            cause of the marvellous increase in the value of the Egyptian cotton
                            crop for the last three or four years.</p>
                        <p>It is not difficult to calculate that the sale of the present crop will
                            result in a net gain to the agricultural community of at least five
                            millions sterling in excess of last year's profits, and this will have a
                            far reaching effect on the trade of the country. The fellisheen are
                            indeed the most properous farmers in the <cb n="5"/>world, and their lot
                            is a happy one, compared with that of their contemporaries in England
                            for example. Their taxation is so slight as to be scarcely felt, and the
                            Government continues a polict of remitting taxes steadily every year
                            although it is generally considered that the money thereby involved
                            might be better applied to the execution and extension of public work.
                            This polisy is carried occasionally beyond reasonable bounds to the
                            detriment of the community in general, as in the case of the river
                            navigation, where their release from license and registration, as well
                            as from the formre taxation, has placed the boat owners beyond the reach
                            of even ordinary control.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>SCARCITY OF LABOUR</head>
                        <p>Labour continues to become more scarce and much more costly to owing to
                            the marvellous increase of agricultural prosperity, which now retains
                            the able-bodied in the rural districts the whole year round. THe demand
                            in the cities is greatly in excess of the supply, and every branch of
                            trade is more or less hampered by the difficulties of such a situation.
                            Building operations are seriously delayed, and this is a special
                            grievance at a moment when numerous schemes have been undertaken for
                            urban extension or reconstruction. To give some idea of the movement in
                            their direction I may mention that during a drive round Cairo a few days
                            ago I counted 500 blocks of dwelling houses and offices under
                            construction</p>
                        <p>How to deal with the independent Egyptian workmen who will throw down
                            their tools and leave the job on a slight reprimand is a question that
                            bristles with difficulties, and as the Governmetn is obliged to come
                            into competiion with trade in order to carry out public works, there
                            seems no prospect of discovering an early solution to this labour
                            problem. Skilled workmen are no longer to be got, as they quickly star
                            business on their own account after discovering the value of their
                            superior intelligence. Workmen imported from Italu and Greece have been
                            found generally too ignorant to be satisfactory, and English workmen are
                            considered the best. If it were possible for the Government to appoint a
                            local commission to inquire into the conditions of labour, I believe
                            that important evidence would be collected, and probably valuable advice
                            might be obtained in regard to the method of dealing with this problen
                            on a comprehensive scale. </p>

                        <head>PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE INSTITUTIONS</head>
                        <p>THe creation of a large number of joint stock companies during that past
                            five years has been the means of drawing more general attention to legal
                            questions. Egypt possesses none of the ordinary machinery for general
                            legislation, and under the existing sysem it is impossible to adapt its
                            laws to the growing requirements of the country. The day has arrived
                            when, as Lord Cromer predicted years ago, the burden of the
                            Capitulations must be readjusted; and, in his annual report published
                            alst April he explained the general nature of his plan for providing the
                            country with suitable legislative institutions. He asl invited the local
                            Press and Chamber of COmmerce to express their opinion on the subject.
                            Perhaps the most interesteding of Lord Cromer;s proposals is the
                            creation of a separate legislative council composed of subjection of the
                            Powers which were partied in the institution of the mized tribunals.
                            Legislation passed by a majority of this council, and promolgated by the
                            Egyptian Government, with the assent of the British Government, would be
                            bindin on all foreigner sresident in Egypt. .The existing Conseluar
                            Courts are to be abolished when other Courts have been created by the
                            fresh legislation ; and the cardinal point of the whole plan is that the
                            Powers, with the exception of Great Britain, will cease to exercise any
                            legislative funstions. </p>
                        <p>It is difficult to interest foreign residents in a scheme of this nature,
                            and, in the absence of any united public opinion, they are inclined to
                            preserve an attitude of masterly inactivity. They prefer to continue in
                            the nejoyment of their present privileges, and are unwilling to consider
                            any propsed change which might tend to limit them. The most absolute
                            guarantees would be necessary to remove their suspicion that the
                            ultimate intention of the British GOvernmetn is to treat Europeans and
                            Egyptians as equals ; all the European communities have the most
                            profound objection to such an idea.- (The "Times:).</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE</head>
                    <p>THere was a marked improvement in last nights; :Lohengin: iver previous
                        performances, particular as regards the first two acts, which went very
                        smoothly. In both scenes, of the last act, there was rather a falling away:
                        the orchestra, already caantering at the start went off at a gallop, and at
                        times rather disconcerted the chorus. Signa Grisi, too, as Elsa, was
                        occasionally in too great a hurry and now and again a little flat, but other
                        wise fairly good. Sig. Marcolin;s Lohengrin calls for little comment. There
                        were so many cuts in Telramund's part that Sig. Berrisl had hardly scope for
                        his vigorous acting. By far the best in the cast and nearest to Wagnerian
                        requirements was Signa. Chorkawaks's Ortund, the "woman who does not know
                        love." THis was a most telling piece of work as regards to singing, accting,
                        and appearance. Sig. Contini, and Heinrich der Vogler, was also very
                        commendable, and acquitted himself particularly well in Act I. The band, as
                        we have said, left a good deal to be desirec; they were wanting both in
                        vigour and feeling. We should also remark that the female chorus was too
                        sudden and shrill, and we wish they would realize they their frivility is
                        somewhat misplaced in the solemnity of this drama. But perhaps they take
                        their cue from the audince, who keep up in incessant chatter, although one
                        would have thought the entr'actes are more than sufficiently long to answer
                        this purpose. B.</p>

                        <p>Last Saturday, the 2nd inst, and exciting match was witnessed on the
                            Ghezireh ground, Cairo, in the semi-final for the "Egyptian Shield:
                            (Army of Occupation), between the King's Own Scottish Borders adn the
                            1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, which ended in a drawn game (one goal each).
                            The match was witnessed by a crowd of about 4,000 people. A special
                            train in the morning conveyed the team adn 200 N.C.O;s and men of the
                            Dublin Fusiliers to Cairo to enable them to see their team play.</p>
                        <p>This match has now to be plated again, and will be played at Alexandria.
                            The Sporting Club have kindly consented to lend their ground for the
                            match, which will be played on Friday next, 8th insti. Kick off will be
                            at 3 p.m., when an exciting contest should be witnessed. </p>
                        <p>The last time these two teams met was at York, in the year 1895, in the
                            second round of the Army's Cup, when the King's Own Scottish Borderers
                            were the victors.</p>

                        <head><orgName>BRITISH RIFLE CLUB</orgName>, ALEXANDRIA</head>
                        <p>According to the report of the committee for the year 1906, the past
                            season, the seventh year of the club's existence, has witnessed a
                            further development in its usefulness. The number of members, 148, is
                            practically, the same as the previous season, but attendance on the
                            range has increased about 50% and the quanitity of ammunition expended
                            has been nearly double that of last year. Proficiency in marksmanship
                            has, generally, been more than maintained, improvment being most
                            noticeable amongst beginners. Good work has thus been done by the club
                            in teaching a considerable number of young men who were previously
                            unacquainted with the use of the rifle, and in impriving those who
                            already had more or less experience in shooting. Eleven N.R.A "Riflemen"
                            certificates were gained by 9 members, this year 11 members have won 40
                            of these, entitling the club to 4 N.R.A. silver badges for competition
                            amongst these members. Of six matches shot, four were won, and two lost
                            by the club. The military authorities have afforded the club their kind
                            assistance, as heretofore, and the 1st Batt. Royal Dublin Fusiliers
                            kindly presented a handsome challenge cup, at the beginning of the
                            season, to be completed for annually amongst 3rd class members. This
                            aided considerably in attracting the unexperienced to the range, which
                            was the object the donors had in view. The first winner of this cup is
                            Mr. D.V.B. Donaldson. The spoon competitions were well attended, the
                            winners being: in Deliberate finding Class I. Messers, H.F. Dickson,
                            A.G. Lias, W. Lucas, W.G. Jacob, L.H. Rickards (twice) and P. Schilizz;
                            Class II. Messrs. W. Broomfield, R.H. Incledon, W.G. Jacob, L.
                            Ratcliffe, G. Smith, and W.J. Tookey; Class III. Messrs. T.D. Carver,
                            D.V.B. Donaldson, T.F. Donovan, J. Mellor, R. Murchland, W.J. Tookey,
                            and C.F. Townsend. Lu rapid firing the following gained spoons W.B.
                            Carlisl (twice). W. Lucas, J.H. Buckland, R.H. Incledon, G.D. Lovel, C.
                            Robertson, G. Smith, W.C. Hubble, J. Mellor and W. J. M. Whitfield. The
                            Champion Cups were won, in Class I., by Mr. P. Schilzii, and in Class
                            II. by Mr. W.C. Jacob, and the Donegall badge by Mr. A. G. Lias. 5
                            Milton badges were gained, as against 2 in 1905, viz: a gold one by Mr.
                            P. Schilizzi, silver ones by Messrs. A.G. Lias and L.H. Rickards, and
                            bonze ones by Messrs. W.G. Jacob and W.J. Tookey. The price of
                            ammunition was maintained at P.T. 3 per 8 rounds throughout the season,
                            which is considerably less than its cost. Owing chiefly to the loss on
                            the sale of ammunition and increased expenses, the balance carried
                            forward to the new year is only P.T. 2264 3/10, as against P.T. 4501
                            8/10 last year. </p>

                    <p>This Company has been formed for the objects set on in the Company's
                        Memorandum of Association, including the acquisition of the clientele and
                        business of the partnership "en commandite" carried on at Cairo and
                        Alexandria under the style of A. Lunghis &amp; Co. as from the 1st January
                        1907, the carrying on of the business of stock, share and produce brokers,
                        and the undertaking of Exchange, Bourse, Financial and Commercial operations
                        and transactions of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>The Company intends forthwith to commence business at Cairo and Alexandria
                        and for that purpose has entered into arrangements for the conduct of its
                        affairs on the Boorses. at Cairo and Alexandria and will enter into such
                        other arrangements as may be necessary.</p>
                    <p>The Directors and friends have subscribed the Company's Memorandum of
                        Association for 97000 shares.</p>
                    <p>The Vendors, Messrs. Achille Lunghis &amp; Co, show their confidence in the
                        Company's future by not only accepting the whole of the purchase
                        consideration payable to them entirely in folly paid shares and subscribing
                        for 20,000 shares by the Company's Memorandum of Association, but they have
                        also agreed to deposit with the Company 50,000 fully paid shares to the
                        intent that the said 50,000 shares shall not be sold or dealt with by them
                        as to 30,00 daring the period of three years from the date of the Company's
                        incorporation, and as to 20,000 during the period of one year from the same
                        date.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the purchase consideration, namely £36,000, to be paid in fully
                        paid shares represents the agreed value of the goodwill.</p>
                    <p>The Company has secured the services of Mr. ACHILLE LUNQHIS as its Managing
                        Direotor for a period of five years from the date of the incorporation of
                        the Company.</p>
                    <p>The services of MR. ARTHUR SPAGNOLO, until recently 'fonde de pouvoirs" of
                        the Credit Lyonnais at Alexandra, have also been remained for a like period,
                        as Assistant Manager.</p>
                    <p>The Articles of Association contain the following provisions:</p>
                    <p>94 As remuneration for their services the directors (other than the Managing
                        Director)shall be paid at the rate of £100 per annum for each ordinary
                        Director and at the rate of £250 per annum for the Chairman.</p>
                    <p>Provided, nevertheless, that if in any year a dividend at the rate of at
                        least £6 per annum is not paid, the remuneration of the Directors shall be
                        at one half of the before mentioned rate.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the aforesaid remuneration, each Direotor shall also receive
                        such farther sum (if any) as the Company in general meeting may from time to

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange thigs as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        we fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in j which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little winner time the Riviera, amid ' possibly not so warm
                        as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than ninny other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far-too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio- Rubattino Co's steamers, which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about the hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a
                        tine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all
                        over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
                        interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by
                        Demosthenes in BC 413, and taken by the Romans in BC 212, when Archimedes
                        was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan
                        temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000' inhabitants, is the capital of the
                        Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in
                        this fine city The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the
                        church of S. Giovannia degli Erimiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                        Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                        worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from J Palermo by the Florio Rubattino
                        Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it
                        without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places j
                        on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The I small steamer that takes you to
                        Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of live hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not he omitted. The Casein« is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Vidale dri Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hit's a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Valtom- brusa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet, above the
                        sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog wheel railway to Saltiiio. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a line
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. Oho of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a ; very convenient half-way
                        lions, between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
