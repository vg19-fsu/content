                    <head>ORIENTAL SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES.</head>
                    <p>It may be of interest to some of the English residents in Egypt to hear of a
                        new movement to create an Oriental School of Languages in London, Prof. Rhys
                        Davids, of Manchester (Professor of Comparative Theology at Manchester
                        University), lately had an interview with the Premier to put before him
                        proposals, which he embodied in a report, "Oriental Studies in England and
                        Abroad." Having passed some years in Egypt, and always having felt the want
                        of a thorough knowledge of the Arabic language, we feel that some of the
                        remarks of the learned savant on Oriental teaching will bear repeating. He
                        remarks : In attempting to state what is the actual provision made at
                        present in Great Britain for the teaching of Oriental languages and
                        subjects, we must distinguish between the teaching of the colloquial use of
                        the dialects and languages now spoken in the East, on the one hand, and on
                        the other the right interpretation of the ancient inscriptions and
                        literature, the right use of the rich historical evidence they have
                        preserved for us. In England no such indications are given by the title
                        used. And the complication between University and College payments tends
                        further to obscure the real facts. In the list of teachers attached to the
                        London University and its component Colleges there is an imposing array of
                        Oriental subjects. Only one of them holds a real professorship. Another has
                        a small allowance, scarcely sufficient for a research scholarship, attached
                        to it. Some, in spite of these adverse conditions, have done good original
                        work, and have been able to invite students to work in that direction. But
                        these have usually been men of private means. Apart from the teaching of
                        Hebrew to theological students the provision made in Great Britain and
                        Ireland is as follows: There is a chair of Sanskrit at Edinburgh, founded by
                        the late Dr. Muir. There are also chairs of Sanskrit at Oxford and
                        Cambridge, the former supported by private endowment, the latter provided by
                        the University. There are two chairs of Arabic, apart from Lord Almoner's
                        annual grants just referred to, at our old Universities. The chair of
                        Egyptology, lately founded at University College, London, by Miss Edwards,
                        should perhaps be added to the list. Egypt has been so intimately connected,
                        through the centuries, with its Asiatic neighbours in Syria, Assyria, and
                        Arabia, that the problems with which Egyptology has to deal are in a large
                        degree identical with those of Oriental research. Prof. Rhys-Davids now
                        points out that the total of teaching of a University standard is, there
                        fore, for Great Britain and Ireland, with a population of about farty
                        millions and with fourteen Universities, as follows: Five chairs or six, if
                        the one of Egyptology be included; eleven titular professorships with the
                        emolumients only of readerships; five readerships. </p>
                    <p>On the continent we find a different state of things, Holland, with a
                        population less than that of London, and with only four Universi ties, has
                        eight fully paid chairs and eight readerships. And if we turn to the
                        countries nearly equal in population to our own, we find Germany has no less
                        than fifty-one fully equipped chairs, besides fifty other lesser posts. It
                        may possibly be suggested, in order to explain away the importance of these
                        figures, that German professors are notoriously ill-paid. That is, however,
                        not so much now the case as it was. And the idea is largely due to the
                        confusion we make between the different class es of professors. If an
                        average be struck between the salaries of all the professors of various
                        kinds--16 (5+11) in England and 78 (51 +24+3) in Germany--the amount would
                        be Kreater in the German average. The elements of several of the more
                        important vernaculars spoken in India are taught at different Univer sities
                        in Great Britain and Ireland to assist candidates selected for the Indian

                        and the Modern History of India are added; and other Oriental languages
                        useful for candidates elsewhere. The teachers are all, except those in
                        London, paid. The Universities vie with one another for this class of
                        students, who pay fees, and the India Office helps Oxford, Cambridge, and
                        Dublin to the extent of paying about one teacher. In Berlin, for instance,
                        an Oriental Seminary has been established, in elose connection with the
                        University, and presided over by the eminent Arabist, Hofrat Sacban. It has
                        an annual grant of £8,000 a year, besides the necessary build ings, a fine
                        library is provided, and the seminary publishes an admirably conducted and
                        very full quarterly journal. But there is also provided a special staff of
                        teachers for their more practical wants. There are, amongst numerous others,
                        two professors of Arabic, and native teachers of the Arabic dialecte spoken
                        in Syria, Egypt, and Morocco. The French have in Paris a very similar
                        school, the Ecole spéciale des langues orientales vivantes. This school
                        likewise is provided with grant, buildings and library. In St. Petersburg
                        the arrangements are again different. There are four faculties in the
                        University, one of history, one of law, one of natural science, and one of
                        Orientalism. The matter of faculties is suggestive. How great must be the
                        revolution in English opinion on Oriental studies before, out of four
                        faculties, one is devoted to Orientalism! </p>
                    <p>The London University is just being built up on what are supposed to be the
                        most advanced lines. When the question of faculties was dicussed, an
                        application was made to the authorities to establish a faculty of Oriental
                        study. Needless to say no reply was vouchsafed. Now what are the reasons for
                        this comparative fervour that we find abroad in Oriental study. It is the
                        study of the origins of all the great religions of the world, and the
                        histories of inost. It is the study of three of the most interesting and
                        original systems of philosophic thought. We are learning that in all matters
                        of public administration, training and efficiency are matters of the first
                        importance. The chief officials at the Foreign, Indian, and Colonial Offices
                        and in the services abroad, and also our leading merchants, have acquired
                        their present high positions by qualities and abilities of a high order,
                        among which Oriental learning, save in certain exceptional instances, is not
                        included. They are apt to consider it of little value, and not only do not
                        encourage, but often discourage it. Yet the list of the exceptions would
                        show that it is not detrimental to distinguished service, but rather the
                        reverse. And we must never forget that the conditions have now changed, and
                        that just as we consider, in our naval estimates, foreign activity, so also
                        we should, as practical policy, make our Intelligence Department, in
                        Oriental matters, at least as strong as that of any two of the other great
                        Powers. The examinations are for the most part linguistic. No knowledge of
                        ideas, of history, or of literature are encouraged. The teachers are often
                        natives, whose education is not up to University standard, and a Uni.versity
                        training is not considered necessary even for the examiners, </p>
                    <p>To sum up Prof. Rhys-Davids' ideas, these seem to be the salient points :
                        (1.) The dominant factor in the situation is the supposed enormous wealth of
                        our old Universities, and the corollary that is always drawn; that is, the
                        pernicious and fatal one that Government should do nothing for higher
                        education in England. (II.) Our competitors abroad have taken, in recent
                        years, very judicious and im portant steps towards supplying their existing
                        deficiencies both in university teaching, and also in technical training in
                        these matters, (III.) The funds abroad are provided entirely by Government,
                        and the fees charged to students are either non-existent, or so small as to
                        be scarcely worth consideration.(IV.)Oriental history should be assigned the
                        importance it deserves in the schools of history at our Universities, and
                        every candidate in history should be compelled to show # moderato
                        acquaintance with the main results of Oriental research in this department.
                        (V.) Oriental philosophy should be recognised in the schools of philosophy
                        at our Universities; and every candidate should be compelled to show a
                        moderate acquaintance with its main features. (VI.) The ideal would be one
                        school in London, managed and governed on the same lines as the school in
                        Berlin,and branch schools both in Bombay and in some place in the Far East. </p>

                            the Bgyptisne the soppleness and the perfectibility of her official
                            policy. "Who would dare affia that England, who has given autonomy to
                            Canade, Australis, and the Transvaal, and is about to give it to the
                            Orange Colony, will not decide one day that the time has come in her own
                            interest, to grant autonomy to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The Tempa concludes by saying that when England judges Egypt to be ripe
                            for the fuller measure of autonomy it is certain she will grant it. </p>

                            <p>The earthquake bad been preceded by absolutely no warning: the
                                weather was warm, and the sky cloudless. People were indoors or
                                lounging on the piazzas when suddenly quivering blow was felt
                                followed by an instant of suspense, the succession of shocks which
                                brought down the tottering buildings. The population rushed to the
                                race course or the hills, where they are remaining in a state of
                                panic. Black preachers are exhorting them to repentance. </p>
                            <p>The work of rescue devolves obiefly upon the whites, the terrified
                                negroes refusing to work. The weather is fortunately dry, but an
                                outbreak of fever is feared owing to the destruction of the water
                                supply. </p>

                                persons have been killed. Many thousand persons are homeless and
                                famine is imminent. Money is useless. Provisions are urgently

                                has been broken up. 300,000 destitate people are proceeding
                                homewards. Terrible scenes are witnessed. It is estimated that
                                250,000 homan beings are doomed to death in the Tsing Kiang Pa
                                district alone. 400,000 persons will probably perish in Antong,
                                where every home visited has been found to contain dead or dying.

                        <p>Dr. Paris Nimr, editor of "Al Mokattam," senda the following letter to
                            the "Times" : </p>
                        <p>Sir,- In a letter to the Timer" published December 13, 1906, Mr. J. M.
                            Robertson, M.P. makes some remarks which call for elveidation on my
                            part. </p>
                        <p>On my retarn to Egypt from a visit to England last autumn I found that a
                            large section of the Egyptian publie was still labouring under the
                            illosion that great changos, both political and admioistrative, were
                            imminent in Egypt. It was still believed that British Liberala wers in
                            sympatby with the so-called Nations lists in Egypt, and that, after
                            pleading their cau88 and farthering their aims both in Parliament and in
                            the Liberal Press, a section of the Radioals bad prevailed on the
                            Eaglish Goveroment to make a far-reaching change in the present
                            administration of Egypt. I therefore thought that, if I laid b.fore the
                            Egyptian poblio some of the impressiona I received from converaations
                            with different persons in Bagland, I might help to dispel that illosion
                            and to restore that perce of mind whioh was greatly perturbed last
                            summer by things said and written in England and reported with
                            exaggeration in Egypt. I published a series of articles, in which I
                            disclaimed every intention of reporting interviews or giving the exact
                            words of the persons I mentioned and laid before my readers the
                            impressions their words left on my mind </p>
                        <p>Your Cairo Correspondent referred to these articles and made a speoisl
                            mention of ore or two of the topios I mentioned briefly in the account I
                            gave of my meeting with M. Robertson in London. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson found that what your Cor. respondent mentioned was oited by
                            me "with general accaraoy" except two points, where, he says, I ascribed
                            my own views to bim. As to the first point, "abandon Bgypt to itsell," I
                            may say it was not mentioned in "Al Moksttam." It appeared in your
                            Correspondent's letter, doabt'es through a mistranslation of my Arabic.
                            What I publiebedia 'AlM kattam" was that Mr. Ro' ertion and other
                            Ratios's "would not soffor Bgypt to be given back to the Tarks or to
                            retarn to 'y bing like the coadition, and the administration from which
                            it soffered befsre the Briti-b0c00pation. As to the second point, fail
                            to find any statement in "Al Mokattam" that represents Mr. Rɔbertson as
                            concurring in that polioy of matual exasperation among the sections of
                            the Egyptian Pre a." H refers to what your Correspondent mentioned aboat
                            the policy of Mastaphs Pasha Kamel. What I mentioned about Mustapha was
                            to this off tot :-Ho had enoceeded in making people in Bgypt believe
                            that R dieals were his moothpiece, who expressed his view in Par. lia
                            nent and in the Press, sapported his policy, adopted his ains, and
                            approved of his attitude. I will not give th 1 words Mr. Robartson used
                            when the allegations were brought to his potice, but will simply say
                            that he denied; being well aware of the attitude of Mostapba in his
                            paper and of the source from wb ch be derived his title of Paabs. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson cannot demor to this state ment. Indeed, be concurred in it
                            in his let ter to "The Times" wbere be described as false every
                            statement that represented him as Mus. tapbs Kamel's mouthpiece. I ny
                            add bere that I abstained from giving Mr. Rbertson's words referred to
                            above in their exit form, to avoid be idea of representing him as
                            "18persing" Mustapha Kamel. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertsou says: - Naturally, Dr. Nimr say, nothing of my criticism of
                            his owo policy." He is not right there, as I refarred in "Al. Mokattam"
                            to his views and oriticism in the Deniabwai affair which I might hava
                            easily passed unnoticed considering that they bad do special bearing on
                            my auhjaot. </p>
                        <p>Mr. Robertson is equally wrong in asoribing to me tb viw that B yot
                            sbould never be left to i-self. It is an undoubtel tact that I, as well
                            as my paper, bave always tro: gly supported the British occupation of
                            Bgypt But we do so in obsideration of the great blessings that this
                            occupation showe 8 oa Bzypt. I do wish, bot lees han any other, that
                            Bzypt will one i'ay be lett, to itself But I also wish that that day may
                            o me wben we, who kuow the ins Sud outs of Biyot and whose live and
                            interest are at stake in Bgypt, feel snre that Bgypt will neitbergo back

                        <head>FRENCH OPINION.</head>
                        <p>In a leading article in "La Réforme" M. Raoul Canivet asks if Mr.
                            Robertson really thinks his enquiry sufficiently serious simply because
                            he has enjoyed the hospitality of native notable', which is always
                            graciously extended. Mr. Robertson, continues our confrère, also visited
                            the celebrated village of Danishwai, probabiy to set k inspiration, in
                            lieu of information, as to events which many would doubtless wish to
                            wipe from al memory, as they cannot deny their having taken place. In
                            that a good way of investition Of course we quite understand that the
                            Egyptian Nationalists will be pleased at the M. Pi'. pilgrimage to
                            Denishwai; but is got the danger run, even to the interests sbich it is
                            pretended to serve, of awakening aopes which are difficult to realised
                            The Na <cb n="4"/> tionalist party strives to persuade England to grant
                            Parliamentary Constitution to Egypt, which is incontestably its right;
                            bat is it the right course to take in order to show that the inhabitants
                            of this country are ready, by bringing up the souvenir of this painfal
                            incidenti Mr. Robertson's visit to Denishwat oan Only have a symbolical
                            siguifiosnoe, It is an Boglielmat, and Member of Par liament, who has
                            thought fit to enter this anexpected chapter in his enquiry. It is bis,
                            nd not our business. But unless the Liberal Party in power disavow Lord
                            Cromer's polioy, the notion of Mr. Robertson runs the risk of being
                            awkward. </p>
                        <p>We have been told, and Sir Vincent Corbett took osro to repeat it in a
                            docom gnt that has received the approval of his chiet, that Britain must
                            maintain an armed foroe to face events whioh it is thought wise to
                            foresee publicly. Would it not be preferabla in such ciroomstancer, on

                            among the still ignorant people of the Nile Valley! We Europeans are
                            reproached of defending tbe Capitulations : wby on both sides is the
                            necessity of their existenourged more than ever before 1 Bat Mr.
                            Robertson is wise, and until better informed we hope that he will give
                            wise counsel to most of those who call themselves his friends in Bgypt.
                            We hope, also, conclades our contemporary, that he will complete his et
                            quiry with a reference to the foreign colonies, even the British. It is
                            only thus that he can flatter bim elf with writing a book somewhat

                        con'emporary </p>
                    <p>Duty mean that which we owe, and we have all four kinds of dotieso God, to
                        mna to! ourselver, and to dumb animals. This last! kind of daty is too often
                        forgotten by boys who do not think. In many Onges thry do not mean to be
                        uokind, but they forget what they Are to those dumb creatures who cannot
                        remonstrate, as Balasm's ass is said to have dove, bat whose very dambass
                        sbould plead for them. </p>
                    <p>St. Francis Assisi used to speak of my | brother the ass, my sister the ow,
                        and so ontoremind himself and others that the same Heavenly Father allowed
                        both to be born. </p>
                    <p>With those remarks by way of prefnos I shall briefly describe a very
                        interesting place whioh I visited the ctber day. It is a hospital tor
                        animals sitaated in Cairo, whore I live. </p>
                    <p>In some ways the Bgyptians are kind to their animals, and in othars very
                        cruel. They are reared with them, because wheep, gosta, donkeys, and even
                        horses live frequently in the tents and mod buts whiob they inbabit thom.

                        not kind to I tbem. Carriage-drivers in Cairo will put on their horses usele
                        aly orgel bearing reins, and ply their whips even when the animals are doing
                        their best. </p>
                    <p>The saddest sight at this hospital is that Tof young animals premstorely worn
                        ont. This should be a warning to boys not to bom the candle at both ende.

                        <p>Sir, - In reference to your artio's to the above, and to the letter on
                            the amo vobijat haded "Le Canal Mabmondiok," allow me to state that such

                            should be made except as a temporary arrangement: The remodelling of the
                            existing canal may be put on one side; ovan after spending thoasande
                            apun it, it still remains the Mahmondieb Canal with all its
                            inconvenienon. Some time ago I wus consulted on the matter hy oortsin

                            either coming or going by caual or railway Based on the lives I had

                            discharging and loading of good. The principal points recognised in my

                        <p>2'. The canal would be of sufficient width to allow frea acoess to the
                            port of Alex Andris for the jánotion with the existing canal and without
                            chatrooting boats nociorad to the whartel. </p>
                        <p>3'. Goods can be unloaded from stormers into lighters in the barbour and
                            brought alongside the shdonshis without recours to osrts, and vice ver4. </p>
                        <p>4'. Goods coming by rail owo be apka led into lighters direct and
                            conveyed to ship's side, or vice versa. </p>
                        <p>5'. The Minet el Basdal quartør would be relieved of the great proanure
                            of traffio in the streets and the sotton pressing basitions there would
                            in a few years be abandoned and ap-to date presses woold be built
                            alongside the oans, rejeiving their cotton by bont or rail and after
                            prossing loading on highters, the whole of the handling being done by
                            machinery. </p>
                        <p>6'. The capacity of the State Railway would be increased enormously, and
                            on sooount of the eavy loading and uploading of trucks hey would be
                            utilized to grantor extent tban at the present moment. </p>
                        <p>7'. A direct road wald be made into the centre of the town oo inected
                            with the truthway system. </p>
                        <p>8'. The bridge connecting both sides of my sobems would be placed at
                            sobra beight me to allow ses borne traffi, fa lightere to pass ander
                            without opening. These bridge, being opened by sleotricity, would be
                            opened mod closed and the time of opening and closing recorded
                            automatically; and the time taken to do this woald te less this how
                            lokan to release the looking gear of the existing bridges. . </p>
                        <p>9'. Further included in the scheme was the Alternative, instead of
                            joining the present canal near Nousbs, of dredging a navigable channel
                            across Mariout lake joining the Mahmoudieb near the Def sotion Masraf,
                            between Bobet Komobor and Katr Dawar. </p>
                        <p>From an engineering point of view there are no difficulties: the question
                            is simply one of money. </p>
                        <p>The proposal made by your correspondent to widen the existing anal would
                            worist the presont traffis. It must, bowever, be borne in mind that all
                            goods to and from the barbour mast have recourse to oprts, and we the
                            cost of labour is beooming heavier daily the samo pay be asid of the
                            keep of males horeyote again; the ingressed extra amount of ourting
                            through the streets would mean more expense for tbe apkeep of the
                            street, which would fall apos the Manicipality. I am not writing this to
                            commence polemios on ths salj ot, it being of too vital an importance,
                            and if Alexandria wishes to kep its tra to it bas to look ahead - not
                            for ten years bat for a sentary. </p>
