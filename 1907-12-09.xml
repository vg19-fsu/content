                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE SUDAN REPORT FOR 1906</head>
                    <p>"The Egyptian Sudan covers an area of 950,000 square miles-that is to say it
                        is more than twice as big as France and Germany together. Of this past
                        extent of country, only <cb n="6"/> about 1,876 square miles are cultivated.
                        The remainder consists of desert, ramp and primaeval forest."</p>
                    <p>Such is the description of the Sudan with which Lord Cromer prefaces his
                        remarks on the general conditions of the country in the report of 1906 which
                        has been recently issued, but the next remarks are of a more comforting
                        nature for we read that the area of cultivation has increased by 303,770
                        seres from 1905 to 1906, and that there was also an increase of over 9,000
                        in the area of land, brought under artificial irrigation</p>
                    <p>The greatest difficulty which the Administration of the Sudan has to deal
                        with in the lack of labour, for the demand for even unskilled labour far
                        exceeds the supply, and though the training of the younger inhabitants will
                        doubtless do much to reduce the difficulty as time goes on, in the meantime
                        it is a serious draw back to the rapid development of the country, as it
                        must be many years before sufficient boys have been trained to dope with the
                        ever increasing demand</p>
                    <p>As soon as the bridge which has already been commenced over the Nile between
                        Khartoum North is complete, it is proposed to construct a railway up the
                        middle of Ghezira and so form an outlet for produce from this province to
                        stations on the White and Blue Niles.</p>
                    <p>The question of transport is of course one of the most important, as without
                        quick means of pouring agricultural and other products into the markets much
                        of the value is necessarily lost, either by the increased cost which a
                        longer transport by Camel or such means is bound to entail, or else by
                        depreciation in the goods themselves, therefore it would seem that the loan
                        of a quarter of a million which the Badan Government has obtained in order
                        to build the bridge was certainly well advised, and likely to meet with
                        almost immediate returns</p>
                    <p>The conclusions arrived at by the Government as regards the cotton fields of
                        the Sudan are somewhat disappointing the following remarks by Mr. Ernest
                        Bonus, Director of Lands and Agriculture will clearly show: - "The prospects
                        of Egyptian cotton in the Sudan appear not to be very brilliant in the
                        immediate future. In the Province of Halfa, a European cultivator finds it
                        is not a sufficiently successful crop, while the natives will not take
                        trouble enough with it and have is one to instruct them. In Dongols, it is
                        found that, for the present at any rate, the growing of cereals is more
                        remunerative, though some individual cultivators might apparently succeed.
                        In the Blue Nile Province, not much result has been obtained, though the
                        quality of what is grown is good. No great increase can be expected before
                        some irrigation system is introduced, because the Egyptian plant can only be
                        cultivated on wakieh land, which it occupies for eight months of the year,
                        without producing anything in the way of torage for the sakieh cattle. The
                        prices obtainable are also too low to encourage cultivation on a large scale
                        for export, though small quantity, sufficient for the local market, pays
                        well enough The Governor of the White Nile province reports some enterprise
                        with Egyptian cotton, and the possibility of growing it in his province is
                        shown by the results of 2 acres grown at Duem, which gave 17 1/2 to 20
                        kantars cach with only three artificial watering. In the Berber Province,
                        the natives will not grow Egyptian cotton. The seed is expensive, losses
                        from locusts and white ants are a deterrent, and the prions obtainable are
                        not attractive. The low prices are probably due to the inferior quality of
                        the erop, which is carelessly cultivated. The possibility of growing the
                        crop is, nevertheless, shown by the fact that 8 acres on the Government farm
                        produced 28 kantars of ginned cotton , but the risk is also made clear by
                        the destruction by locusts of 17 acres (the whole ares attempted) in the
                        Sudan Experimental Plantation Syndicate's land at Zeidab. In the Khartoum
                        Province, an increase of about 400 acres is reported in the area under
                        cotton, but freights are heavy, and though the local demand is increasing,
                        it is not expected that next year will show further increase in the screage.
                        In the meantime, Egyptian seed is in fact being imported. The impediments
                        appear to be the cost of labour and freight. The latter might be reduced by
                        ginning the cotton before dispatch but until the output is moob increased,
                        no considerable ginning factory would pay its expenses, though a small plant
                        might succeed in the meantime. A start in this direction has been made at
                        the Gordon College ma branch of technical instruction. In the Sennar
                        Province, the Governor arranged small cotton show which attracted 100
                        exhibits, several of which were of quite superior quality. The Governor has
                        also set up a few small gins, which have worked successfully and must
                        largely encourage the industry and facilitate such trade as at present
                        exists. In the Kordofan, Mongalla, and Bahr-el-Ghazal Provinces, nothing is
                        being done at present. In the Red Sea Province, a very good crop is expected
                        at Tokar, where cotton growing is an old established industry. It is
                        gratifying to note that the National Bank of Egypt has instituted a system
                        of making advances to the cultivators on hypothecation of their crops, which
                        secure the producers Against loss arising from dear money or artificially
                        restricted prices. In Kassals, it is reported that there is an increased
                        tendency towards the cultivation of Egyptian cotton, and the local supply of
                        seed (6,417 rottolis) was exhausted. In most provinces, the native cotton
                        continues to be grown to supply local requirements, and in some districts
                        the production is sensibly increasing <!--illegible--> the White Nile
                        Province, an increase of 1,310 acres is reported. In the Blue Nile Province,
                        of the screnge is twice that of last year, and at Gallabat the demand and
                        prices are good. These developments appear to be due to the high Nile and
                        favourable rains. </p>

                            impossible to choose any one character as being more perfectly played

                    <p>The Sultan Tombora, of the Bahr el-Ghazal, who is on a visit to Khartoum was
                        received by the Govenor-General on Friday week. He expressed his gratitude,
                        for the kind treatment with which he has been treated, and for the numerous
                        presents which have been bestowed upon him and his followers. He gave
                        assurance of his loyalty to the Government and his readiness to comply with
                        its instructions, and to rule his people in accordance with its
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday week a dinner was given at the Omdurman Zabtieh in honour of
                        Sultan Tombora and the other Sultans visiting Omdurman. Tombora was much
                        pleased with the phonograph which supplied the music for the occasion</p>
                    <p>Sultan Tombora and his retinue, consisting of his son, his brother, his wives
                        and about a dozen servants left Omdurman yesterday week returning to his
                        country. He goes back carrying with him pleasant recollections of his short
                        visit to these parts. He has evidently been very favourably impressed with
                        what he witnessed here, and has expressed his desire to send four of his
                        sons to Khartoam to be educated at Gordon College.</p>
                    <p>The "Sudan Times" says —</p>
                    <p>The Sultan's a very genial person. He speaks Arabic fairly well. Asked about
                        his age he was not able to give a reply ; the Niams Niams</p>
                    <p>do not seem to have a regular way of measuring time. But by his looks one can
                        judge that he is between fifty and sixty years old He states that when
                        Zabeir Pasha was a young boy, and has no clear recollection of him. </p>
                    <p>Tombora has a large number of wives, exact number of whom he does not know ;
                        nor does he seem to know the exact number of his children. But they are not
                        less than fifty, a number of whom are already established as sheiths of
                        different districts within his dominions. His successors as Sulton, will not
                        be his oldest son, but one of his younger children whom he has designated an
                        account of being more intelligent than the others, and hence more
                        promising.</p>
                    <p>He says that the Niam Niams are no longer cannibals. Cannibalism was
                        practiced by them in the past but on very rare ocassions. The people of a
                        tribe never at the flesh of their own tribesmen. But when a man got old or
                        helplessly sick, he was made a present of to another tribe which would feed
                        upon his flesh, returning the favour to the former tribe when they had a
                        similar opportunity.</p>

                    <p>The Native Criminal Court presented an unusually animated appearance this
                        morning, when Judge Mohamed Bey Said took his seat on the bench to preside
                        at the trial of the officials of the Ports and Lights Administration accused
                        of bribery and corruption. The name of the late Secretary General of the
                        Administration, Socrates Spiro Bey, was called out in Court, but this
                        person, who is one of the accused, failed to put in an appearance,
                        preferring to remain in Europe. The next ex-official of the Administration
                        called was Attiah Effendi George, who is accused, together with Spiro Bey,
                        of having received a bribe of £54 from Hafez Gobran in order to promote him
                        to the post of chief storekeeper in the Administration. Attiah Effendi
                        George was present. The first witness calledbnwas Hafez Gobran, who stated
                        that he.did not wish to be appointed a clerk as Spiro and George suggested
                        he should be. He asked to be promoted to chief storekeeper, so the two
                        officials asked him for £100 to carry it through Finally he offered to pay
                        £6". He paid first £20 to George and agreed to'pay the balance afterwards.

                    <head>CAIRO OPERA SEASON<lb/>HERODIADE</head>
                    <p>It is certainly a comfort after the ungainly fiasooes of last year to hear an
                        opera decently performed, without obvious failures in orchestra, chorus and
                        soloists. M. Poncet has evidently, though it is early in the season to
                        judge, made a far more careful and judicious selection. As to the opera
                        itself, Herodiade is hardly a piece for any but the baritones: the others
                        have their chance, but it ts hardly a "obeval de bataille" for them. Perhaps
                        the reason lies in the music. One cannot help feeling that Massenet was not
                        in his element ; he was hungering, perhaps unconsciously after the light
                        timeful satirical 'genre,' so apparent in his "Gongleur" or "Cendrillon,"
                        oppressed, it may be by the solemnity and even andacity of his subject. For
                        a moment he rises to it, in the enrty of the priests, but then again the
                        voluptuous, unsatisfied theme intrudes. As to the performance, the chorus
                        were sound all through, as was the orchestra, though a trifle bald in parts.
                        The prophet's entry was marred by overmuch noise in the wind instruments,
                        and now and again in the chorus the altos tended to overshadow the sopranos,
                        and produce a slightly crude effect. M. Soubeyran had as suggested, hardly
                        that chance which should enable him to show the best of his voice, but in
                        the dungeon scene (or it should be grotto) he rose to distinct excellence.
                        His artticulation is notably good and clear, but occasionally his attack
                        seems to hesitate. Mile Magne as Salome was admirable for technique, but
                        also rather colourless : her voice sounded constrained at moments. Mr.
                        Vallette as Herod rose to the part ; his fine resonant voice suited the part
                        and the sentiment of the mosic, and he introduced shades and tones of
                        passion and longing with real effect ; whether he will do as well in other
                        parts remains to be seen. Mr. Loiglio was distinctly good as Phannel; he
                        also has as fine voice, full, deep, and true. On the whole it was a very
                        even, creditable performance, without any of the glaring massacres of
                        downright bad singing that spoilt last years opera. The rest of the
                        repertoire which is varied and interesting will doubtless show what the
                        company can or cannot do. We may at least hope that it will be a distinct
                        improvement.</p>

                        drawn from the credit L.E. 72,000 each administration should first proceed
                        to the claasification of its employees in the new cadre, the pay remaining
                        over after this classification will serve the chief distribution for a
                        better distribution of employments among the various classes of the cadre,
                        according to the needs of service, in such manner as to increase the
                        employments of the superior classes and to accord promotion on to the

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir,—"Lex" has none too soon sounded the note of alarm as regards the
                            anamalousposition of English companies in Egypr having alien boards It
                            behoves, therefore, the shareholders in soi-disant English companies to
                            be "up and doing." So far as we know, and English court has no power
                            that the Mixed Tribanals have any such jurisdiction over the members of
                            the board of an English company are free from any criminal
                            responsibility. It is a notorious that, as a consequence of tis
                            situation, many of these alien direrctors are simply the "dummies" of an
                            individual or of a company having an axe to grind. Let me illustrate my
                            meaning : According to English law, no director of a company can be
                            directly or indirectly interested, pecuniarily or other wise, in any
                            transaction supported by him as a member of the board. But, if he be an
                            alien, he can, with inpunity, vote for the employment of the company's
                            capital or reserves in the carrying out of schemes devised primarily for
                            the profit of the wire-pullers whose interests he represents. Might I
                            suggest that some clearer definition is necessary of the word
                            "proprietor" in connection with the qualification shares of a director.
                            The evident legal meaning of the word is that a director should have a
                            real bona-fide interest in the company whose interests he controls. Is
                            this always so, in fact</p>

                        <p>Whatever the weather is elsewhere, no one Sean have any excuse for
                            grumbling at it in Luxor, and no wonder that day by day fresh visitors
                            are arriving from the North. Each day here is more beautiful than the
                            last, from the rising up of the sun until the last moment of the fading
                            away of its afterglow, there is no moment when Luxor is anything but
                            gorgeous. The atmosphere is dry and invigorating, the temperature warm
                            without being torrid, there is sight seeing and exercise for the healthy
                            and energetic, and the most luxurious dolce far niente existence for the
                            quasi-invalid and one of the finest and most complete hotels, at the
                            command of all.</p>
                        <p>It is less than a year ago that the Winter Palace Hotel was opened to the
                            public : and indeed it seems but yesterday that the workmen were
                            swarming through it night and day to finish it in time for its
                            inauguration. The approach which we remember combered with heaps of
                            broken bricks and debris is now adorned with grass and flower beds; the
                            wide waste behind the hotel is now taking shape As an ample garden; and
                            before many weeks are over will be verdant with grass and rich in
                            flowers.</p>
                        <p>Already there are many guests at the hotel which has been open now for
                            several weeks Close upon a hundred covers were laid for dinner only
                            yesterday, and many other arrivals are expected shortly. The old Luxor
                            Hotel is to be re-opened shortly, and the Karnak on the river bank will
                            again be used as an annexe by both the Winter Palace and the Luxor. The
                            Savoy Hotel formerly under the direction of Mr. Runcovita is to be
                            reopened under new management this season. It has its well established
                            clientèle, and certainly its situation overhanging the river and away
                            from the town are active points in its favour. The Rev. Mr Gross with
                            Mrs. Gross has returned to his duties as chaplain again this season, and
                            Dr. and Mrs. Saunders have been here ever since the opening of the
                            hotel. Mrs. and the Misses Wanklyn too have been back for some weeks,
                            and though Mrs. Wanklyn and one of her daughters have now left for
                            Switzerland, the others will spend the remainder of the season most
                            probably in Upper Egypt. Miss Bruce and Miss Dobie are also back in
                            their old quarters, and many of the other habituees of Luxor are
                            intending to return.</p>

                            "Serapis" spent some time in the vicinity of Laxor on their way South.
                            Mr. Robert Hickens is still here, living on board his dahabesh moored on
                            the further side of the river ; but often coming on shore and frequently
                            taking his meals at the Winter Palace. It is said that he does not
                            intend going further south this trip; but in all probabilty will
                            leisurely find his way down river to Cairo, storing the while many
                            valuable impressions for future use.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Douglas Sladen is also gathering materials for a book on Egypt, for
                            though a great traveller in other lands this is his first visit up the
                            Nile. He is on his way to Khartoum accompanied by his wife, and by Miss
                            Norma Lorrimer (also an authoress) and Mine Potter. They intend
                            returning to Cairo about the middle of January and will in all
                            probability remain there for the rest of the season. Mr and Ms. Holbach
                            are expected in Laxor in a few days time. She is an authoress of no
                            small ability and her latest book on Dalmatia is bigly spoken of Mr.
                            Holbach is an adept in photography, and the reproductions of his
                            pictures make most interesting illustrations to Mrs. Holbach's work.</p>

                        to Alfred De Marco who certainly works hard, and gains his points, as Wun-Hi
                        in "The Geisha." and he is closely followed by Arturo Marzani who created a
                        deal of amusement out of the small part of Beppo in "Fra Diavolo." The
                        choruses and dances are well executed and each opers is well staged.
                        To-night will be produced Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticans" preceded by the
                        first act of "Pipelet."</p>

                        <p>Three more ties in this championship were played off on Saturday. The
                            defeat of the Coldstream Guards No 1 team was unexpected. Their second
                            team on the other hand did better than was hoped for. The K.OS.B. No. I
                            team had an easy tank against the Coldstream Guards No. III team.</p>
                        <p>FIRST MATCH </p>
                        <p>Coldstream Guards No. 9 team versus the K.O.S.B. No. 2 team, was quite a
                            good game, The Guards went ahead at the start and were 4 love before
                            their opponents registered goal, and eventually won 5 goals to I. Capt.
                            Darell was stendy at back and Mr. Tritton hit well and kept his place.
                            For the loners Mr. Furber played the best. </p>

                            played a dashing game ; they are beginning to get into their stride.

                    <p>The Egyptian Delta Light Railway Company issued invitations last week to the
                        opening of the Helouan Casino on Saturday, and people were not slow to avail
                        themselves of this opportunity of spending what proved to be a most
                        thoroughly enjoyable afternoon, and the charming little gardens in which the
                        casino stands were packed to overflowing during the afternoon. The band of
                        the King's Own Soottish Borderers gave an excellent programme of music and
                        tea was served both in the gardens themselves and in the marquee which had
                        been erected at one side of them, while those who were desirous of
                        refreshments of a stronger nature had every want supplied in the bar of the
                        casino. The casino under its present conditions should prove a most welcome
                        innovation to the inhabitants but only of Helouan, but also to residents and
                        visitors to Cairo. The improvements which we have previously announced prove
                        to have been made upon a most lavish scale, and the possession of this
                        pleasure resort, which is absolutely unique in Cairo or its vicinity, cannot
                        fail to draw many visitors to the town. later in the afternoon there was an
                        excellent cinematograph display in the theatre which was greatly appreciated
                        by the audience. The theatre itself has been re-decorated, and the stage
                        enlarged, and we understand that the programme of entertainments which are
                        to be held there are already complete for the entire sens on. In addition to
                        the theatre and bar common to such places the casino also possesses spacious
                        billiard rooms and here there are both English and French tables, and
                        reading and card rooms for the use of general visitors, and a large balcony
                        running round the theatre will be entirely reserved for ladies. The
                        Committee has engaged first class orchestras to perform in the gardena four
                        days a week during the Beason, and also on Thursday nights, when special
                        entertainments are to be given in the Casino. We understand that it has been
                        proposed to hold one big dance a week in the theatre of the Casino instead
                        of the usual small ones at the various hotels of Helouan, but nothing has
                        yet been settled as regards this, though the suggestion would seem to be a
                        good one. The Delta Light Railway Company are to be congratulated upon the
                        way in which they work for the public good. Their arrangements are carried
                        out without a hitch, and it is sufficient to know that whether the occasion
                        is the running of trains to the Citadel to view the various ceremonies which
                        are yearly enacted there, or the formation of playground for the people, if
                        it is the hands of the company above-mentioned comfort and regularity is
                        assured.</p>

                        "Journal of Commerce and Commercial Balletin", of New York. The statement
                        that Lord Cromer announced the fact of such a large amount of gold existing
                        in Egypt as "if it were a discovery", is manifestly absurd aa anybody knows,
                        who has the slightest acquaintance with his Lordship's annual reports on
                        Egypt. The letter is as follows:—</p>
                    <p>Editor: of the Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin :</p>
                    <p>Sir, — In his recent speech at the Mansion House. Lord Cromer refers to the
                        large amount of gold in Egypt, as if it were a discovery made by him within
                        the last few months. But, in 1899, Baypt imported LE 4,678,290, andre-
                        exported only L.E. 1,454,470. The pound sterling is 97.5, which gives the
                        "Pound Egyp- tian" the value of $4.94. Therefore, the net import was about
                        $15,000,000. In 1908 the import was LE. 6,276,806, and the export was LE.
                        1,771,708, with a notexcess of $20,507,093, As Egypt, north of Assouan, isa
                        densely populated country of the size of inm, with six representatives of
                        the Great Powers paid $10,000 a year apiece to watch its finances,and a
                        Ministry of Finance with 356 Europeans, at whose head was Lord Milner daring
                        his stay in Egypt, the amount of gold in the country is more easily
                        obtainable than that of any other country in the world. These facts,
                        however, were carefully concealed for motives which were only too apparent.
                        Lord Cromer refers to the probable release of hoarded gold throngh the right
                        to issue notes given to the so-called Bank of Egypt, This bank has an
                        Egyptian charter, and is international in ita directors, who represent eyery
                        religion except Islam, with only three English names out or seventeen. On
                        January 1, 1905, it borrowed from the Goverriment LLB. 8,967,292 in gold, or
                        say, abont $19,500,000, As Lord Cromer himself puts it, with thinly veiled
                        sarcasm, the bank had "in the conduct of its basiness made laudable efforts
                        to assist the Government" It issued "paper currency" (Parl. Rep. 1906, p.
                        52.)to the amount of (December $1, 1906) L.E. 2,315,889. As the notes of
                        issue were only secured to the extent of a moiety in gold, the bank held
                        L.E. 1,157,694, or say, $5,780,000, as against nearly $20,000,000 which had
                        been withdrawn from the sub-treasury on January 1, 1905, onder the terms of
                        &amp; convention annéxed to that Anglo-Frenoli entente whose mysterious
                        operations have never been fully disclosed. In the single month of October,
                        1906, Egypt imported $28,150,000 withoat increasing its currency by any
                        appreciable amount.</p>
                    <p>According to the consular report issued in Washington on November 1, 1907, it
                        appears that Egypt imported, in 1906, cereals, flour, vegetablespnd fruit to
                        the value of $15,657,845, of which $403,700 represented the value corn
                        (maize) from the United States. In consequence of the deterioration due
                        tothe impoverishment of the soil of Egypt and the practical destruc- tion of
                        the water supply from the White Nile daring the inundation period, by the
                        channels, which have been cut to the south of Khartum, it would seem that
                        the opening up of direct relations between the cotton planters and the
                        United States, with the sale of bread- stuffs for gold only, might securé a
                        supply of at least $20,000,000 during the next four months. From July, 1,
                        1875, to November 1, 1877, Egypt appears to have lost in gold and silver,
                        coin and bullion, over $90,000,000. The method adopted was somewhat complex,
                        although parts of it were dufficiently simple. Any man known tobave any
                        considerable sum of bullion or specie in his possession was "required by the
                        European representatives of various banks and bankers to surrender it to
                        them without com- pénaation, The only equivalent which can now be offered
                        other than breadstaffs is land. It is evident that unless the Government
                        should immediately permit the execution of the Raiyan drainage canal and
                        reservoir so as to reclaim the swamps lying between the cultivated lands of
                        the delta and the Mediterranean, many years must elapse before this resource
                        will be a its disposal.</p>

                    <head>WEAKNESS AND EXHAUSTION REPAIRED. DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS A REMEDY FOR
                        AILING CHILDREN.</head>
                    <p>Mme. Caspeele, who lives at 19 Olytstraat, Ghent, recently made the following
                        statement to an agent for Dr. William Pink Pills for Pale People.</p>
                    <p>"My daughter Sophie incontestably owes her present good health to Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills. The girl, who was em- ployed in a spinning mill, stood
                        in need of all her strength, but she was as weak as she could be. In
                        addition to this she had no appetite, and she digested her food badly, while
                        her healthy complexion completely disappeared. She tried several treatments
                        with no success; none of them gave her the strength which she required. Fin-
                        ally, she took Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and from the first
                        day she entered on this beneficent treatment she began to get better. Now
                        she enjoys the best of health and is at her work every day."</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that this testimonial will fall be- neath the notice of any
                        parents whose children's condition causes them disquietude. It these
                        children are treated with Dr. Williams' Pink Pills there will be fur- ther
                        cures in view, for these pills strengthen the patient, impart blood give a
                        healthy com- plexion, tonity the nor ves, re-awaken the appe- ttite, improve
                        the diges- tion, and dissipate pain. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
                        People are a cure for anemia, chloro- sis, neurasthenia, gene- ral weakness,
                        stomach troubles, sick headache, neuralgia, sciatica and rheumatism.</p>

                    <p>The battleships "Goliath," "Canopus" and "Ocean" are to:be despatched in the
                        order named, when their re-fit is completed, to relieve the
                        battleships"Formidable," "Implacable" and "Implacable" on the Mediterranean
                        station.</p>
                    <p>Captain F.S. Miller, who has been latterly studying at the War College, has
                        been selected 'for the command of the "Goliath," and will hoist his pennant
                        on the Sth prox. Captain Miller is a captain of 1903, and he joined as a
                        cadet in 1877, and at his examination took four firsts and the Shadwell
                        Testimonial. He was a middy of the battleship "Monarch" at the bombardment
                        of Alexandria, and commanded the gatling gun party landed after the
                        bombardment (medal with clasp, and Khedive's Star.)</p>
                    <p>The home battalions of the Coldstream Guards have been laid under
                        contribution for another draft for the 3rd Battalion, at Cairo, whither it
                        will be despatched early in January. This does not look as if the Anny
                        Council intended to disband the 3rd Battalion at an early date.</p>
                    <p>Everyone feels that Mr. Haldane's scheme is the last ditch of voluntary
                        enlistment for the upkeep of the Imperial Army. If the scheme fail, and
                        there is guarantee that it will not, there is nothing but conscription left
                        for it. It is simply staving off the evil day. Mr. Haldane's scheme,
                        according to his own words, will take ten years to mature Many things un-
                        looked for will happen in that decade.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) to the "Army and
                        Navy Gazette" writes trom Crete.</p>
                    <p>"If what is rumoured be true, our stay in the Mediterranean will not bea
                        prolonged one. The battalion came here in March last, and has been on
                        friendly terms with those among whom it finds itself temporarily doing duty
                        ; but it will not be sorry when the order comes for it to go East. It has a
                        sort of local connec- tion with India through its 2nd Batn., the old 108th,
                        and it has been so long absent from that land of true soldiering that it may
                        be considered to possess a preference claim. The Mediter- ranean isall well
                        and good in its way, but it has not the attractions ofa good Indian
                        station."</p>
                    <p>Captain F.M.C. Trench, Royal Field Artil- lery, who has just joined the
                        Egyptian Army, is a smart young officer who learned soldiering in the best
                        of all schools—active service. He was a subaltern of the 69th Field Battery,
                        then in Natal, when the war broke out in South Africa, and he was present at
                        the actions of Talana Hill and Lombard's Kop, and the subsequentdefence of
                        Ladysmith After the siege was raised he served on the staff as aide de camp
                        to a divisional officer. He was twice mentioned in despatches, and received
                        the queen's medal with six clasps.</p>
                    <p>Brevet Major G.K. Ansell, 6th Inniskilling Dragooons, on vacating the
                        appointment of Brigade Major of the Third Cavalry Brigade, has been iso of
                        to re-join his regiment at once, instead of in January next.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel W.J. Baker, Royal Army Medical Corps, has been placed
                        under orders to go to Egypt early in January next.</p>
                    <p>The question of the employment of Position and Range Finder artificers of the
                        Machinery Artificers Section, Army Ordnance Corps, has been under
                        consideration by the Army Coun- cil, and it has been decided that such
                        artificers shall in the future, in common with others of the Machinery
                        Artificers Section Army Ordnance Corps, be under the control of the local
                        Chief Ordnance officers, by whom they will be allotted to officers
                        commanding Royal Artillery for such periods as are necessary. This allotment
                        is to be made locally. When actually engaged in repairing or adjusting po-
                        sition finding and depression range finding instruments the artificers will
                        be under the orders of the officer commanding Royal Artil- lery, but when
                        not required for position and range finding work they will be employed on
                        ordinary armament work under the Inspector of Ordnance Machinery.</p>
