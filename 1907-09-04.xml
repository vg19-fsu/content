                    <head>MR. ROOSEVELT'S SPEECH.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Roosevelt's speech at Provincetown wa in every way worthy of the occasion
                        and of the man who made it says the "Spectator." It had however, in it
                        nothing in the nature of surprise but was exactly what one would have
                        expected. The only surprising thing about it, indeed is the fact that anyone
                        could have imagined that the President should or would adopt a tone
                        different from that which he did adopt Consider the situation. During the
                        last ten years the national Legislature has passed a series of Acts
                        regulating and controlling the actions of the great trading corporations and
                        Trusts. Hitherto, partly owing to Excessive weakness and apathy, but still
                        more to the almost infinite capacity for delay displayed by all branches of
                        the Judicature in the United States, the law has not been put into
                        operation, or when it has been the ingenuity of the corporation lawyers ha
                        sufficed to evade it. At last, however, th Courts have got to close quarters
                        with Trust, and a Judge has actually declared the elementary truth, as we
                        regard it here, that i a company, no matter how powerful, break the law, it
                        must take the consequences in the matter of fines and other punishments
                        provided by the statute, just as if it were a pod individual or a small
                        trading company. Never thele-s, so strange has the notion that eve the
                        Trusts must obey the law grown to the people of the United States, and so
                        ingrained has become the belief that if only a trading corporation is big
                        enough and wealthy enough it stands above, at any rate outside, th law, that
                        a vast number of Americans appear to have expected that the President would
                        shrink back when he saw the results of the law he has called for or
                        approved, and that h would somehow or other prevent those law being applied.
                        He would, it was averred, "say the situation" and "restore confidence" b</p>
                    <p>preventing the "persecution" of industrial | enterprises. These who, in
                        effect, asked tha</p>
                    <p>the Trusts should be given a position | privilege have had their answer from
                        M Roosevelt's own lips. In terms that cannot be mistaken, the President has
                        told his fellow citizens that the law is no respecter of person and that
                        there cannot be one law for the rio company and another for the poor
                        individual That the enunciation of such commonplace should have caused
                        "distarbence," "sensation, "anxiety," and "gloom" in business circles is
                        measure of how far the spirit of lawlessness has affected the mind of
                        America. One might gather from some of the comments on M Roosevelt's speech
                        that he was a red-hot S cialist bent, torch in hand, on the ruin of bi
                        country.</p>
                    <p>If we turn to the text of Mr. Roosevelt speech, it will be seen that we have
                        in no wa exaggerated the spirit in which he deals with the problem with
                        which the United States faced :-"There is a growing determination in our
                        country that no man shall ainass a green fortune by special privilege,
                        chicanery, an wrongdoing, so far as it is in the power </p>
                    <p>legislation to prevent it, and that fortones when amassed sball not have a
                        business use that is anti-social." "Experience," continued Mr. Roosevelt,
                        "has shown that an effort to control great corporations by mere State action
                        cannot produce wholesome results I believe in a national incorporation law
                        for corporations engaged in inter State business. I believe. furthermore,
                        that the need for action is most pressing as regards the corporations which,
                        because they are common carriers, exercise a quasi-public function, and
                        which can be completely controlled in all respects by the Federal Government
                        by the exercise of the power conferred upon it under the interState commerce
                        clause, and, if necessary, under the post road clause of the Constitution."
                        After noting the allegation that the Government had caused the recent
                        disturbance in the stock markets, and ought to do something to ease the
                        situation, the President dealt directly with the question we have touched on
                        above, -- i.e., whether breakers of the law should be exempt if only rich
                        enough and engaged in sufficiently enormous enterprises :</p>
                    <p>"But it may well be that the determination of the Government, in which,
                        gentlemen, it will not waver, to panish certain malefactors of great wealth
                        has been responsible for something of the troubles, at least to the extent
                        of having caused these men to combine to bring about as much financial
                        stress as they possibly can, in order to discredit the policy of the
                        Government, and thereby to secure the reversal of that policy so that they
                        may enjoy the fruits of their own evildoing. That they have misled many good
                        people into believing that there should be such a reversal of policy is
                        possible. If so, I am sorry, but it will not alter my attitude. Once and for
                        all let me say that, so far as I am concerned, and for the eighteen months
                        of my administration that remain, there will be no change in the policy we
                        have | steadfastly pursued. It is idle to ask me not</p>
                    <p>to prosecute criminals, rich or poor, but I desire no less emphatically to
                        have it understood that we have undertaken, and will undertake, no action of
                        a vindictive type, and, above all, no action which shall inflict great or
                        inherited suffering upon innocent stockholders and upon the public as a
                        whole. Our purpose is to act with the minimum of harshness compatible with
                        obtaining our ends. In the man of great wealth who has earned his wealth
                        honestly and used it wisely pre recognise a good citizen, worthy of all
                        praise and respect. Business can only be done, under modern conditions,
                        through corporations, and our purpose is heartily to favour corporations
                        that do well.``</p>
                    <p>There is no need to make Mr. Roosevelt's plain speaking planer. No one who is
                        not anxious, or, rather, determined, to mistake him can imagine that he is
                        any enemy to industry or, to the legitimate accumulation of wealth, or that
                        he has any Sovialistic bias. On the contrary, it is clear that he is to be
                        counted as the best friend of property and of a State organised on
                        individualistic lines. He stands for the rights of property and the rights
                        of the individual against a lawlessness which, if persisted in, can only
                        have one end,--the destruction of * State based on individual freedom and
                        private property.</p>
                    <p>If we look at the President's speech as a whole, we shall see that he is
                        striking against what is in reality the chief defect of modern America on
                        the political side. The story of the politician who was asked to give his
                        opinion on the Prohibition Law is one of those "luciferous sayings' ' of
                        which Bacon speaks. "I'm for the law, but again it's enforcement," said the
                        politician. The people of the United States have hitherto believed too much
                        in the virtue of the printed statue, and have thought too little of how to
                        carry out the law. Careless in their easy optimism, and persuaded by
                        claptrap rhetoricians that the principles of democracy would be infringed by
                        giving their Judges the pay, the prestige, and the social power and
                        influence which they possess in this country-a power and influence which
                        greatly facilitate even-handed justice when millionaires and politicians
                        with a "pull" are to be dealt with, and in no way prejudice the poor man's
                        cause they have too often allowed their Courts to be impotent when faced by
                        great and wealthy trading organisations. The American people have been too
                        apt to think, in fact, that when a thing is ordered to be done it is done.
                        They have forgotten that there is another stage quite as important as giving
                        an order, and that is seeing to its execution. Unless ample provision is
                        made for such execution, it is better not to give the order at all. Every
                        disregarded or imperfectly obeyed order is a serious danger and source of
                        weakness to those who give it. Men are taught to think that it is safe and
                        easy to disobey. If, then, Mr. Roosevelt can teach his fellow-countrymen
                        that they must give up the national habit of passing laws and then
                        forgetting to carry them out, he will have conferred on them an incalculable
                        benefit. The man who is for a law but against its enforcement is a national
                        disgrace and a national danger. Those who tolèrste and are amused by ench an
                        attitude can expect nothing but scandal heaped on scandal, and the gradual
                        degradation of every social and political institution.</p>

                    <p>This report contains a preliminary account of the topography and geology of
                        the Eastern Desert between lat. 22° N. and 25° N. It has been compiled from
                        the field notes of the surveyors and geologists in order to furnish as soon
                        as possible a general account of the district, without waiting for the final
                        results of petrological and other studies which will occupy a considerable
                        time. It may happen therefore that some of the results arrived at in this
                        preliminary report may be considerably modified by subsequent field-work and
                        laboratory study.</p>
                    <p>The topography was commenced in the winter of 1904 when a chain of
                        triangulation was carried from Edfu on the Nile to the shore of the Red Sea,
                        and though this work occupied most of his time, Mr. Villiers Stuart also
                        added a certain amount of topographic detail. In the following season two
                        parties, under Mr. Villiers Stuart and Dr. Ball respectively, extended this
                        line southwards approximately along the 34° 15 E. and 34° 45 E. meridians,
                        the former being carried southwards as far as lat. 22° N. and then joined to
                        the Nile Valley triangulation in lat 23° 10 N. while the latter (Eastern)
                        chain was carried down to lat. 24° N. In addition the members of the
                        Geological Survey carried out as much topographical and geological work as
                        was possible in the time available.</p>
                    <p>The increase of mining operations in this portion of the desert has
                        necessitated the accurate determination of a number of points by
                        triangulation from which concessions and leased areas could be located. This
                        work was carried out by means of 6-inch micrometer theodolites, and was
                        connected to the second order triangulation of Egypt at Edfu, Kom Ombo and
                        Dakka. Three control base-lines were measured which established that the
                        accuracy of the work was well maintained and of a much higher order than was
                        absolutely necessary for locating mining claims. It is, however, of very
                        considerable value in controlling the topography of the western coast of the
                        Red Sea, and the additional cost of the higher class work is extremely small
                        since transport and delays of travel account for by far the greater portion
                        of the expenditure in time and money,</p>
                    <p>A measure of th. accuracy of the work may be in the causing differences at
                        Kom Ombo and Dakka. At the former the differences of latitude and longitude
                        when computed through the Desert and Valley triangulation were 0'.15 and
                        1".9 respectively, while at Dakka the corresponding quantities were 15.3 and
                        0".5. This gives every confidence in the accuracy of the triangulation. As
                        the result of connecting the western shore of the Red Sea with the Nile
                        Valley through a chain of nine quadrilateral figures, an improved value has
                        been obtained for the longitude of this coast-line.</p>

                    <head>THE FINANCIAL ADVISER<lb/>A SECOND INTERVIEW.</head>
                    <p>The Alexandrian correspondent of th "Moayad" has been granted a second
                        interview with Sir Vincent Corbett, in the course a which the retiring
                        financial adviser remarks concerning the meetings of the Council : Ministers
                        during the summer months that | did not find the papers right in what they
                        hay written on this sobject. By customary decree the Ministers replace each
                        other during the absence of others and, thus they have legal authority to do
                        so. It is known that business in summer is not as a rule of special impor

                        for their absence.</p>
                    <p>In reply to a question concerning nativ opinion on Mr. Dunlop's policy Sir
                        Vincen Corbett asked if the Egyptians really object to the educational
                        adviser, to which the interviewer replied that out of the eleven millions of
                        Egyptian people all longed for him to leave the country to assume a higher
                        position elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Sir Vincent Corbett then spoke upon obli gatory education and the impedimeuts
                        which hinder its propaganda, such as money, suitable buildings and the
                        engagement of professors In answer to a question as to whether Mr. Dunlop
                        was returning or not he smil ed and said "I do not know." The correspondent
                        then questioned him upon hil opinion relating to self government and the
                        wider anthority demanded for the Legislative Council and the General
                        Assembly. The Financial Adviser replied that the time for these departures
                        had not yet come, and gave the same reasons as contained in Lord Cromer's
                        report, giving evidence that his political opinions are the same as those of
                        Lord Cromer He was then asked why the Government did not create a Municipal
                        Council in Cairo as in Alexandria and the provinces. In reply he said that
                        he was evidently in ignorance of the difficulties in Alexandria which
                        troubled the Government. He contended that as Cairo was much bigger than
                        Alexandria and was the residence of the Khedive and the Ministers, it would
                        therefore be very difficult to establish a Municipality with a mixed
                        council, and one that would be able to earry on affairs without those
                        differences and difficulties which necessitate the Government infinite
                        tronble. The inhabitants of Alexandria, he pointed out, are complaining of
                        the taxes levied on them, and altogether are opposed to the idea of a Cairo
                        Municipality.</p>
                    <p>The interviewer said that as the Government has opened credits for 64
                        millions, could it not open one for Cairo drainage, instead of resorting to
                        increased taxation, to which Sir Vincent Corbett replied that the drainage
                        project required two millions, and would be of great nse to the inhabitants,
                        who would only have to pay a small extra tax. He was then questioned upon
                        his relations with the Khedive and Ministers. He replied "I am still in the
                        Government service and receiving my salary, and must inform you that the
                        regulations of the Government do not permit officials entering into
                        discussions with press representatives."</p>
                    <p>He then changed the subject and in the course of his remarks said that it
                        behoves the Egyptians to pay special attention to the promotion of
                        agriculture, so earnestly encouraged by the Khediye.</p>

                    <p>CAIRO MOTOR-CAR FATALITY.</p>
                    <p>It has been announced in connection with the recent motor car accident which
                        resulted in the death of a prominent native notable that the family of the
                        defunct have strongly opposed the exhumation of the body as requested by the
                        Italian Consulate in order to establish the responsibility of the chauffeur,
                        and the latter has been liberated.</p>
                    <p>The matter is now closed and it is to be presumed that no further steps will
                        be taken. At the same time it is to be hoped that some sort of regulation
                        with regard to the question of responsibility of drivers and speed control
                        will be very soon established.</p>
                    <p>As regards the latter question, the cause of the majority of accidents, it
                        has become imperative that furious driving and unnecessary blowing of horns
                        be suppressed vigorously</p>
                    <p>Complaints have been numerous and it would be in no way astonishing to see
                        suffering pedestrians take the law into their own hands, as has been done in
                        many cases in Europe.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "BGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,--In "The Man and his Programme" such I believe is the title,
                            more or less, of the "Egyptian Standard's" articles, Hafez Effendi Awad,
                            whose austere virtue bas recently received such flattering testimonials
                            from the Cairo Press, is handled with vigour and severity by the
                            trumpeters of the one and only nationalist leader,-avoid spurious imita.
                            tions, and warned in effect, that if he does not rapidly come to heel
                            and recognise in Mustapha Pasha Kamel the chief of the Nationalist
                            movement, it will be the worse for him. It will be interesting to see
                            whether Hafez Effendi will accept this hint or whether his self respect
                            and independence are sufficiently well-developed to encourage him to
                            take up a line of his own.</p>
                        <p>Meantime the "Minbar," so says the "EgyptTian Standard's" leader writer,
                            has received a wire from its joint editor and co-proprietor announcing
                            that the Times'' has declared in favour of his programme, a statement
                            which has aroused the bitter indignation if Mr. Rudy (or is it Mr.
                            Maloney 1) who devotes three quarters of a column addressed originally
                            to Mr. Hafez Awad to a thunderous onslaught non "Times and Co." the
                            "Imperialists'' and other monsters who are apparently accused - Heaven
                            knows on what little evidence of cherishing so fell a grudge against the
                            blameless Mustapha, that to spite him they are ready to support the
                            ignoble and plagiaristic Hafez ! But, Sir, I have searched the files of
                            the "Times," and many other Imperialistic organs, from August 25 till
                            date bat mot a word of Hafez Awad, his programme or his suggestions.
                            Stay though -- in the "Times' ' of August 26 I see the headline
                            "Manifesto by Mulai Hafid;" can it be that Mr. Hafez. Awad has made the
                            natural slip of imagining that it refers to his programme, or have Mr.
                            Charles Rudy or Mr. W. T. Maloney, who spell Hafid with a "Z," detected
                            in the headline an allusion to the Editor of "Al Minbar ?"</p>
                        <p>Otherwise how are the "Standard's" attacks on the Imperialist Press in
                            general and the</p>
                        <p>Times" in particular, annt Mr. Awad's programme, to be reconciled with
                            the fact that these papers have thus for said no word neither of Hafez
                            Awad, or of his proposals ?</p>
                        <p>GAEL.</p>
                        <p>("From Al Watan") Once again that new self-styled leader of man Egyptian
                            party, Mr. Hafez Awad, has</p>
                        <p>carried the joke too far. He informs his newspaper by wire from
                            Switzerland that</p>
                        <p>Sir Edward Grey has sent him a letter by post paying him compliments and
                            acknowledging the receipt of-bis petition. "Al Minbar" publishes this
                            message with visible signs of triumphant pride, its editors well knowing
                            that the joke will have the required effect among the simple readers.
                            Mustafa Pasha Kamel arrived at his present position and acquired
                            considerable amounts of money from this class of readers by practising
                            the same joke and making the fellah believe that he was an important
                            leader who was received by kings and communicated with party leaders and
                            ministers. That Mr. Hafez should resort to the same expedient this year
                            was in no way wonderful, seeing that the road to fame and gain was 80
                            easy and that Mustafa Kamel was allowed to monopolize it so long. Hafez
                            had only to write a letter to Sir Edward Grey and Inform his readers
                            that he is in communication with the Foreign Secretary. That alone
                            sufficed to make him a celebrity and to make his journalistic venture a
                            success. But he did not stop at this. He received a note from the
                            Minister acknowledging the receipt of his letter, and that note was
                            pouched in gentlemanly terms. Thereupon he became a great figure in the
                            world and he sent the news to his paper from Burope by wire. Sir Edward
                            Grey he says, 'has answered my letter paying me his compliments." To any
                            European reader such an answer means nothing, of course, but here it may
                            lead thousands to the belief that the new self-styled leader has almost
                            supplanted his ival and that he has achieved great things. But deception
                            will not last seeing that "AlLewa" is openly attacking the new leader's
                            day After day.</p>

                        favourable, has become worse to day, and at the time of writing the wind has
                        considerably increased in force since daybreak, and the sea is uncomfortably

                    <head>ASPHALT MINING IN SYRIA.<lb/>CAPITALISED BY EGYPTIANS.</head>
                    <p>A travelling correspondent writes from Beirut :</p>
                    <p>Gorged up with a transitory wealth acquired through an unusual, and to a
                        certain extent, fictitious prosperity, some Egyptian capitalists, before the
                        ebb that recently fol| lowed the flood, began to seek an outlet abroad for
                        the utilization of their superfluous financial energies. Fortunately this
                        country, so rich in natural resources yet so poor in the means of developing
                        same, bas received * relatively good share. An Egyptian of some wealth has
                        been taking an active interest in the cotton industry at Mersine, but the
                        great project whose realization might have a repercussion abroad, and more
                        directly in Egypt, is that of the asphalt mines near Lattakia. These mines
                        lie near Kerrie a village about 40 kilometres to the north east of the port
                        of Latakia, along the route leading to Jisr El Shugur, Idleb, and finally
                        Aleppo; and they constitute a geological phenomenon; as they form a part of
                        a mountain about three hundred metres high, called Jebel Kferie, near Jebel
                        El Ak. rad and Jebel Sahinn. At a height of about seventy two metres, a
                        length of 1500 metres and a width, or thickness of 1400 metres, the asphalt
                        layers extend in one immense and compact mass, estimated at about 200
                        millions tons. I have seen a sample of this asphalt, and, as far as one can
                        judge, by a superficial examination and simple fire test, it seemed to be of
                        a fairly pure quality. A well-known firm of Syrian capitalists in Beirut had
                        sought to exploit these mines a few years ago and sent out a European civil
                        engineer to survey and report thereon, but they finally gave up the project,
                        apparently judging it unremunerative. It is said that the survey was
                        superficial, and wholly inadequate, and that a good part of the asphalt
                        bearing mountain was not prospected through sheer oversight. Many years
                        before an Englishman of Constantinople, allured by these extensive surface
                        mines, had obtained the concession from the Turkish Government, and has ever
                        since been on the lookout for a syndicate to buy it up and exploit the
                        mines, until the wealthy Greek capitalist of Egypt, Mr. Zervadachi, came
                        forward to take up the scheme and exploit it on gigantic lines. It is said
                        that he bought the concession at £50,000 and that a cousin of the Khedive
                        has a share of interest in the scheme, and that he is actually working at
                        Constantinople to obtain the Imperial Firman for the light railway and
                        harbour, auxiliary schemes which are indispensable for the proper and
                        profitable exploiting of the asphalt. In enterparises of this kind the
                        question of transport is a basal element, and it is, therefore, a matter of
                        vital importance for the concessionaires of the mines to have a light
                        railway from the mine district to Latakia, and, also to make such harbour
                        works at this sea port, as would enable ships destined for the transport of
                        the mineral, to operate at all seasons, regardless of weather conditions 80
                        as to facilitate contracts with shipowners. These auxiliary enterprises were
                        sufficiently important in themselves to warrant the formation of a syndicate
                        of strong capitalists, and it is said that Mr. Zervadachi has associated in
                        the concern an Anglo German Company.</p>
                    <p>The light railway that is to connect the port of Latakia with the mines, and
                        which represents a distance of about forty kilometres, has already been
                        surveyed by a well-known English engineer from London together with a French
                        assistant. The pronouncement of this engineer, subsequent to a careful
                        inspection and remeasurement of the asphaltic layers, is said to be very
                        favourable, and preliminary negotiations have already been made for the
                        transport of the material required. It is proposed to build at Kferie about
                        a hundred huts and bungalows, for lodging the workmen and technical staff to
                        be employed on the railway, as well as a station and sheds, etc. Two plans
                        of the railway have been drawn up, and sent to the headquarters of the
                        society to be finally submitted to Constantinople. Two plans have also been
                        drawn up of the projected harbour. In one of these plans the old Roman
                        harbour is to be adhered to as much as possible and the works will involve
                        practically the repair or replacement, as the case may be, of the old Roman
                        quays, still apparent, and the dredging of the bottom of that old harbour,
                        which is now used as an anchorage for small craft and sailing vessels. This
                        old harbour lies to the South east of the town of Latakia, and the
                        breakwater will, therefore, have to be made along the Northern side, where
                        there is a line of natural rocks extending northeast of the citadel (turned
                        now into a lighthouse) until the beach. According to the first railway plan
                        it is said that the line will pass behind the town, and that the station and
                        other railway auxiliary buildings will lie to the South East.</p>
                    <p>The second harbour plan places the harbour outside the present anchorage to
                        the North East, and behind the citadel lighthouse. It will start from a
                        point called Sheikh Saeed and end in the citadel. Consequently the
                        breakwater will run in a North-easterly direction, and the railway will in
                        that case cross the Kferie valley and continue in an Easterly direction
                        until the coast passes by Wady Qandil Derr Sarho, etc. The terminus will lie
                        to the West of the town, where the railway offices, station, depots sheds,
                        etc. will be built.</p>

                    <p>* LACK OF NATIVE SUPPORT.</p>
                    <p>We received only a few days ago the report for 1906 of the Society for the
                        Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which, thong doing great good throughout
                        the country, is handicapped by lack of fur.ds and prevented from extending
                        its work to the degree which many of us would like to bear witness to. The
                        report for the year, however, is satisfactory, the balance sheet showing a
                        credit of L E. 496, while exceptional expenditure to the amount of LE 258
                        was incurred by the Society.</p>
                    <p>This expenditure included a sum of L E. 153 for an up-to-date ambulance,
                        grants-in-aid of L.E. 50 and L.E. 30 respectively to the Port Said and
                        Fayoum Societies, and the sum of L.E. 25, being the cost of constructing two
                        new isolation boxes.</p>
                    <p>The financial position of the Society is now as follows :-There is a sum of
                        L.E. 1,439 standing to the credit of the Society at the Bank of Egypt, after
                        adding the surplus for 1906, i.e., LE. 496, to the accumulated surpluses of
                        former years, which amounted at the end of 1905 to L.E. 943. In addition to
                        this, the Society holds L.E. 500 of Unified Stock, producing in interest a
                        yearly sum of about L.E. 20 A further sum of L.E. 500 will now be invested
                        in Unified Stook, thus making a reserve fond of L.E. 1,000. The balance
                        remaining after the purchase of this stock will be used as a working
                        balance.</p>
                    <p>The sum received in subscriptions shows an increase of LE. 49. This is
                        accounted for by a subscription for LE. 50 received from M. Colonoff, who
                        has taken the greatest interest in the work of the Society and has promised
                        to contribute a similar sum annually. The British and other residents in
                        Cairo have shown their usual generosity in giving the Society practical
                        proof of their support</p>
                    <p>Some years ago an attempt was made through the President, for the time being,
                        of the society to induce some of the wealthier Egyptian gentlemen to
                        subscribe to its funds. A yearly sum of L.E. 18 was collected as a result of
                        his efforts, but this represented the maximum amount ever subscribed in this
                        manner, and it may be mentioned that even this sum is collected with great
                        difficulty. After deduction of the Government subvention of LE. 100, the
                        subscriptions amount to L.E. 222. Of this sum L E. 48, just about 1/5, was
                        subscribed by Egyptian gentlemen. The remaining 4/5 were subscribed by
                        Europeans, principally English officials in the service of the Egyptian
                        Government. These are by no means the wealthiest members of either the
                        European or English communities. In many cases these subscribers have
                        assisted the society from its foundation. It is a matter of great regret
                        that the wealthiest members of the communities alluded to above, should
                        apparently be indifferent to the work of the society, since not one of them
                        subscribes one piastre towards its fund. But it is still more regrettable
                        that the Egyptian community should be so conspicuous showing want of
                        support. Their attitude in Cairo is precisely the reverse of what it is it
                        the provinces as the following figures will show :</p>
                    <p>The subscriptions and donations collected from Egyptian gentlemen in 1905 by
                        the :</p>
                    <p>Fayoum S. P. C. A. amounted to L.E. 115. Mansoura 8. P. C. A. amounted to
                        L.E. 190, Tanta S. P. C. A. amounted to L.E. 183. Assiout S. P. C. A.
                        amounted to L.E. 45.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, it may be mentioned that LE. 1,200 were spent on building
                        the infirmary at Minieh-nearly the whole amount being subscribed by Egyptian
                        gentlemen.</p>
                    <p>In view of the great prosperity at present enjoyed by the inhabitants of this
                        country and of the large number of very rich men in Cairo it is a matter for
                        the greatest surprise that, ont of a total sum in subscriptions and
                        donations of LE. 464 (exclusive of the Egyptian Government subvention of
                        L.E. 100) only about LE 20 should have been contributed by Egyptians While
                        making every allowance for the difference in the point of view from which
                        Europeans, as compared with Egyptians, regard the question of cruelty to
                        animals, the fact remains, and it is not saying too much, that the Society
                        would be justified in hoping to derive an income of at least L.E. 1,000 a
                        year in subscriptions from Egyptian sources, having regard to the present
                        extent and distribution of wealth in Cairo.</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Beirut, August 30. On the 21st instant there arrived by the Damascus train
                        fifty recruits destined to join the Zouave regiment of the Imperial guard.
                        These reereits will proceed by the first steamer bound for the Capital
                        accompanied by an officer of the town garrison. A</p>
                    <p>On the same day there arrived by the Russian Mail steamer "Kormloff from
                        Constantinople the Special Commission delegated for the inauguration of the
                        recently completed section of the Hedjaz grand line to Mydáyen Saleh. The
                        Commission consists of Djevad Pasha, General Auler Pasha, instructor of the
                        technical regiments, and the two sons of Tewfile Pasha, Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs. It is said that Auler Pasba was recalled from leave by Imperial
                        order to join this special commission. Prior to their departure for damascus
                        the members of this commission were the guests of Abdul Kader Effendi El
                        Dana, President of the Municipality of our town.</p>
                    <p>The inauguration ceremony will of course take 1 place on the first of
                        September, the anniversary of the accession to the throne of the Sultan.</p>
                    <p>After the performance of the ceremony it is said that General Auler Pasha
                        will make an inspection tour to Medina in order to study and report 'upon
                        the technical works involved in the final extension of the Grand Line to
                        Medina. It was the same general who some three years ago had, after the
                        inauguration of the Maan section, surveyed several sections of the Hedjaz
                        Line, and I published in book form the notes that he had taken, and that
                        embodied his views and observations on the Imperial enterprise. 1. It is
                        rumoured that the Governor of Medina also announced the departure of a
                        special delegation to attend the inauguration ceremony at Madain Saleh. Some
                        people also say thay that, judging by the rapid progress of the works, and
                        the persevering energy displayed by both officers and soldiers, the section
                        to Medina will be completed in about a year hence, and that the inauguration
                        ceremony at that seared town will then be presided by one of the sons of

                        disposal of Paiek Pasha, Rear Admiral of the Mediterranean Flying Squadron,

                            <p>A serious engagement took place at a distance of eight kilometres
                                from the town. The reconnoitering troops met a party of Moors, who
                                fiercely charged them, but were repulsed by the sharpshooters.
                                Captain Massenet, of the Artillery, bad his shoulder pierced by a
                                bullet. Soon after, the Moors returned to the charge reinforced, but
                                General Grade meanwhile had also sent reinforcements, and the enemy
                                was completely routed. The cruisers "Gloire" and "Gaydon"
                                participated in the combat. (H.)</p>

                    <head>MOHAMMEDAN MARRIAGE.</head>
                    <p>An interesting article on the domestic relations of the Mohammedans, by
                        George S Batcheller, Associate, Justice of the International Court of
                        Appeals (Mixed Courts) o Egypt, is published in the August "North American
                        Review." Marriage, we are told, it almost universal among the Mohammedans
                        There are no "old maids," and very rarely "cocottes," in the ordinary
                        acceptance of the term This latter class is recruited from divorcées, widows
                        without children or other family ties As a rale, no young man is considered
                        fitted for business, or entitled to the confidence of the community, until
                        he is engaged or married Not infrequently, quite young children are
                        'engaged" by their parents or guardians, and it is seldom that these early
                        obligations fail of fulfilment in more mature years. A young man may marry
                        at the age of fifteen and a girl at twelve. These pre-arranged marriages are
                        very common, and it is seldom that the husband looks at the unveiled face of
                        his bride until after the formalities are accomplished. Still, the law
                        allows him to see the face and hands of his intended once before marriage.
                        There are, doubtless, dis appointments at the first interview, though those
                        are usually family secrets; and the bride groom is supposed to
                        philosophically observe that "beauty is only skin deep," and the bride, no
                        doubt, possesses all the other qualities that go to the creation of the
                        happy fireside. Then he may console himself with the knowledge that he may
                        make three other trials in order to fill up his cup of domestic bliss, and
                        the door of divorce is always open through which he may retire without
                        serious opposition.</p>
                    <p>The personal statutes of the Mohammedan set forth in minute detail the rules
                        pertaining to marriage and divorce, and prescribe the duties and obligations
                        of both parties during the marital relations.</p>
                    <p>Article I. provides that all women free of conjugal ties, and widows or
                        divorcées, after the legal "retreat," may be demanded in marriage ; but a
                        candidate for the fair hand can only express a desire of marriage to a
                        divorcée or widow after the expiration of one year. The marriage contract is
                        purely a civil obligation, and may be proposed by either sex, or by the
                        parents or guardians of either. Two witnesses are required, who must be of
                        full age and of the masculine sex, but one man and two women may be accepted
                        as witnesses. The marriage may also be contracted in writing if the parties
                        are not present, and the writing is read aloud in the presence of the
                        necessary witnesses.</p>
                    <p>Like most Baropean countries, the question of dowry or "dot" forms an
                        essential part of the marriage contract. In Mohammedan lands the husband
                        only is obliged to provide a dowry for his bride, which varies in amount
                        according to their respective pecuniary situations. In the absence of a
                        fixed sum, this is regulated by the custom of the province in which the
                        marriage takes place. This dowry is paid directly to the bride in whole or
                        in part, and in case of non payment she may maintain an action against her
                        husband for its recovery.</p>
                    <p>The trousseau of the bride, whether provided by the parents or from her own
                        separate estate which may consist of her personal wardrobe and the furniture
                        of the household-is the inviolate property of the wife The husband can make
                        no claim on any part of it; he may not oblige her to place the furniture
                        which belongs to her at his disposal, nor at the disposal of his guests,
                        and, should be used the same or take possession of any part of the
                        trousseau, the wife may pursue him in the courts in restitution or in
                        payment of the value in case of its loss or deterioration. The intervention
                        of a magistrate or religious authority is not essential; but if the marriage
                        is contracted without the above conditions it may be annulled by a
                        magistrate on the application of either party.</p>
                    <p>There are several prohibitions to marriage which apply to near relations and
                        to questions of religious belief. Mohammedans may marry Christians and Jews,
                        but no one may marry &amp; woman who has not a "celestial religion"
                        "Idolaters, sun worshippers, adorers of the stars," and, in fact, all whose
                        religious belief is not founded upon some "sacred book" are eternally
                        forbidden to | Mussulmans</p>
                    <p>The Mohammedan law authorises the legitimate marriage of tour wives, nor can
                        that number be exceeded, unless, of course, to replace one divorced or
                        deceased.</p>
                    <p>Polygamy among the Mohammedans is regarded as a moral institution. They do
                        not pretend, like the Mormons, that it is based upon divine or religious
                        authority, although they cite abundant precedent as revealed by the sacred
                        books of religions, including, of course, the "Testament" of the Hebrews.
                        There are legal restrictions pertaining to this feature | of the domestic
                        relation. No man may have a | plurality of wives unless he is able to
                        maintain them according to their rank or social position. If they desire,
                        each wife must be provided with a separate residence, and is not required to
                        maintain social relations with, or even to make the acquaintanve of, the
                        others. Should her husband fail to furnish wardrobe, support and servants
                        suited to her estate, or should he neglect her personally, she may cite him
                        before the Cadi, who will require him to manifest perfect impartiality, and
                        to fulfil all his marital duties. The children all stand upon the same
                        footing; and, in fact, children ``born in a household," whether the mothers
                        be wives or "servants," are legitimate heirs of the father, and in
                        inheritance share with their brothers and sisters of the "regular"|
                        household. It is an interesting fact that there are scarcely any bastards in
                        the Mohammedan world-it is not a disgrace to be born of a slave in a
                        Mussalman's household. The father of the present Khedive, Tewfik Pasha, was
                        the son of a slave ; his father, Ismail Pasha, only married her after he had
                        obtained from the Sultan a fireman, fixing the inheritance to the Khedivial
                        in his oldest son.</p>
                    <p>Several of the princes of the Khedival household are likewise sons of other
                        than the four wives of Ismail, and their princely rank, or social status is
                        never questioned. Polygamy is rapidly decreasing in Egypt. The Khedive
                        Tewfik, father of the present Khedive, had only one wife, a beautiful and
                        accomplished woman, still living. The present Khedive has only one wife. It
                        is the fashion," now for all high personages to follow the "European plan,"
                        and one rarely hears of the existence of polygamy among the higher
                        classes.</p>
                    <p>The marriage being consummated, the domestic relation is so minutely traced
                        by law that there can possibly be no misunderstanding as to the respective
                        duties of man and wife,</p>
                    <p>Quoting almost literally from the "Personal Statue," it may be said that the
                        husband is obliged to treat his wife with kindness, to dwell in affectionate
                        relations with ber, to provide for her support, her clothing, and her
                        lodging. When there are several wives the husband is obliged to treat each
                        one with equality, especially in regard to their entertainment, the
                        distribution of his attention and company. He is obliged to visit
                        alternately the habitation of each of his wives, for a day or several days,
                        as he may distribute his time. The equality of this "frequentation" is
                        obligatory, either by day or night, according to his other occupations, He
                        may not give one wife an advantage to the prejudice of her associate spouse,
                        nor remain in her presence longer than the allowed time, without the consent
                        of the other wives. In case of sickness, however, he may visit the invalid
                        beyond the prescribed time until her recovery. When the disease is very
                        serious one wife may renounce her special rights in favour of another, but
                        she may reclaim them at any time. In case of travelling from home the
                        husband may select one or more wives to accompany him; if he selects but
                        one, it is better that it be by lot, but on his return he is obliged to
                        equalise his attentions with those who have remained at home.</p>

                    <p>THE TABLETS OF KARA EYUK.</p>
                    <p>An interesting article from the pen of Mr. St. Chad Boscawen on the tablets
                        of Kara Eyuk. appear in the `Globe". Asia Minor has long been a field
                        presenting attractions for the archæologist and explorer. The mixed
                        character of the population, the varied character of the remains of ancient
                        art, and the rich store of mythological and religious legends of the
                        pre-Hellenic inhabitants, all demanded investigation. The patient research
                        of Sir W. Ramsay shows how much of this pre-Hellenic folk-lore still
                        remains. A series of important discoveries have been made during recent
                        years which serve to connect one of these ancient civilisations with the
                        great cultures of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley. From time to time travellers
                        in Asia Minor obtained small clay tablets written in the cuneiform
                        character. Some of these are in the British Museum, and have been copied by
                        Dr. Pinches. Others are in the Louvre, but the best collection is that of M.
                        Golénischief, in St. Petersburg. It was soon ascertained that the district
                        from which these tablets were obtained was that of which Kaisariyeh was the
                        centre, and corresponded to the ancient province of Cappadocia. In this
                        district were the two great Hittite sacred cities or temples of Boghaz Keni
                        and Eyuk. The French expedition under M. Chantre was able, however, to
                        elucidate still further the source of these tablets, for excavating in a
                        mound called Kara Eyuk or "Black Eyuk," the explorer came upon the remains
                        of a town and temple which had been destroyed by fire, and the ashes gave to
                        the ruin its name. Here numbers of tablets were found, and this was
                        evidently the centre from which they had been spread over the surrounding
                        country. The ruins showed a building totally different from the other
                        Hittite remains. The chief buildings were of brick, and had been built on a
                        mound, the whole presenting a marked resemblance to the ruins of Assyria and
                        Babylonia. The tablets, on being examined, explained the reason for this
                        simi</p>
                    <p>larity.</p>
                    <p>Professor Sayce, in the current number of the "Contemporary Review,"
                        describes and gives tentative translations of several of these documents;
                        but until further material is Forthcoming some of the rather startling
                        elements of civilisation he describes must be received with caution. The
                        tablets were in almost all cases commercial documents or letters, and some
                        of the Chantre tablets are tax or tribute lists. The script of the documents
                        and the proper names show that they are the records of a trading colony from
                        Assyria settled in Cappadocia in about the twentieth century before our era.
                        The language of the tablets is Assyrian ; but several of the tablets contain
                        foreign words, probably Hittite. These tablets show a highly developed
                        trading community-perhaps from the autonomous position they appear to have
                        held a kind of primitive "Chartered Company'' — who worked the mineral
                        wealth of Cappadocia -- gold, mostly alluvial, silver, sopper, lead, timber;
                        also they dealt at a later time in horses, mules, wool, and goathair. They
                        imported in return textile goods -many of the tablets contain lists of cloth
                        and garments. These tablets are of great importance ; for one reason, they
                        show most clearly the antiquity of the Hittite civilisation-the curious
                        people whose monuments, inscribed with strange hieroglyphic signs, are found
                        from Carchemish, on the Euphrates, to Karabel, on the shores of the Ægean.
                        This civilisation must be older, then, than B.C. 1900. These people were
                        traders, and especially worked the silver mines of the Taurus and Asia
                        Minor, near to which their inscriptions are almost invariably found. These
                        people, too, were those who opened up the great trade roads which ran from
                        the Euphrates, through the passes of the Taurus the Cilician gates, to the
                        Ægean. These roads, being open, rendered it easy for the Assyrian colonists
                        to extend their trade over Asia Minor; but these tablets reveal another most
                        interesting feature-the existence of a regular postal service. That a
                        service existed in Babylonia at this time, as shown by the royal and private
                        correspondence of the period, there is every reason to suppose, but here
                        there is distinct proof. Lists of these letter carriers are found; and in
                        one letter the writer says: "When the postman has received his orders do not
                        detain him." In another letter there is an interesting reference to the
                        roads; the writer says to the postman : "You must know the roads from
                        carrying so many letters."</p>
                    <p>This is certainly the earliest reference to a regular postal service. We know
                        that one was in existence between Western Asia and Egypt during the
                        eighteenth dynasty, about B.C.1400; also in Babylon during the Late Empire
                        and under the Perzians, It was fully developed in Egypt under the Ptolemies,
                        as shown by the recent discovery at Oxyrhynchus of a set of postal
                        registers. The details as to the administration of this colony are extremely
                        interesting, because they show a wonderful independence. The chief official
                        was the Limmu, or "eponymous archon," in whose year of office all documents
                        were dated; there was a governor, &amp; chief judge. Soldiers were
                        mentioned, but they appear to have been in a company's service. There were
                        commercial travellers as in Babylonia, and probably the code of Khammorabi
                        ruled the affairs of trade. The medium of commerce was of two kinds. "Sealed
                        money" was no doubt the forerunner of coinage, and it must be remembered
                        that the Lydians were the first to use coins. The other is called "horned
                        silver," evidently the small silver coins represented on the monuments as
                        thetribute of Syria. The existence of this Assyrian colony in Cappadocia
                        shows ns how it was that Babylonian legends passed in to Asia Minor and
                        thence to Greece ; the legends of Gilgames becoming those of Herakles, and i
                        those of Ishtar and Tammuz becoming attached to Kybele and Atys. The
                        discovery is of the utmost importance 'as linking. Greek and Oriental

                    <p>YACHTS AND THEIR OWNERS. The following review of the most recent publication
                        relating to the yachting world, which we extract from the "Globe" will
                        interest many of our readers :</p>
                    <p>"British Yachts and Yachtsmen '' (The Yachtsman Publishing Co.) is a handsome
                        volume, bound in royal blue, divided into sections, and produced under
                        skilled editorship. Its purpose is to provide a summary of yachting history,
                        and biographical notes on the owners of steam or sailing craft built for
                        cruising or racing purposes. When we call ourselves a nation of sailors and
                        refer complacently to our mastery of the reas, our mind's vision is apt to
                        be filled by battleships and ocean liners. We forget what as a people we owe
                        to our "pleasure" craft. Since the days when hardy Richard. Ferris set sail
                        on his "Dangerous and Memorable Adventure" in his new green, much beflagged
                        wherry, and actually made his devious course from London "by sea to the city
                        of Bristow," there have not locked men to emulate his feat, though he owned
                        it to have been "rashly determined." England was still drinking deep her joy
                        of the Armada victory; the Sea Doga of Devon were firing her youth with love
                        of ocean and desire of glory ; and the Dutch across the seas were | busy in
                        their inland waters preparing the lessons her neighbour was ready to learn.
                        Seventy years later, King Charles became the owner of Dutch-built "Mary" --
                        first of His Majesty's expensive little fleet</p>
                    <p>It is a far cry from the "Mary" to "Britannia," "Meteor," or "Valkyrie"; and
                        the story of "pleasure-sailing" in the years between is freshly told in the
                        splendid volume before us. The organisation of yachting as a sport owes its
                        origin to the ardent sons of Father Thames, who built and owned the
                        "Cumberland Fleet'' -80 called after its princely patron-which afterwards
                        became the Royal Thames Yacht Club, and was sailing matches as early as
                        1780. Men of the South took note, and in 1815 I formed the Yacht Club at
                        Cowes. Men of the West were astir at Plymouth ; Ireland was not behind ; and
                        Scotland, on the Clyde, was working for her future victories. At first, the
                        matches were local ; but gradually the true sporting spirit of camaraderie
                        made itself felt, and events at all yachting centres were thrown open to
                        yachtsmen from all others. The Cowes membership became the "Royal Yacht
