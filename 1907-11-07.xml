                    <p>SUEZ, Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivial Mail Liner "Prince Abbas," sailed from Suez this afternoon for
                        Port Sudan with mails and passengers, and she is the first Company's steamer
                        starting the fast weekly express mail services, arriving at Port Sudan on
                        Friday evening in time for passengers to catch the 8 p m. train for Khartoum
                        N. The journey is thus reduced to three days from Alexandria to Khartoum,
                        whereas the voyage to Port Sudan can also be made by steamer. </p>

                        in watching the motor cars and carriages, occupied by uniformed personages,
                        wend their way to the palace to be received by his Highness. The reception
                        was more largely attended than on any previous occasion. </p>

                    <p>We append herewith the full text of Lord Cromer's speech at the Guildhall on
                        the occasion of the presentation of the freedom of the City of London. We
                        give also, extracts from the comments of the leading organs of the London
                        Press as illustrative of the approval with which a discourse of the greatest
                        Pro-Consul of the era has been received. </p>
                    <p>Sir Joseph Dimsdale in the eloquent address which you have just heard has
                        been kind enongh to allude in terms which I cannot but think are too
                        flattering ("No") to my public services. Whatever services it has been my
                        good fortune to render to my Sovereign and to my country have been amply
                        perhaps some would think too amply--rewarded. But certainly no distinction
                        which I have received has afforded me greater pleasure than that which you
                        have now conferred upon me. I thank you most sincerely for considering me
                        worthy to be inscribed on the rolls containing many illustrious names of
                        those who have received the freedom of this great and ancient City. It is
                        one of the highest honours to which a British subject could aspire. I should
                        have done little in Egypt but for the occurrence of adventitious
                        circumstances over which I could exercise but little or no control. In the
                        first place, foreign affairs, to the great advantage of the public and to
                        the credit of the statesmen belonging to both the great political divisions
                        of this country, have of late years been lifted to a great extent out of the
                        somewhat heated atmosphere of party strife. This fortunate circumstance
                        certainly facilitated the conclusion by Lord Lansdowne, or perhaps I should
                        more correctly say the conclusion by that very I eminent diplomatist his
                        Majesty the King (loud cheers) and Lord Lansdowne, of the Anglo-French
                        Convention, which has been received with such universal approval in this
                        country, and to which Sir Joseph Dimsdale has alluded. This approval bas
                        recently received striking confirmation in the very cordial reception given
                        to the distinguished Frenchmen who recently paid a visit to this City and
                        were the guests of the Lord Mayor. (Cheers.) </p>
                    <p>THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN CONVENTION. </p>
                    <p>This Convention, you are aware, has been followed, as was hoped and
                        anticipated three years ago, by the statesmanlike arrangement recently
                        concluded with the Russian Government under the auspices of Sir Edward Grey
                        (eheers), under whom it has been my privilege to serve recently and for
                        whose loyal and consistent support under circumstances of no common
                        difficulty I wish to take this opportunity of proffering my most grateful
                        thanks. The Russian Convention has, I am aware, been criticised by some of
                        our countrymen, constituting I believe a small minority, on the somewhat
                        strange ground that they are not satisfied with the internal policy of the
                        Russian Government. They consider that until that policy is arranged
                        according to their satisfaction no diplomatic arrangement with Russia is
                        justifiable. In speaking to an audience largely composed of business men, I
                        think the only answer I need make to that criticism is to remind you that
                        one of the surest methods of achieving success in almost every walk of life
                        is to pay attention exclusively to one's own business. (Laughter and
                        cheers.) I have derived the </p>
                    <p>utmost benefit from a strict adherence to this homely maxim throughout my
                        long career, and I even venture to commend it to others, more especially
                        because those who have lived abroad so much as myself are aware that we are
                        rather prone, as a nation, to incur the imputation of being somewhat free in
                        offering advice to others about matters which either do not concern us, or
                        which, at all events, concern us only remotely. Foreigners are apt to think
                        that there are a good many affairs nearer home which might profitably occupy
                        our attention. The internal affairs of Russia are indeed a matter of more
                        than academic interest to the rest of the world, but I cannot help thinking
                        that the Russiaus must be left to work out their own political salvation,
                        and that they are not likely to derive any very great practical benefit from
                        the advice of others necessarily only half informed of the facts as to the
                        best line of conduct to be pursued by the Dumas and other indigenous
                        institutions. In any case, although I do not know whether international
                        boycotting is to form part of what I understand is called the new diplomacy,
                        I am, for my own part, sufficiently old-fashioned to prefer the more
                        conventional method of allowing British interests to form the basis of
                        diplomatic action abroad, to the exclusion as far as possible of all
                        extraneous and more or less irrelevant matter. And from this point of view,
                        although, of course, some concessions have had to be made in order to secure
                        an agreement, I venture to think that the Anglo-Russian Convention is
                        capable of the most ample justification. (Cheers.) </p>
                    <p>DIPLOMACY AND PARTY POLITICS. </p>
                    <p>To return one moment to the question of party strife. I certainly regard this
                        matter mainly from the point of view of a permanent official who during a
                        long period of years has had to carry out the instructions of whatever
                        Ministers were in power, and from this point of view I have no hesitation in
                        saying that the tendency of recent years to remove foreign affairs from the
                        acute stage of party discussion has been of immense benefit to British red
                        presentatives abroad. It has enabled some continuity of policy to be
                        possible. Possibly <cb n="3"/>few of those who are not behind the scenes of
                        Government recognise fully the extremely embarrassing position created for
                        an unfortunate diplomatist abroad if he is suddenly called upon to shunt
                        from the down to the up line. The operation is always one of some
                        difficulty, and unless the pointsman be very skilful may even be attended
                        with some danger. (Hear, hear.) Few, also, perbaps recognize how difficult
                        it is, when an acute party discussion begins, to prevent being associated,
                        or at all events to prevent having the appearance of being associated, with
                        one or other side. This is in itself an evil; for the duty of permanent
                        officials is not to belong to a party, except perhaps the party of common
                        sense, whose views are perhaps somewhat unduly ignored--(the concluding
                        words of the sentence were drowned by the laughter and cheers of the
                        andience). Then I have been aided by another adventitious circumstance. I
                        have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of many admirable
                        coadjutors, one of the most able of whom, Sir Eldon Gorst (eheers), has
                        recently taken my place. I wish him every success, and I am sure he will
                        achieve it, more especially if he does not allow himself to be burried by
                        what I must call the faddists in this country, and the numerous tribe who
                        sympathize with them in Egypt, and who look to London as a sort of political
                        Mecca. (Cheers.) </p>
                    <p>THE DRAIN OF GOLD.</p>
                    <p>I turn to another point. As I am speaking in the largest commercial centre in
                        the world, perhaps it may not be out of place that I should say something in
                        connexion with trade matters, but I wish at once to remove any
                        misapprehension from your minds--I have not the smallest intention of
                        alluding to those stormdriven subjects, tariff reform or free trade.
                        (Laughter.) I wish to say something about the drain of gold to Egypt, which
                        I am aware has attracted a great deal of attention, and perhaps excited some
                        uneasiness in this City, I need hardly say it is due to the necessity of
                        financing the cotton crop. It is likely, as far as can be at present judged,
                        to be of annual occurrence, the reason being that the cotton crop is
                        assured. This was not always so. In ancient times when the Nilometer, which
                        has existed from time immemorial in Cairo, recorded low figures, these were
                        terined <!-- unclear spelling --> by the inhabitants "the angels of death."
                        Nor was this a misnomer. A low Nile meant misery, distress, and even famine.
                        I remember 30 years ago, when I first went to Egypt in 1877 there was a very
                        low Nile, and the people in many of the provincial towns were, so I was
                        informed, living on the refuse and garbage they picked up in the streets.
                        Thousands died from starvation of the diseases incident to bad and
                        unwholesome living. This has now all been changed under the auspices of Sir
                        Colin Moncrieff, Sir William Garstin, and other eminent hydraulic engineers,
                        who have been recently in the employment of the Egyptian Government, and who
                        may be fitly called the makers of modern Egypt. (Cheers ) The country has
                        now been well-nigh secured against the vicissitudes of the season. I hear
                        that this year the Nile is the lowest on record, and although the last
                        accounts of the cotton crop are not so favourable as those received a month
                        ago, at the same time it is probable that the crop will be extremely
                        favourable. The result of this is that every year some 25 to 30 millions
                        will have to be found to finance this crop, the whole of which will be
                        exported. A most remarkable feature of this commercial transaction is that a
                        great deal of the money that goes to Egypt never comes back again. During
                        the last four years the imports of gold into Egypt have amounted to 13
                        millions more than the exports. What becomes of this vast quantity of coin?
                        It is almost impossible to give an answer to this question based on any
                        accurate figures or statistics. It is, however, certain that, besides the
                        small quantity which foyda its way into the interior of Africa, a great deal
                        is converted into jewelry. I was informed on very high authority that no
                        less than one and a half to two millions were thus disposed of last year.
                        Hoarding is carried on to an extent which appears almost incredible to
                        Europeans. I will give a few instances. A little while ago I heard of an
                        Egyptian gentleman who died - leaving a fortune of £80,000, the whole of
                        which was in gold coin in his cellars. (Laughter.) </p>
                    <p>Then, again, I heard of a substantial yeoman – a village sheikh as he is
                        called in Egypt – class enormously increased in wealth and prosperity in
                        recent years, who bought a property for £25,000. Half an hour after the
                        contract was signed he appeared with a train of donkeys bearing on their
                        backs the money, which had been buried in his garden. I hear that on the
                        occasion of a fire in a provincial </p>
                    <p>town no less than £5,000 was found hidden in earthen pots. I could multiply
                        instances of this sort. There can be no doubt that the practice of hoarding
                        is carried on to an excessive degree. The creation of savings banks, the
                        increased circulation of paper money, and additional banking facilities
                        will, it is hoped, gradually wean the natives of Egypt from this
                        uneconomical habit, perhaps, but it will be a </p>
                    <p>slow process, as, indeed, all educational processes are slow. </p>
                    <p>THE RECENT "SLUMP" </p>
                    <p>IN EGYPTIAN UNDER TAKINGS: </p>
                    <p>To turn to another point of some financial importance, there has been
                        recently what is called a slump in some Egyptian undertakings. I do not
                        doubt that some individuals who detserve every sympathy have suffered, but I
                        cannot think that from and more general point of view repent occurrences are
                        to be regretted. It may be hoped they will do something to stop the
                        over-speculation which has been such a very marked, and also such and very
                        mischievous, feature in the Egyptian markets of recent years, that
                        over-speculation has taken place more especially in town lands – and here,
                        again, I will give you an illustration of <cb n="4"/>what has taken place.
                        Some 16 years ago the British Government bought a plot of land for their
                        official representative. They paid between £3,000 and £4,000. At the prices
                        which were obtaining only a very short time ago the value of that land is at
                        least a quarter of a million And this is no extreme instance. There are a to
                        great many others of even a more striking it description. It was quite
                        manifest that this period of inflation could not last, and what has now
                        occurred has been foreseen all along by those who kept their heads. The
                        prosperity of the country is in no way suffering. The wealth of Egypt is
                        essentially agricultural. I know of but two risks to which it is exposed. I
                        have already stated that the supply of cotton is assured. If the demand for
                        Egyptian cotton were to fall off undoubtedly great emharrassment would be
                        caused; but I know of no reason for supposing that any such contingency will
                        arise. Indeed, the world's demand for cotton is steadily increasing.</p>
                    <p>PROSPERITY LARGELY DEPENDENT ON POLICY.</p>
                    <p>The other risk is of a totally different description. The financial
                        prosperity of Egypt undoubtedly depends to a great extent on the policy
                        adopted in that country. I take this opportunity of saying that I think it
                        would be a mistake to take too seriously the proceedings of what are called
                        the Egyptian Nationalists, or of their friends in this country. Some of the
                        latter, inasmuch as they appear to me to mislead the Egyptians as to the
                        true trend of public opinion in this country and to encourage them in the
                        hope that political developments will be much more rapid than can be at all
                        possible, I am wont to regard as the worst enemies to Egyptian progress.
                        (Cheers ) When I say Egyptian Nationalists I do not wish to be
                        misunderstood. I am not alluding to those who are in favour of a moderate
                        and reasonable and gradual extension of self-governing institations. These
                        have my entire sympathy, and throughout my career in Egypt I have done my
                        best to encourage them. I allude to the extremists, who exist in Cairo, as
                        also in Calcutta and in Dublin. (Laughter.) With these gentlemen I do not
                        think it is possible to deal. They will not be conciliated save on terms
                        which in India and Ireland spell political suicide, and in Egypt would
                        involve a relapse into all the misgovernment and disorder of the past
                        (Cheers.) It is to be remembered that the East, though very assimilative,
                        does not always assimilate those portions of whatever European civilization
                        it is brought in contact with. Just at present some of the youth of India
                        and Egypt appear to be basing their political conduct on the proceedings of
                        agitators in this country and I notice indeed that, with what I certainly
                        consider almost culpable folly, an itinerant member of Parliament – Mr Keir
                        Hardie – appears to have accepted the ill-regulated enthusiasm of a portion,
                        and that certainly by no means the wisest portion, of the community in
                        Bengal. The agitators in India will, I do not doubt, should the pasion
                        arise, be kept well in hand by the firmness and sagacity of the Viceroy, and
                        of the eminent statesman who now presides at the India Office. (Loud
                        cheers.) For my own part I say I see but one method of dealing with this
                        unrest and disturbance in Egypt and in India. It is to continue steadily to
                        do our duty towards the people of those two countries, to come down with a
                        heavy hand upon extremists should they overstep the limits of the law, but
                        not to be deterred by their presence

                    <p>"The Times." </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer yesterday added his name to the long list of illustrious names
                        that grace the burgess-roll of the City of London. The freedom of the City
                        bestowed upon a publie servant is, as Lord Cromer observed, one of the
                        highest honours to which a British subject can aspire. Lord Cromer notes
                        that foreign affairs have of late years been lifted to a great extent out of
                        the beated atmosphere of party strife. Fortunately that is so, yet it was
                        not so to an equal degree when Lord Croner began his work. If Egypt was
                        gradually excluded from the political arena, it was largely due to the
                        personal qualities of an administrator wbo compelled the confidence of men
                        of all parties. It in other countries than our own the same mollifying
                        process went on, it was again because Lord Cromer, in spite of all
                        antecedent prejudice, won the respect, and finally the confidence, of
                        foreign statesmen and foreign financiers." </p>
                    <p>Morning Post </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer was not content with the formal reply of the courtier, but spoke
                        his mind plainly to his countrymen Keep your toreign policy outside of and
                        above your domestic party disputes ; let its cue be England's minding her
                        own business ; attach yourselves to the party of commonsense, which is that
                        of England, and is a greater party than that of either Conservatives or
                        Liberals, and make it your role in all your governing to pnt first your duty
                        to those governed, regardless of extreme men whether in Cairo, in Calcutta,
                        or in Dublin, or even, he might have added lif he had not credited his
                        hearers with shrewdness enough to extend the application, in Westminster
                        itself. Lord Cromer Jis not the only statesman who could at this moment have
                        given that advice to his country. men, but he is perhaps the only one from
                        whom men of all parties will accept it without demur. </p>
                    <p>The "Telegraph." </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer, by universal consent, is admitted to be one of the greatest of
                        living Englishmen ... Practically every honour in the power of his Sovereign
                        and <!-- unclear -->fellowcountrymen to bestow has been showered upon him,
                        and it will be hard for posterity to rate his work more highly than his
                        contemporaries have done... Lord Cromer spoke most hopefully of the future
                        of Egypt, in a strain that will be quite familiar to those who have been
                        accustomed to read his masterly annual reports on the state of Egypt and the
                        Soudan. He has always endeavoured to put a check on the spirit of
                        over-speculation, which seeks to exploit the development of a country and
                        make it run before it can hardly stand steady on its feet. The material
                        prosperity of Egypt depends upon the cotton crop, and the cotton crop
                        depends opon the Nile. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's speech deserves to be read <cb n="6"/>side by side with the
                        recent utterance of Mr John Morley; and when two such different master minds
                        come to the same conclusion, the ordinary Englishman Deed have no anxiety
                        about either the practical wisdom of the essential justice of a policy which
                        is only questioned by vapouring theorists, who ignore or misread history or
                        who are influenced by purely selfith interesta. The "standerd." </p>
                    <p>It was in no formal or colourless terms that Jord Cromer acknowledged the
                        honour of being admitted to the freedom of the City of London. He spoke out
                        from his heart, and without stint drew upon the stored experience of a life
                        dedicated to the service of the Empere. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer dealt too lightly, we think, with itinerant agitators, like Mr.
                        Keir Hardie, who set themselves to spread troable amongst peoples neither
                        trained nor fit for the mixed blessings of democratie government. He
                        dismissed it as "almost calpable folly," and thought it, apparently, not
                        more serious than the daily scurrilousness of the paid scribes whom he has
                        not thought it worth while te suppress at Cairo and Alexandria. With a touch
                        of good-humoured disdain, he advised his friends in the City of London not
                        to take too seriously the utterances of the extreme Nationalists in any part
                        of the world (Ireland not excepted) </p>
                    <p>The "Tribune." </p>
                    <p>The problems of India and Egypt, as British problems, are fundamentally
                        similar, in spite of obvious differences. If in Egypt the native population
                        is not so terribly complex as in India, there is a far more complicated
                        welter of alien interests; and the "Egyptian nationality" to which Lord
                        Cromer has looked forward is one which will include "all the dwellers in
                        Egypt, irrespective of race, religion, or extraction. Thanks to the
                        continuous foreign policy of recent years ---by which we do not mean merely
                        that Sir Edward Grey has not reversed the policy of Lord Lansdowne, but that
                        Lord Salisbury eventually came round to the Liberal policy of ruling out the
                        Turk - Lord Cromer found himself freed, as he frankly admits, from the
                        danger of serions interference with his work from outside. </p>
                    <p>The "Dally Chronicle." </p>
                    <p>"The duty of the permanent official," said Lord Cromer at the Guilhall, is
                        not to belong to any party, except perhaps the party of common-sense." To
                        that party there is no firmer adherent than the distinguished public sevant
                        whom the City wisely delighted to honour yesterday. Common sense, said
                        Goethe, is the genius of humanity. It is certainly the genius of Lord
                        Cromer, and one of the chief secrets of his success. Lord Cromer's speech is
                        a justification of some words once used by one of the many Foreign
                        Secretaries under whom he has served. "If there is one thing in my life,"
                        said Lord Rosebery, "which I should like to live after me, it is that when I
                        first went to the Foreign Office I argued for and maintained the principle
                        of continuity in foreign policy. My view was this, that whatever our
                        domestic, differences may be at home, we should preserve a united front
                        abroad, and that foreign statesmen and foreign Courts should feel that they
                        are dealing, not with a Ministry possibly fleeting and possibly transient,
                        but with a great powerful, and united nation."</p>

                        seat on the left of the Lord Mayor. Hearty cheers greeted the appearance of
                        the distinguished visitor, and the Lord Mayor said they were very pleased to
                        see Lord Cromer look in on them in that informal way. In welcoming him, he
                        would like to say that if Lord Cromer cared to address a few words to them
                        they would be very pleased to hear him. Lord Cromer: I thank you very much
                        gentlemen, but I siraply called to see the Chamberlain, and I trust you will
                        excuse my making a speech. Shortly afterwards Lord Cromer left. </p>

                            <p>Herr Brand has been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Prince von
                                Buelow declared that the charges were insensate: He regarded the
                                tendencies ascribed to him as abhorrent and incomprehensible. The
                                unexpected appearence of Prince Philip Evlenberg who came from a
                                sick-bed and was unable to stand caused a sensation in the court. He
                                testified that be knew his friend Prince von Buelow from his youth
                                and that he never heard abnormal inclinations attributed to him. He
                                emphatically denied such inclinations himself and earnestly
                                emphasised that he never intrigued against Prince von Baelow. </p>

                    <p>The Money Market. | It would not be correct to say as yet that | the calm has
                        followed the storm in the United </p>
                    <p>States, but the position has certainly shown | considerable improvement
                        during the past few days. There have been further suspensions of banks, but
                        none of these have been of importance, and have been mostly in the smaller
                        provincial towns. </p>
                    <p>The great need of the moment is gold, and the forecasts we gave last week
                        that early demands might be made on the Bank of England has been quite
                        justified by events. Already something like three and half millions have
                        been withdrawn for America, and there is that prospect that more will be
                        required before the stringency is relieved. The constant rans on the New
                        York and other banks has, of course, taken a enormous quantity of money out
                        of cirenlation, from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000 and until the confidence of
                        the public has been restored, it is probable that much of this cash will
                        remain out of circulation. </p>
                    <p>It is reported to-day that a bankers' syndicate, headed by Messrs. J. P.
                        Morgan and Co. has arranged to purchase at par six per cent. New York City
                        Revenue bonds to the amount of 30,000,000 dollars, with the option of
                        acquiring a further 20,000,000 dollars in bonds on the same terms. It is
                        stated that a large portion of this issue will be marketed abroad, in which
                        case further gold will be taken from London for America. </p>
                    <p>Orders have been received at the Mint at Philadelphia for the immediate
                        coinage of 15,000,000 dollars in double eagles (gold 20dollar pieces) in
                        order to relieve the stringency. </p>
                    <p>The heavy exports of gola to America have left the directors of the Bank of
                        England no option but to increase their official minimum to 59 per cent. It
                        is believed that this will have the effect of attracting gold from the
                        Continent, and of checking the demands from the States. </p>
                    <p>The reserve this week shows a reduction of no less than £3,185,000. The
                        exports of gold amounted to £2,761,000 (i.e. up till Wednesday) of which
                        £465,000 went to Egypt, and the stock of coin and bullion is down
                        £3,044,000, while the Active Note Circulation has risen £140 000. </p>
                    <p>The total reserve now stands at £20,834,000, as compared with £18,157,000 a
                        year ago, and the proportion to liabilities, is 39.91 per cent. as against
                        365 per cent. last year. An interesting feature of the return is the advance
                        of £5,066.000 in "Other" Securities in con sequence of the heavy discounting
                        and loan business done by the Bank during the past week. </p>
                    <p>After the announcement of the rise in the Bank rate, the joint stock banks
                        increased their rates for deposits to 4 per cent and the discount houses are
                        now allowing 4 and 47 per cent. for call and notice respectively. Three
                        months' paper was quoted at the close 54-58 per cent.</p>

                        during the past week. The fortnightly settlement was awaited with no little
                        anxiety, as it was known that in some quarters there were considerable
                        differences to be met. It is therefore very satisfactory to know that only
                        two failures, and these not of importance, have been announToed. This
                        favourable result of the settlement has naturally done much to relieve the
                        feeling of depression which was general, and the tone during the whole of
                        yesterday was quite cheerful. The advance in the Bank rate had | been
                        anticipated, and the effect upon markets was good rather than otherwise, as

                        and there is much wreckage yet to be dealt with. To day's telegrams on the
                        general trade conditions ruling in the United States are far from re
                        assoring, and all this will tend to keep people anxious as to the outcome
                        for some time yet. To-day being the 1st of November, the Stock Exchange is

                    <p>The market for gilt edged securities is now much firmer. Consols, which at

                    <p>The selling of Japanese bonds on American account continued for the greater
                        part of the week, and the list throughout showed daily declines. Yesterday,
                        however, the tone was better, and quotations rallied all-round. The second
                        series of 45 per cents. left off with an advance of at 89, and gains of tot

                        unchanged on the week. Home Rails. </p>
                    <p>The most significant feature of yesterday's rally on the Stock Exchange was
                        the spurt in home railway shares. This market, atter being in the depths of
                        depression for weeks, suddenly developed quite a buoyant tone, and prices
                        advanced all-round. London and North Western closed no less than 3 points
                        higher at 135, while there were was a gain of 2in the case of Great Norther.
                        Midland Deferred and Brighton "A" were up 2, Great Western 17. Chatham. and

                        Deferred 17, and Great Eastern 1. </p>
                    <p>This firmness of home railway shares is doubtless attributable to the
                        brighter outlook for an amicable settlement of the dispute be tween the
                        companies and the Amalgamated Society, as the result of the efforts of Mr.
                        Lloyd-George. The President of the Board of Trade had a further conference
                        with the railway directors yesterday morning, which was adjourned till later
                        in the day, and it was afterwards reported that a conciliation board might
                        be formed. The result of the men's ballot will be declared on Sunday at a
                        mass meeting to be held at the Albert Hall, and until then nothing can be
                        known as to this. The general opinion is, however, that the probabilities of
                        a strike are now remote. Americans. </p>
                    <p>In the early part of the week the American section was affected by the
                        disturbed condition of Wall Street, but yesterday the advices from the other
                        side were more favourable, and the tone was much firmer for the greater part
                        of the day. To an extent this advance was due to bear closing, but the most
                        helpful feature was the receipt of a substantial quantity of good
                        investmentorders from New York. The lead was taken by Union Pacific, there
                        being considerable dealings in these shares. The price opened about 114, and
                        before the close had advanced to 117, a gain of eight dollars on balance.
                        Southern Pacific advanced 44 to 71, Aitchison and Milwaukee 34 to 797 and
                        1073, Great Northern 3 to 116, and Baltimore and Ohio 27, to 839. Egyptians. </p>
                    <p>During the past week prices in the Egyptian market have fallen away somewhat,
                        this being entirely accounted for by the trouble in America and the dearer
                        money conditions now prevailing. The undertone is good, and it is generally
                        recognised that everything points to the future prosperity of Egypt.
                        Business has been on a small scale throughout the week. National Bank closed
                        practically at the lowest last night, being offered at 21, and Agricultural
                        Bank closed weak at 88. The Preference keep steady at 91, and the 31%
                        Debentures at 82-4, but buyers of this latter stock are very shy at present.

                    <p>The mining market shared in the general recovery, after being dull and
                        neglected. In the leading Kaffir descriptions there were gains up to Rand

                        gave way somewhat later in the day. Premier Deferred, however, advanced 1 to

                    <p>Mach interest is being taken in the Egyptian mining section in the
                        reconstruction scheme of the Egyptian Mines Exploration Company. It is
                        proposed that a new company be formed to be called the Egyptian Mines
                        Development Company, Ltd, with a capital of £60,000 divided into 240,000
                        shares of 67-. each. </p>
                    <p>Of these, 215,000 shares will be issued to present shareholders share for
                        share, credited with 1/-s. per share paid, and a bability of 4's. per sbare.
                        The directors add that of all the shares are taken up a sum of £48,000 will
                        be raised, which, with strict economy, should bring the mines into a
                        developed state, and it should then be more easy to provide the necessary
                        funds for the larger, and, doubtless. more economical method of working." </p>
                    <p>The announcement of the reconstruction has had no effect upon the shares of

                        Troubles. Indigestion. </p>
                    <p>Both oured by DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS. </p>
                    <p>The sunshine of the home fades when mother, wife, or daughter falls ill. Yet
                        women's ailments are invariably traceable to poverty of blood and nervous
                        disturbances. Therein lier the special value to women of Dr. Williams Pink
                        Pills for Pale People ; they cleanse and enrich bad blood, steady the nerves
                        and keep women strong and always well. Two cures in one home by Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills are recorded by Mrs. Hutchinson and Miss L Hutchinson,
                        of 7, John-street, Newcastle-on Tyne. </p>
                    <p>THE MOTHER'S STATEMENT. "Three years ago I felt run-down," said Mrs.
                        Hutchinson, "my limbs grew very weak, and splitting headaches seized me.
                        Pains in my back and shoulders rendered me helpless. 1 would often stagger
                        as I walked across the room. My sight became blurred and my tongue coated.
                        My liver grew disordered, and all food became distasteful. </p>
                    <p>"I could not sleep at night for palpitations of the heart seized me, and all
                        day I felt tired, languid, and listless. I made the mistake of taking common
                        medicines, instead of realising that the only cure possible was to enrich my
                        blood. </p>
                    <p>"A friend who had derived great benefit from Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
                        Pale People, persuaded me to begin a course of that medi cine. I did, and
                        after taking only a few boxes I was a changed woman. My blood became rich,
                        my sallow appearance gave way to a healty colour, I enjoyed my food and
                        refreshing sleep and was completely restored to health when I had used six
                        boxes of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills." </p>
                    <p>HER DAUGHTER Also. Just when my daughter Lizzie reached the anxious age of
                        young womanhood she became anæmie. Her face grew pale and she was no longer
                        bright and cheerful, but became listless and languid. She cansed me no
                        little anxiety until I administered Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. In three weeks
                        a remarkable change for the better came over her. She had complained of
                        indigestion also, but all traces of this and anæmia left her, and her veins
                        were filled with rich, red blood by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.". </p>
