                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM AND THE TEMPLES</head>
                    <p>The decision of the Government to raise the Assouan Dam has again brought
                        forward the question of the possible damage that will ensue to Philae and
                        the Nubian Temples, and a correspondence on this subject is. appearing in
                        the T'imes. In to day's issue we reproduce a letter from Sir William Preece
                        in reply to a letter : which we printed yesterday wherein.a parallel is
                        drawn between the intentions of Sir William Garstin and the
                        Anglo-Egyptianirrigation experts in this. matter and those of Torquemada,
                        Robespierre, and the Communards, and the writer goes on to state that "until
                        the ealet engineer has publicly proved that no lternatiye to his plans is
                        possible, and that he'is not merely oheapening: by destruction, he must be
                        classed as a public dauger."</p>
                    <p>On reading the furious outpourings of F. R. S." many will perhaps be reminded
                        of he famous invective of Ruskin's, "You have lespised Nature , that ih to
                        say, all the deep nd sacred sensations of natufal soenery. The 'rench.
                        revolutionista made stables of the athedrals of., Franoe; yon have made
                        raceourses of the cathedrals of the earth. Your ne conoeption of pleasure is
                        to drive in rail-road carriagesround their aisles and eat-off their altars.
                        You have pat a railrond bridge over the fall of Schaffhausen. You, have
                        .tun. nelled the oliffs of Lucerne by Tell's chapel ; yon have destroyed the
                        Clarens shore of the Take of Geneva; there is nota quiet vallex in England
                        that you haye not filled with bellowing fire ; there is no particle left of
                        English land which you have not trampled coal-ashes intonor any foreign city
                        in which the spread of your presence is not marked among ita fair old
                        streets and happy gardens by a consuming white leprosy of new hotels and
                        perfumers' shops; the.Alps themselves,which yourown poeta used to love so
                        reverently, you. look upon as soaped poles in a bear garden which yon set
                        yourselves to climb, and slide down again, with 'shrieks of delight. When
                        you are past shriek. ing, having no human articulate voice to say you are
                        glad with, you nll. the quietude. ot their valleys with gunpowder blasts,
                        and rush home red with cutaneous: eruption of conceit, and voluble with
                        convulsive hiccough of selfsatisfaction. , . It is pitiful to have dim
                        conceptions of duty ;. more pitiful, it seems to me; to have conceptions
                        like these, of thirth." </p>
                    <p>That is one aspect of the matter, It is, no doubt, exaggerated, rhetorical,'
                        sentimental almost to the verge of the grotesone. But it ex presses, as
                        none, perhaps, but Ruskin conld, that melancholy antinomy, so distrossing to
                        the r sentimentalist, which sete the slaims ofart and of Nature, of."all the
                        deep ard.sacred sensations of natural scenery," orer against the. claims of
                        human industry and ot buman pro gress. We do not beg the question i speaking
                        of human progress. We merely take note afthe fact that the world does move
                        from generatin to generation, and that, whether we like it or not, we'must
                        move with it. We'must live in our own age, not in any other ; and. Ruskin'
                        himself, if he had but known it, was as much a creature of his age as the
                        builders of the As. souan Dam. He could not have felt' and interpreted as he
                        did "all the deep and' sacred sensations of natural scenery," had he. lved
                        in the middle of. the eighteenth century ; still less, had he lived in his
                        own beloved Middle Ages. These are sensations which have grown with the
                        march of human progress. The quiet valleys whiose desecration he deplores
                        were left in their quietnde, not because they were prized for their beauty
                        by the generations of the past, but because there were few to enjoy, and
                        none to destroy, their ancient and undisturbed peace. It is only in this

                        last night at 9.30 o'clock. Dr. Kupper, vice president of the Cairo
                        Committee of the Associated Pharmacists, was in the chair, supported by the
                        hon. secre- 'tary,.Mr. Dirlik,. and Messrs. A. Mandofia, Montini, and
                        Dinkler. </p>

                        had led to the meeting being called. He then read a telegram from Mr.

                        the Cairo branch of the. Association a full and satisfactory meeting, and
                        hoping for a speedy, decision. </p>
                    <p>The hon. secretary then read the correspond- ence exchanged between the
                        committee and Sir Horace Pinching, of which he gave the substance. On
                        hearing that regulations were being drawn up by the Sanitary Department with
                        reference to the management. of pharma- cies,' the committee wrote to the
                        Director- General asking him to favour them with a draft copy of these
                        regulations before sending them to the Mixed Court of Appeal. The
                        Director-General replied expressing hiscomplete readiness to do so .. But
                        here, unfortunately, the matter ended. The. draft copy was not forwarded.
                        The draft . regulations were sent to.the Court of Appeal, and the law, as
                        it.now stands, was finally publistred. Many of the Cairo committee were
                        absent at the time of its publi- cation, which.aroused considerable
                        discussion in Alexandria, where a general, meeting was organised. The Cairo
                        committee wrote to the Alexandria committee on the subject and promised to
                        hold a general meeting as soon aa possible. The Alexandria committee replied
                        mentioning their intention of calling a. genieral meeting and of forwarding
                        a letter of protest against the regulations to the Sanitary Depart ment. The
                        Cairo committee then replied, suggesting that, to have due weight, thef
                        letter shouldbear the .wignatures of both committees. This letter, however,
                        arrived at Alexandria top late, whereon the Cairo com- mittee wired
                        regretting the isolated action of the Alexandria: committee and followed
                        their wire: by a letter stating their intention, of sending delegates to ask
                        for an interview with Sir H. Pinching and to beg for a delay of one. month
                        in the apphication of the law. The Director General expressed his
                        readiness-to meet the delegates. At the meeting he declared himself ready to
                        safeguard the interests and to meet the wishes of the Cairo pharmacists as
                        far as was possible, and informed them that he .proposed to suspend the
                        operation of thelaw till the end of the year The hon. secretary testified to
                        the kindness and con- ciliatory spirit shown by the Director-General during
                        the interview, which lasted for an hour. The Cairo committee then inferined
                        the Alex: andria committee of the rosnit of the inter- view and expressed a
                        hope that no isolated. action would be attempted and thiat the two
                        committees wogld stady with the utmost care' a matter that was of such
                        importance to the profession as a whole. </p>
                    <p>The hon secretary then informod the meeting that they had now to select- a
                        commnission of six members at whose deliberations Mr. Dinkler would be
                        present without a-vote, ds representing the Sanitary Department. Ho (the
                        hon. seoretary). assured them that the holders of diplomas and genuine
                        pharmacists ran no risks from the regulations. Their severity was aimed,
                        according to the Director-General, against the charlatan, who infested the
                        pro- fession in Egypt, and the capitalists, who were not pharmacists but put
                        pharmacies in the charge of unqualified men. As for the election of a
                        commission, it had been suggested that each nation should be represented.
                        With thia he totally disagreed. Six experienced phar- macists were required. </p>
                    <p>A little discussion followed, after which the chairman and the hon. secretary
                        stated that the commission should draw. up a report on the regulations and
                        submit the same to be discussed at a general mee ing. .It was then decided

                        this town is filling.a hitherto much-needed want. It, differs from the
                        Government hospitals inssmuch as the patients onri be Trented by their own
                        doctors, if they so wish iv. But in the. Govern- ment hospitals the doctors
                        attached to the hospital are the. only ones .who can attend the patients.
                        Dr. and Mrs. Askern, of the American: Mission, are -in. charge, of the
                        hospital, and their management ldaves nothing to be desired,</p>

                    <p>Reports have been for some time current that this province is the scene
                        of.unusual disturbance and bloodshed. We are assured by a highly competent
                        authority that there is nothing unusual in its condition. It remains, as
                        ever, the theatre of every species of confliet, inter-tribal battles,
                        rebellions against the central authority, highway robbery, and private
                        feuds; but there is no reason to believe, that any of the parties concerned
                        are displaying more than their usual activity. </p>

                    <p>Several of our contemporaries have recently. published a statement to the
                        effect that a band of brigands infested the caravan ronte between Kantara
                        and -El Arish, and not content with robbing travellers, had repulsed a Ccast
                        Guard patrol which attempted to arrest them by a heavy and well-directed
                        fire. </p>
                    <p>On enquiry at the Ministry of the Interior we find that on August 2 and
                        August 16 certain Bedouin tribesmen stole a few camels which were the
                        property of another tribe, or another section of their tribe. A council .of
                        sheikhs and elders was called to enquire into the matter, No lives were
                        lost, no caravans attacked,andno Coast Guards repulsed. Hadany real
                        encounter taken place we should doubt- less have heard most astonishing
                        stories of slaughter and revolt.</p>

                    <p>In her annual report on the Ministering Children's League, the Countess :of
                        .Meath says :- + </p>
                    <p>Out work thr the blind in .Rgypt .continues to be most encouraging. The
                        M.C.L. Industrial School in Alexandria, is being suocensfully carried on
                        under the management of'sn efficient local committee. : Last year, when I.
                        visited Egypt, it was a pleasure to find that A whole honse, instead of a
                        few rooms, had been rented for the purpose of giving instruction to
                        sightless men and boys, The house proved most usefal: for. the ,wndertaking,
                        and it was felt desirable to seoure it for a permanenay. During my visit to
                        Alexandris this spring overtures were made to the landlord with a view to
                        buying the house, but he would not come to terms with the committee. Mr.
                        Alderson, the owner of a great deal of land in the city, was next
                        approached, and, in the most generous manner possible, he kindly presented
                        us with a piece of land in a central position in . Alexandria, as he, as s
                        practical business man, highly approved of the exoellent work (securing
                        ready purchase). done by the blind. This gift of land is the more gratifying
                        as the valve of. house property is rising very rapidly-in Alexandria, and
                        prohibitive prioes are being asked for it. The site for the school presented
                        .by Mr. Alderson was added to by another donor, but that, contributed by the
                        former alone is worth £900, and; besides this, he most generously gave a
                        handsome donation towards the building fund. Nor is this all, for Mr.
                        Alderson took nearly the whole charge and. expense of making arrangements
                        for the ceremony. of laying the foundation stone of the new. building, and
                        he is now superintending the erection of this new institution. Mr.
                        Alderson's gift to our League. is a most valu- able ong, and, as far.as
                        I'know, it is the largest we have ever received from any person not
                        connected with the soeiety. I trust that, as an association, we are not
                        ungrateful to our bene- factors, and I feel' sure that we shall wish by-
                        and-bye to express our gratitude for so generous a gift by passing an
                        unanimous vote of thanka to Mr. Alderson.</p>

                        dealt with in the October number of, the Pall . Mall Magazine. in a
                        symposium, to which wations- eminent hands contribute. Let us quote from

                        great painters and. creative musicians. .A deep experience of the world and

                        is quite certain that there can be no vital drawing of modern English life
                        while it remains the fashion in this country to describe women as they never
                        were, and men as they cannot be. Thac- keray in his day uttered the same
                        complaint. He dared pot speak out, and he handed on the jarketable false
                        sentiment with such sin- cerity in his satire that he was never 'populer.'
                        The least intelligent reader always. felt that Thackeray knew him through
                        and through. Pretty passages were all very' well, bnt the truth pierced them

                    <head>NOTES UPON GREEK AND LATIN PAPYRI</head>
                    <p>In the second volmye giving specimens of papyri in the possession of Lord
                        Amherst, there are two fragmnents of elassic anthors which merit notice. One
                        of them, which unfortunately only contains-15 legible lines, gives part of a
                        tragedy. Thie scene of which they are descrip- tive eyidently took place at
                        Troy during the celebrated siege. The speakers are certainly Hector and
                        Polydamas. The passage preserved does- not. offer to literature any
                        specially poetic expression, con- sequently our chief practical interest in
                        it will afise from ascertainiug, if . possible, of which poet's werk it
                        affords an example, We can hardly err. if with Weil and Radermacher we
                        assign it to the lost tragedy of "Hector" by. Astydainas, who, we are told
                        by Pfutarch, by this play gained a victory famous in the dra- tnatic annals
                        of Athens. The other fragment presents only five lines that can be
                        satisfactorily completed ; but they tell us sufficient to detect it to be a
                        passage from the argument of the "Skiron" of Euripides,. because one of
                        these lines. is quoted as being from that work in the. "Florilegeum" of
                        Stobeaus. The collection of papyri at Strasburg -pos- sesses part of a
                        prologue to a Greek comedy, that has been edited by . Kaibel and Reitzen-
                        stein, which indicates a most interesting story, but no scholar has hitherto
                        been able to divine the name of the work, or its author. .After a fey badly
                        preserved sentences, uttered by some deity, the prologue proceeds. to tell
                        us that once upon a time two twin brothers, Sosthenes and Detnea, married
                        two twin sisters, who bore to one.a son, to the other a daughter. The
                        brothers for some reason went to Asia and there encountered great dangers
                        and advent- ures, one was imprisoned and assisted to escape by the other,
                        who in his turn was incarcerated for aiding the first to get away. They
                        remain; ed absent 16 years ; doubtless the liberated one declining to go
                        home until he in turn could rescue his brother. Though wethave no more of
                        the epitome of the comedy it is very .easy to foresee that during the 16
                        years the boy and girl have grown up and douhtless become enamoured of each
                        other, and probably are in some difficulty which only the return of. their
                        respective parents will solve. No title of any recorded play, or suminary of
                        the plot of a lost comedy, appears to apply to this fragment. It is to be
                        hoped that one or more of the lines we now possess may be found quoted by
                        some scholiast, or. lexicographer, with a note as to their author. One of
                        the longest of the newly recovered portions of poems by an unknown author
                        found in Egypt is the fragment of an Epic of Ninos published by Herr Wilcken
                        and M. Weil. It relates to Ninos, the celebrated builder of Nineveh, hia
                        mother, whose name is herein given us as Thambe, his aunt Derkeia, and her
                        daughter, whose name does not transpire from the fragment, but undoubtedly
                        was Semiramis, because Derkeia er Derke was stated by classic writers,
                        previously known,. to have been her mother's nane. The portion of the poem
                        we now forfunately can peruse commences with a conversation, between Ninos
                        and. Derkeia, in which he craves the lady's'permission to espouse her
                        daughter. Claining that his age, of 17, is that. preferable for marriage,
                        and also that her own was also just suitable, (though he politely does not
                        give. hers it appears from.his arguments to have been 14), he urges his
                        suit. The intended mother-in law. desired the nuptials. to. be postponed for
                        two years, but Ninos points out. that he may be slain in warfare and should
                        prepare an heir, for as both the young people were only offspring, otherwise
                        the direct royal line would lapse. The second part of the text contains the
                        arguments. of the young lady. to her aunt Thambe. These are not so much of
                        an oratorical order'as to be convincing, but her tears and- sighs appear to
                        have gained her cause. :The two aunts enter into conversation as to obtain-
                        ing the king's permission. The narrative is then broken off by a mutilation
                        of the papyrus and.when it recommences we find the young people united, and
                        Ninos proceeding to some war, and an account of the campaign in a
                        mountainous country follows. The combats are' in Armenia, and Ninos is
                        asdisted by Greek and Carian mercenaries. The army is accom- parried by a
                        hundred, or more, elephants. This fragment of the text terminates with A
                        description of the line of battle srranged by Ninos. Itis plain that the
                        plot, or interest, of the story centred in the enforced separation of the
                        newly-matried prince and princess, especially the proloriged "campaign of
                        Ninos. Com- pensatory comfort must have been derived by the bride arising
                        from the evidence afforded, by the test of war, of the military genius of
                        Ninos. It is indeed wonderful, resembling thecelebrated exploits of-Cyrus in
                        the "Cyropedia." Generally in these stories the ancient novelists, or quasi
                        historians, separated the loveri by some violent peril, or abduction, but
                        here the cause appears to have .been merely the warrior duty of a martial
                        prince and to have been .virtually voluntary. Dr. Carl Sehmidt has at length
                        completely published all the Coptic version of the Apo- chryphal "Acts of
                        Panl" which was acquired. by the Heidelburg Library in Egypt some years ago.
                        The text he has -been enabled to print presents some 2,600 verses; which
                        must be about three-fourths of the whole work because the stichometrical
                        analysis of early .Christian books preserved in the Codex Claromontanus
                        tells us it possessed a total of 3,560 verses. The new Coptic text, however,
                        does not afford us so much fresh matter because it appears that "the
                        complete ."Acte of Paul" inoluded three works already known, and extant.
                        These. are the "Acts of Paul and Thecla," the short tract entitled."The
                        Martyrum Pauli," and the "Correspondence of Paul with the Corinthians."
                        Moreover, the book appears to have little historical value. The parts that
                        are novel relate to alleged occurrences at Antioch, Myra. Sidon, Tyre,
                        Philippi, and Rome. The events at the latter Metropolis concern the persecu-
                        tion under Nero, and it is an interesting fact to be noted by ecctesiastical
                        scholars that there is no mention of the presence of the Apostle Peter at
                        Rome, in the Coptic, but the text,is in a very fragmentary condition. About
                        the same date . Mrs. Agnes Smith Lewis has published the work found by her
                        in a convent in the Nitrian desert a, few years ago : "The Mythological Acts
                        of the Apostles." They are of a decidedly apochryphal character, and useless
                        for historical purposes. A curious incident relates to the burial of aryoung
                        girl in the foundation of a bathhouse that was being erected. This cruel
                        form' of propitiating the earth demon will be familiar to the students of
                        the early history of mankind, and may be found fully.referred to in M.

                        <head>REDUCTION OF GARRISON</head>
                        <p>Sir,-The excellent leading article in yester- day's issue, and the action
                            of the Alexandria branch of the British Chamber of Commerce in Egyptin
                            declining to join that of Cairo in protesting against the reduction of
                            the British Garrison, will effectually scotch the ridiculous agitation
                            against the reduction. Anything more sense- less and ill-timed it is
                            impossible to imagine. If there had been any real prospective danger one
                            would have expected the . other foreign "colonies" to have taken the
                            matter up by holding public meetings and making, repre- sentations to
                            their respective consuls ; but aa far as is known no action has been
                            taken or is contemplated in this direction. Take the Greek for
                            instance-the 'largest of the colonies. Are not their lives and property
                            as dear to the Greek community as ours are to us, and are they not as
                            capable as we are of gauging unto- ward eventualities-they who have
                            settled in this country for centuries longer-than we have and, by reason
                            of their closer connection with the native population, possess, one
                            would think, far better opportunities than. we do of estimating the
                            possibilities of civil commotion which may follow upon the step about to
                            be taken ? And yet they show not the remotest sign of apprehonsion
                            whatsoever. Is it not then astounding that the .complaint should
                            originate with the Britishers alone ? I cannot but think that the .
                            movement-if it deserves to be dignitied by such a name-is confined to a
                            small and uninfluential section of our community-perliaps even to. a

                            inst. relative to the above subject. You will remember that the
                            Anglo-French Agreement was submitted to and sanctioned by the British
                            Parliament. I was not in the House at the time, but from the reports I
                            read I have a distinct recollection that it was stated from the Treasury
                            Bench that the Agreement awaited. ratification by the French Chambers.
                            I'am quite unable to say whether such a course is essential or optional
                            according to the French Parliamentary Law, but, unless my memory has

                            has, to say the least of it, a suspicious method of apologizing for its
                            delinquencies ; for mark how he meets my complaints. It is, forsooth,
                            not the authori- ties but I who am at fault. It is I who stand convicted
                            upon my own confession of the serious offence of inspecting the Go-
                            vernment stores.It is I, likewise, who am guilty of the still more
                            heinous crime of bribing an official with two piastres to give me a

                            alleges were part and parcel of such Government stores as aforesaid.

                        time (it was establislied 8 years ago), has conquered the world. As in Egypt
                        the number of customers of the Royal Hungarian Lottery is very large, this
                        General-Agency ("Bank El Nhssib") was. established in this town at Rue
                        Tewfik No. 12, to afford those interasted in this country every fncility and
                        'ease in the purchase of tickets without any delay, to assure them of the
                        emphatie maintenance of their interesta in every way, and further,/to pay
                        the, winnings promptly. All those who are already in connexion with this
                        Royal Hungarian Dottery but want any explanations, or those who wish to
                        purchase tickets, may direct their enquiries to the General Agency "El
                        Nassib" in Alexandria, No. 12, Rue Tewfik, verbally or by letter. All
                        requeeta will. be settled promptly and without any fee. There are issned
                        110,000 tickets, of which 55,000, that js the half, must win undoubted- ly
                        .. These 55,000 tickets naturally cannot be drawu in one single drawing.
                        Therefore, and for reasons which are indicated later, each Lottery is
                        divided into 6 parts, named classes,whose drawings take place at intervals
                        of 8-4 weeks. The big prizes of these 6 classes are as. follows :. Ist Class
                        Crówns 60,000; -- 2nd .3rd 4th 5th 6th 200,000, 100,000, 80,000, 60,000,
                        50,000, etc.,etc. One crown equals frs. 1.05 .- Withonesingleticket it is
                        possible.to win One Million Crowns, as according to the destina- tions of
                        the Official Prospectus the premium of crowns 600,000, will go . to that
                        number which draws the last prize between 400,000 and 2,000crowns. If this
                        prize drawn at last the prize of drowns 400,000, so the fortunate possessor
                        of this ticket will become millionaire. By the following copy of the balance
                        of the Official. Prospectus it will be seon that the total receipta are to

                        cost of organization, managoment and control, there will be deducted 20% of
                        the value of the winnings, aocording to the Official Prospectus. .. The
                        smallest gain in the 6th olass covers the total of the stakes of all the 6
                        classes, for the smallest prize in the 6th olass is Crowns 200 ; deduet 20%
                        and there. remains crowns 160. The player only winning such a small prize
                        recovers his whole disbursement. Really, the most important loss could only
                        be crowns 160,, or frs. 168, paid for a whole ticket. On the other hand, the
                        fortunate winner may be happy all his life, because there is a' large number
                        of. very considerabie prizes. The price.of the tickets for all the 6 alasses
                        of one Lottery is fixed by the board of govern- ment at crowns 160, or. frs.
                        168. The General Agency, "El Nassib," sells the ticketa at this price
                        without any extra charge. The system of classes was also ohosen on the
                        supposition that a number of partakers would not like to pay the amount' of
                        frs. 168 all at onoe. Thererore the Lottery waa divided into classes, so
                        that it is pomeible to pay the atakee proportionally to the olases. The
                        stakes for each class are for one whole ticket :- Ist.class Crowns 12: or

                        amount. The sums to be won with such a participation are already big enough,
                        becaure the Lottery's winnings are extrsordinarily high. The tickets are
                        numbered from 1 to 110,000 and the |, f and i have for distinetion, the

                        legislative pabulum .for the most hungry of parlismentarians to absorb. But
                        everybody must see that-even. without reckoning with the chapter of
                        sccidents-the strongest Govern- ment in the world might well come to grief
                        over one or another of the subjects just enumerated .. Now, although the
                        "Bloc". is- still apparently, solid enough, not s few of its members are
                        said to be just a little tired of M. Combes, and would. like to see somebody
                        else in his place. , M. Combes, however, is not an easy man to get rid of,
                        as he has proved by this.time. I should not be surprised if he held his own

                    <p>M. Waldeck-Roussean is, unfortunately for his-country, no more; nevertheless,
                        defunctus adhuc loquitur. His posthumous papers prove, beyond question, that
                        he never intended the Associations law to be used for the purpose of
                        destroying the Religious Oyders in France, but to regularise their position
                        by subjeeting them to State control. In s country: where government is
                        nothing if not highly centralised, and. where the State' aims at being, and
                        thostly is, omnipotent in practice as well as in theory, that was a
                        legitimate object. Unfortunately, the author of the measure was ahtisfied
                        with having formulated. his policy, and left it to another to carry out. In
                        so doing he committed a grave impradence. His stccessor, as the event has
                        shown, was not the man for the job. Whether M. Combes really meanit to
                        administer the law honestly, in the ight of these papers. The late Premier

                    <p>A pathetic scene was witnessed a few days go on the platform of. the
                        Abbeville station. A number of, nuns, who had devoted their ives to the
                        education of the young girls in-the own; had been expelled from their
                        convent, nd journeyed to the statiog en route for their lace of exile.The
                        one who attracted most ttention was Sister Saint Jean Baptiste, the perior
                        of the convent, who is over eighty ears of age. When theaged lady saw the
                        train nd the locomotiye, she burstinto tears. She had entered theconventof
                        Abbeville in 1845; andhad hever left it until she was compelled to do so;
                        onsequently she was completely ignorant of what w. railway was like. Her
                        |first railway jourey was to a place of exile. </p>
                    <p>An incident at Brest reveals the extraordin -. ary state of things prevajling
                        in the French arsenals. A week ago some clerks and work- men employed in the
                        dockyard made use, at a public meeting, of insulting expressions towards
                        their own'officers. Che of the orstors declated that the officers of the
                        French fleet were only good for running shipe asbore. Vice-Admiral Mallarme,
                        commanding the port, invited the officials of the men's union to wait upon
                        him with a view to an explanation and retractation of this language.
                        Confronted with the Admiral, the speakers. absolutely refused to withdraw
                        any one of their expressions, . which were as insulting against the
                        Government as against the etat-major of the deckyard. The position,
                        therefore, is this :- Government servants in Government pay taaduce their
                        own superiors and insist on their right te criticise as private citizens.
                        The piqaaney of the situation is added to by a despatch which M. Pelletan is
                        said. to have sent to the Admiral, calling the attention of the workmen to
                        their duties towards the Administration. The Minister,is, perhaps, not
                        unmindful of the fact that Parliament has reassembled on Tuesday and that
                        some account may be required of his stewardship. </p>

                        foreign competition has mnade the Paris "cou- turier" very shy of exposing
                        his secrets before their time. It requires a workl of ingennity, nowadays,
                        to obtain an inkling of the coming mode. The greatest sinners in . pirating
                        the Paris fashions are Germany and America. But in comparison with Berlin,

                        figure in the German capital. The dress is a Paris dress in all essentials,
                        and skilled workers can be found on the banks of the Spree as they. tan on
                        the banks of the. Seine: Who can resist such competition ? Even some
                        Parisiennes, who pique themselves on their perfect taste, are not immine
                        from such temptation. Thus dresses . designed in Paris but made in Germany
                        are to berfound on the backs of fair inhabitants of .the "ville. lumiere."
                        It is all very well to sppeal to- patriotism, but the argument of the purse
                        is stronger than any. </p>

                        style. Let the creator be. removed to London or New York, and she quickly

                        unoonimonly, the renumeration of these gifted creatures. A foreign or
                        provincial lady enters. the salon of a great dressmaker with. much the
                        feelings of a patient consulting a spe- cinlist. She is certain that all is
                        not right with her, but she cannot define her complaint. With the eye of a
                        great artist the creator of the fashions sums up her "pointe." "Madame
                        wishes a robe for an evening reception or k marringe 1' ."Very well."
                        Instantly the pencil goes to work, and in the space of five minutes there is

                        but she has, the tact of a diplo- mat as well as the grace and carriage of a
                        uchess. Under colour of giving hints on dress, he conveys little lessons in
                        deportment; but it is so delicately done, that there is none to take

                        nothing of the sort, but it is a delicate way of saying the "cliente" has
                        not quite got the art of holding her dress. "The dress would be better if

                        shown in the case of the Mediterranean .. A recent brochure presented to.the
                        French Academy of Sciences furnishes interesting information on this point;
                        it being apparent that the sea has greatly in- crensed in depta as compared
                        to ancient times. Forinerly a bridge 3,000 feet long, united Leucade to the

                        embroiderers to the youngest of thre,midinettes, to Fontaineblean. The
                        excursion was arranged by a special agency, and Ali Kadont was sebt with the
                        party as guide and general, caretaker. The Arab received as much as £120 for

                        successful at the outset. The:dressmaker and her girls, old and young, were
                        enchanted, and sat down to dinner in one of the best hotels in
                        Fontaineblean, with splendid appetites. Then all, went to the train for .
                        Paris, and at. a late hour the Gare de Lyon was reach- ed. At this terminus
                        the dressmaker called the roll of her handi, and.it was found that one of
                        the youngest and prettiest of the midinettes had disappeared. So, too had

                        that the man had been paying special attention during the excursion to the
                        midinette who had vanished. As Ali Kadour had taken . not only the girl, but
                        had also gone away: with the surplus money which he had to return, the
