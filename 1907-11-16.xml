                    <head>THE MONEY CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>"When we read the reports of the financial situation in America, we are
                        reminded of the picturesque account which Lord Cromer gave as the other day
                        of the habits of the people of Egypt," says the "Westminster Gazette" Nov.
                        5). "These people, it seems, have so little faith in banks and credit
                        institutions that they cannot be induced to part with their gold when they
                        have once got it into their possession. A vast deal of money. goes into
                        Egypt which never comes out in; how mach, we may judge from the fact that
                        during the last four years the imports: of gold have been thirteen millions
                        more than the exports.</p>
                    <p>"What becomes of this vast quantity of coin ! A great deal, Lord Cramer tells
                        us, is manufactured into jewelry. It is estimated that last year between one
                        and half and two millions was disposed of in this way alone. The rest is
                        hoarded. Lord Cromer tells us that a little while ago he heard of an
                        Egyptian gentleman who died leaving a fortune of £80,000, the whole of which
                        was found in his cellars. Then, again, he heard of a substantial yeoman who
                        bought a property for £25,000. Half an hoar after the contract was signed he
                        appeared with a train of donkeys bearing on their backs the money, which bad
                        been buried in his garden.</p>
                    <p>"The European is at first tempted to cry out at the extreme folly of these
                        simple people who deprive themselves of income in order to secure their
                        capital. But he too, perhaps, when he considers the dismal tale of the stock
                        and share lists and counts up his capital losses on money securely invested
                        in high-class securities, say, four years ago, may say to himself on further
                        reflection that these people have after all not proved so very foolish. -
                        'The argument is not to be pressed too far, or prudent husbands and fathers
                        of families may find them selves beset by wives and daughters imploring
                        them, in the name of thrift, the convert their surplus gold into articles of
                        stable value which adorn the person instead of throwing it down the gulf of
                        depreciating securities.</p>
                    <p>"But it isa very thin line which divides the civilised man from the
                        primitive, and the present mood of the American man is to stick to his gold
                        and keep it in cellars and back gardens, now that he has happily rescued it
                        from the banks and the millionaires. Hence the extreme disorganization of
                        the currency in America, and the frantic pull on the limited supply of
                        European gold which compelled the Directors of the Bank of England yesterday
                        (Nov. 4) to protect their position by raising the Bank rate to 6 per cent.,
                        with, possibly, a further rise to follow.</p>
                    <p>"The fact faces us that no possible accumulation of gold could avail us in
                        presence ot anything like a general breakdown of the the credit system.
                        Modern industry and commerce refuse to be controlled by the output of the
                        gold mines of the world, however much it may be influenced by the
                        fluctuations in prices which follow from a shortage or excess of the gold
                        supply.</p>
                    <p>"The panic in America, which has sent people running to the banks for their
                        gold, is due simply to the fact that depositors have lost faith in the
                        honesty or discretion (or both) of certain men and groups of men who are
                        temporarily masters of their credit. At this point the remedies are twofold.
                        There is, first, the temporary remedy to be applied by the Government and
                        the leading financiers in concert to restore cash payment or payment in
                        notes, which are the equivalent of cash; and there is, secondly, the
                        permanent remedy, in which also the Government must take a hand, of saving
                        the public and the industry of the country from the wild gambling and
                        dishonest dealing which, if it continued, would rot the whole fabric of
                        trade and credit.</p>
                    <p>"President Roosevelt is trying to apply both remedies simultaneously. Trade
                        and industry in America, like industry a few years ago in South Africa, are
                        temporarily on a basis of unreal speculative values, which must gradually be
                        brought down to hard fact, It will take time, and it will be accompanied by
                        temporary hardship to many people and interests, but the American people
                        have shown more than once that they are capable of conducting this operation
                        with great thoroughness, and we have much belief in their capacity to do if

                        <p>During the summer months there has been a continuous demand by seamen for

                    <byline>(From a CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <p>The Lilliputian troupe are not so good as their predecessors of last year,
                        but they are delightful nevertheless. So far I bave heard "Lucia di
                        Lammermoor" and the "Geisha". Lucia was characteristic, the children out-
                        Heroded Herod or rather, out Sara-d Sara. All the tragic gestures, glances,
                        intonations appeared, heightened by a delicate tonch' of exaggeration-they
                        were playing at being Lucia, Sir Edgardo, Lord Enrico Sir Edgardo was
                        especially pleasing ; he had a way of his own in discarding cloak and hat,
                        drawing or sheathing his sword. Lord Enrico was but little behind him. Their
                        self consciousnes was absorbing, + quite different from the fatuity of the
                        tenor, baritone, and soprano who think of their high notes, their phrasing,
                        the audience. These boys and girls probably thought of their nice clothes,
                        and the fun of acting a real tragedy on a real stage.</p>
                    <p>The ''Geisha" was charming as a whole, the ' music was taken in the Italian
                        style, drawn out, slower, heightening such effgets as it has, and the fan
                        was spontaneous and telling. The youth who represented Wung Hi is precocious
                        beyond his years and should make a comedian one day. The Geisha herself, and
                        Madame L'Interpréte are also older, and more formed, and can well be
                        compared with grown-up per- formers. Mimosa San's rendering of the Gold Fish
                        song was charming in itself and not merely for its environment.</p>
                    <p>As to these performances, qua performances, the individual singing of the
                        younger mem- bers is admirable, they know their parts, and have pretty
                        voices, well enough trained. The chorus is apt to go out of tune at moments.
                        The orchestra play far too loud as a rule, and are too hard on the voices.
                        It was the same, last time, when the director of the troupe was atthe piano,
                        he did not seem to allow for theage of his singers.</p>
                    <p>Mile Dora Theor who took Lucia, and the Geisha is in a sense a finished
                        singer — more 30 almost than Mile Lidia Levi of last year, but without the
                        same perfection of voice : Mile Lidia Levi bad a singularly beautiful voice,
                        acertain purity and appeal in that it attracted and held the attention, one
                        could not forget it.</p>
                    <p>At any rate, if Mile Lidia Levi, Mlle Theor is well worth hearing for her
                        singing alone. The rest are delightful because they have pleasant childrens'
                        voices, and their whole performance gives a distinct impression in contrast
                        to opera in general by trained opera singers, it is a novelty, and a most
                        charming novelty at that.</p>

                    <p>At a meeting of the master cotton-spinners held yesterday at Manchester, it

                    <head>THE CULTIVATION OF COTTON.</head>
                    <p>Herr Koffler, president of this year's Inter- national Cotton Congress at
                        Vienna, was interviewed at Manchester last week on his return from America.
                        He said the deputation of European spinners to the United States had been
                        impressed by the fact that the American cottonfields could be made to yield
                        much more than they yielded to-day. It was very important also that a
                        knowledge of various grades of cotton should be spread among American cotton
                        farmers who were unaware of the reasons why spinners pre- ferred one staple
                        over another. The method of growing and handling cotton could be very
                        greatly improved, and the spinners of Europe would have to give an
                        object-lesson by them- selves forming a company, buying a fair-sized
                        plantation in America, managing it on the best lines, and in this way
                        putting to the test the practical suggestions that have recently been made.
                        The American farmers, he said, were better organised than was thought, but
                        they could not yet command their members on the question of the prices to be
                        demanded for cotton or on the question of holding baek the eotton from the
                        market.</p>

                    <head>THE END OF RAMADAN.<lb/> CELEBRATION IN LONDON.</head>
                    <p>The end of the fast of Ramadan was cele- brated by Mohamedans in London at
                        the Hol- born Restaurant last Thursday week.</p>
                    <p>There was nothing in the surroundings to make the event impressive says the
                        '"I'ribune'". The service was held in a dark upper room of the Holborn
                        Restaurant. Servants were sweeping the approaches to the apartments, and the
                        lights were out. There was no instrumental music ; there were no ritualistic
                        appointments. Yet, in spite, of all this, the short service in a dining-room
                        appealed with powerful force to the imagination of those with even an
                        elementary knowledge of the religions of the world.</p>
                    <p>'There is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet !" And here, in the heart
                        of Christian London, half a hundred good Moslems assem- bled at the
                        appointed time, turned their faces to Mecca, and bowed the head in adoration
                        of Allah and his preacher.</p>
                    <p>An Imam was chosen for the occasion to say the "Id-ul-Fitr" prayer. He was
                        Mr. H. M. Shairini, the secretary of the Pan-Islamic Society. He took off
                        his boots and assumed his turban. In the same way all the worship- pers
                        removed their boots and assumed either fez or turban. A Mohamedan must cover
                        his head at prayer, and that covering must have no brim, otherwise the
                        genuflection to the ground would be impede. There were Moslems presént from
                        Turkey, Arabia, Egypt, India, Bormah, Afghanistan, and South Africa.</p>
                    <p>The Imam said his prayers, providing the welcome sign that the thirty days'
                        fast was over. The worshippers bowed their heads to the ground as he uttered
                        the phrases in praise of Allah and the Prophet. Late comers clat- tered in,
                        took off their boots, genuflected to- waids Mecca, and at once took their
                        part in the simple service. The congregation pros- trated itself to the
                        ground, rose to its feet, and then, tailor-fashion, sat on its heels to
                        listen to the exhortation. This was in praise lof the Sultan of Turkey as
                        Sheikh-ul-Islam, and his four caliphs, and again the adorationa were made.
                        :</p>
                    <p>When the short service was over the wor- shippers rose to their feet, clasped
                        each other in boisterous embraces, and at once filled the room with the
                        beatific smoke of cigarettes. For thirty days they had been' denied the
                        comforts of food, drink, and tobacco during the hours of alleged London
                        sunshine. Freed from this disability their first craving was for tobacco. It
                        is the same through all the world of Islam, as witness a story recently told
                        by adevout Moslem: "You should see my old father, who lives in
                        Constantinople. Five minutes before the sunset gun fires on Top- liané he
                        takes out his pouch and rolls a cigarette. Still engaged in contemplation of
                        Allah he holds the cigarette in one hand and a match in the other. Bang
                        goesthe gun, and at once the room is filled with clouds of smoke. Three
                        cigarettes smoked at steam-engine rate, and then my father goes to breakfast

                    <head>NATIVE OPINION.<lb/> MUDIRS AND INSPECTORS.</head>
                    <p>(From "At Watan")</p>
                    <p>It appears that the whole Egyptian Press is of one mind upon the question of
                        these youthful Inspectors entrusted by the Ministry of Interior with the
                        serious work of saperintending the work of its officials in the provinces.
                        The belief in their approaching doom is also aniversal as far as we can see,
                        but it is idle to deny that the prospect of strengthening the hands of our
                        Mudirs and Mamoors has been viewed with mingled feelings among the various
                        sections of the community. To the ordinary Effendi or Bey in Cairo and other
                        cities the projected change io the present order of things is equitable; the
                        native go- vernor ought to be respected and given some power in his sphere.
                        Bat to the fellah, of these provinces the change ie most undesirable and may
                        be considered as de- trimental to the interests of the lower clas- ses at
                        large. The fellah has tried the English Inspector and found him wanting in
                        experience and dourtesy, easy to misguide and everbearing to a degree ; but
                        the fellah has never been robbed of his property by an Inspector, nor
                        flogged, nor sent to prison without cause. The English Inspector was neither
                        brilliant or oblig- ing, but he was not cruel or anjast. As to the Madir or
                        Mamoor the experience of the fellah has shewn different results. The
                        ordinary Egyp- tian prefers anything to the absolute rule ofa native Mamoor.
                        He accuses him of injastice for personal motives and insists apon applying
                        for an inquiry into his case by an English Ins- pector whenever he falls
                        into trouble with a person of the official class. To remove the Ins- pector
                        altogether is, therefore, to abolish one of the main securities of justice
                        and good government in the country.</p>
                    <p>The question is, therefore, two sided. We approve the idea of giving more
                        authority to the governors but we have reasons to fear the consequences of
                        such &amp; reversion to an old and discredited system. We do not like the
                        present inspector with his supercilious manners and mischievous
                        inexperience, but we really want bim and do not feel at ease withoat him. In
                        other words the inspector is necessary but he ought to be of a different
                        type, passessing more tact and more experience than the young man of the
                        present regime. This being the case, we can find only one solution
                        acceptable to all parties by maintaining the post of inspec- tor but
                        appointing to it men to whom our Mudirs will submit with pleasure and who
                        can bring experience and prestige to help them in their work of inspection.
                        We need not have too many of them. Only one superior: official of this class
                        for Upper Egypt and one for Lower Egypt will inspire the people with
                        confidence and suffice to check the tendencies of erratic Mamoors. If we
                        were to name the persons best qualified in our opinion for such. high and
                        onerous duties we would mention Coles Pasha and Harvey Pasha to divide the
                        country be- tween them and put our internal affairs on a sound basis. Svch
                        an arrangement woald be acceptable to all parties and gratifying to the
                        nation at large. We call the attention of authorities to it and trast that
                        it will be given fall consideration.</p>

                    <p>Admiral Sir Charles Drury and Lady Drury gave a dinner last week, at Malta,
                        in honour of the Ottoman Consul-General and Mme. Azarian. Most of the
                        officers who were presented to 'the Sultan during the British fleet's recent
                        visit to Constantinople were present, in tull uniform, and wearing the
                        decorations be- stowed upon them by the Sultan. Lady Drary wore the Grand
                        Cordon of the Chefakat Order, and the Commander-in-Chief the Grand Cordon of
                        the Osmanieh. Sir Charles Drury, in pro- ff posing the toast of the Sultan,
                        referred to the brilliant reception accorded to himself and Lady Drury and
                        the British officers on the dccasion of their visit to Constantinople. At

                        The Turkish Consul-General, in reply, thanked the Admiral, and said that his
                        Sovereign greatly welcomed valorous men of all lands, and particularly those
                        belonging to the great British nation, to whom Turkey had been bound by a
                        friendship of a century's standing. Azarian Effendi, in conclusion, drank to

                        Lady Drury, and to the health snd prosperity of the British Navy.</p>

                    <head>A NEW DISCOVERY OF LOST CLASSIC LITERATURE IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Early in the year 411 B.C. the democratic constitution at Athens was and the
                        sovereignty of the people passed into the hands of a Council of Four
                        Hundred.</p>
                    <p>This "Coup d'Etat" was rendered possible by the political follies of the
                        demagoguee who had been unwisely elected by the populace, cul- minating in
                        the disastrous Sicilian expedition, being feebly sustained with insufficient
                        funds.</p>
                    <p>The Council of the Four Hundred did not however long remain in power, their
                        ignorance of administration and aflairs and the disor- ganised state of the
                        finances, and exhaustion of both 'army and navy made it impossible tor them
                        to improve the situation, and in a few months swept away and the de-
                        mocratic tution restored to the city.</p>
                    <p>One of the most marked members of the ved council was Antiphon who came Anh
                        and who had not originally adopt- Oratory and composed speeches and
                        pleadings For speakers and advocates. He came from his home at, apparently,
                        what he considered a crisis in the history of his state, entered heartily
                        into the plot which subjected the oligarchy of 400 for the larger democracy.
                        The former as soon as in power became divided into two parties the
                        Moderates, and the [ntran- sigents, and Antiphon became an important member
                        of the extremist section if not its real leader. Finding their position
                        becoming more insecure, the Oligarchy,to enable themselves to have a free
                        hand to combat the democracy, decided to treat with the Lacedemonias and
                        sent Antiphon and 11 other delegates to Sparta.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after the return of the plenipoten- tiaries the four hundred were
                        overturned and many of them exiled, or fled. Antiphon re- mained. He was,
                        however, soon charged with treason, the crime being having been a mem- ber
                        of the embassy to Sparta, but at his trial the additional count was made of
                        having helped to destroy the constitution.</p>
                    <p>The speech which he delivered in his own defence Thucydides tells us "was the
                        finest ever pronounced." It did not, however, prevent his condemnation to
                        death.</p>
                    <p>The admiration expressed by Thucydides was repeated by other classic authors,
                        and still more effectively as proof of its truth by subse- quent orators who
                        imitated and probably also copied from it in addresses for others when
                        arraigned for alleged political misdemeanours.</p>
                    <p>It may be therefore that if we could detect such plagiarisms or similarities,
                        we could 'res- tore much of the famous speech, but practically it has
                        hitherto been completely lost except for a few citations by grammarians and
                        lexico- Graphers.</p>
                    <p>To-day however the long wished for event of the recovery of this celebrated
                        specimen of the forensic oratory, and the logic and argnu- ments of the
                        master of the Greek language and forms of thought ; has come to pass, and
                        Egypt is again the treasure house wherein has been stored, and now restored,
                        to us this precious fragmerit of ancient literature, for as we shall see we
                        have not now a complete edition of Antiphon's speech but only a considerable
                        portion thereof.</p>
                    <p>Last winter M. Jules Nicolle of Geneva, who had some years ago acquired for
                        the Museum of that city a most valuable collection. of Egyptian papyri,
                        visited Egypt again with the object of obtaining a further number of
                        mabuscripts, and there among a quantity which he purchased were four
                        portions of the apology of Antiphon; originally elegantly written "upon
                        beautiful paper, evidently an exemplar de luxe".</p>
                    <p>The texts upon the four parts preserved are of unequal length and appareatly
                        separated a good deal from each other. Thus several columns of writing are
                        evidently from the argument whilst others appertained to the exposition of
                        facts, and some to the perora- tion This accidental arrangement of the newly
                        found fragment is happily however rather advantageous. The fourfold extracts
                        present a better view of the general plan of the discourse than a continuous
                        piece of equal length would have done.</p>
                    <p>We can now follow not only the system upon which Antiphon founded his
                        defence, but also the role which he explains he followed as chief of his
                        party, and also as an improvised adminis- trator in the great crisis in
                        which he became involved. We see him suddenly taking the offensive against
                        his accusers, and then when, according to custom, the moment had arrived to
                        appeal to the compassion of his judges, he alludes to his family, his
                        children and grand- children as interceding tor him.</p>
                    <p>Historically also the allusions iv his argu- ment are most Valuable. The
                        illustrious names of principle parties to the revolution appear such as
                        Pisander, Phrynichus, and Theramenes.</p>
                    <p>The most lengthy fragment fortunately dis- closes to us the position thought
                        best for taking up by an Athenian orator and, perliaps, immature statesman
                        in face of a terrible accusation levelled against himself. He not only
                        denies participating in the overthrow of the democracy but says he never
                        dreamt of it. What then made him join the oligarchy ? He alleges the force
                        of circumstances saying they only had determined Bis conduct.</p>
                    <p>He endeavours to prove his only leader was patriotism, never ambition, and
                        still less private interest.</p>
                    <p>Had he consulted the last no one would bave more ardently maintained the
                        democratic constitution. It is evident that it was the -foree and eloquence
                        with which he developes <cb n="5"/> this part of his apology that caused
                        later speakers in similar critical circamétances, to envy his great effort
                        and his words. It is probable Antiphon had but the morroy of his indictment
                        in which to prepare his defence, moreover the accusation, as stated, was
                        amended by the addition, and he had in his speech to reply on the spur of
                        the moment to the attack of his foes ot whose line of address he had no
                        previous warning. Also he needed to suit his words to the audience and
                        consequently doubtless changed in his speech, the form he had. previously
                        selected for many parts of it.</p>
                    <p>The literary perfection of the speech seems to show that between the vocal
                        deliverance of it and the condemnation ; and the execution of his sentence,
                        he was able to work at the matter so as to prepare it for publication.
                        Before he drank the deadly draaght, his last moments may have been occupied
                        in editing these lines, which now after the lapse of centuries can be
                        perused once again. The very thought of such a thing makes it impossible to
                        read without emotion these sentences composed so along ago and returned to
                        mankind, let us hope, not only to never be lost again but to be augmented
                        and perhaps completed, by the finding of another copy of what may thus
                        correctly be rallied the immortal Apology of Antiphon.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT" AND BABYLONIA COMPARED. </head>
                    <p>The last lecture of the course on the com- parison of Egypt and Babylonia was
                        given by Professor Flinders Petrie at University College last Thureday. The
                        poetic oracles in parallel verses, and with repetition of a refrain as in
                        the Psalms, were compared with the long poem with refrains in honour of
                        Senusert in Egypt. Probably both have their source in the Orien- tal custom
                        of one inventive man starting a series of imprompta lines, between each of
                        which the rest of a working groap shout out a fixed refrain. This is
                        commonly done while en- gaged in united work like~baaling, and a si- milar
                        form may well have been used in reli- gious meetings, which are now confined
                        to mere repetition, as in the zikrs.</p>
                    <p>The ,penitential psalms of Babyloni similar'to the Hebrew Psalms, find no
                        para aI in Egypt, where introspection and self-accusa- tion were as little
                        known as in ancient Greece. The prayer of Ashur Canipal and the Divine
                        answer is hardly treated so finely as the battle prayer of Rameses and its
                        answer. The custom of writing curses was usual in Baby- lonia as in Greece,
                        but such are rare in Egypt, and only belong to the age of the Shihaks under
                        Mesopotamian influence. The impor- tant literatare of the cosmogony, so
                        similar to Genesis, is entirely different in Egypt, and this shows that the
                        two stocks of population were entirely distinct, as the fundamental ideas of
                        the how and why of things are most unalterable.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the interesting class of letters was touched on ; such are far
                        commoner in Baby- lonia than in Egypt, and the perishable natare of papyrus
                        compared with clay tablets accounts for the difference. The comparison of
                        the two civilizations is of great value for showing the strong points of

                        <p>To The Editor of The "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir,-Out of the multitudinal rumours with which Cairo 'is filled
                            regariling the probable effect of the 1908 badget upon the. varions
                            administrations in Egypt, the one which states that there will be a more
                            or less general reduc. tion in the number of officials would appear to
                            be the most probable, for the fact is already Ae- sured that the number
                            in the Tanzim ia to be reduced and there is no reason to suppose that
                            this will be by any means an isolated instance, for the Tanzim, more
                            especially the Towns and Buildings department, which happens to be the
                            particular one threatened, is necessarily ja most important one, and one
                            which is bound to inerease in size and in importance as the country
                            still further developes. The budget is yearly &amp; source of great
                            interest, and this year it is particularly so, as there has been so much
                            speculation on the matter of the reductions of the various staffs that
                            no particular depart ment feels safe for the future. Freom a super
                            ficial standpoint it would saturrally appear to the outsider that the
                            despartment under whose jurisdiection the streets of Cairo fall would be
                            one which might be reduced with the 'least harmful results since it
                            makes no tiiagible use of the money which is yearly allotted to them,
                            and on the principle that things could not be worse than they are at
                            present, it would certain- ly seem that this money being for the moat
                            part simply wasted through bed management, no good result would accrue
                            were it incréased a thousand fold.</p>
                        <p>But if this is the case with this particular department it is far from
                            being so with the majority of the others, and it is "a matter for
                            sincere regret that the existing state ot finan- ces will in all
                            probabity not permit of the hoped for increases in the pay of the Native
                            staff in many of the hard working and res- ponsible branches of the

                            the responsibility undertaken and the skill required by: . its
                            officials. Rents have been a very-serious con- sideration for a long
                            time past but it ionly recently that food has taken such a sudden rise
                            in price and increased the difficulties of living to an @xtraordinary
                            height, and if the advances in rent and living which at présent obtain
                            are sustained it will become almest an impossibiljty to exist in the
                            town on salaries which were formerly more that sufficient.</p>
                        <p>It would be greatly to the. benefit of both the Government and its
                            employes if the former would take the question of the housing of its
                            minor officials immediately in hand and build them dwelling places in
                            Cairo which could be advantageously let at reasonable prices, the in-

                            whileit would once and for all settle the burning question of rents,
                            and, obviate themecessity of calling for continual drains from the
                            Government, who increase the salaries of its officials only to fill the
                            pockets of individual speculators who were fortunate enough to secure
                            land in the haleyon days, which are now, we may say fortunately for
                            Cairo, over.</p>
                        <p>I have no wish for speenlation, as specula- tion, on the part of the
                            Government, but in a case such a this where the interests of the vast
                            number of its servants are in question, then it becomes a necessity for
                            some step to be taken in order to relieve the depression cansed by the
                            enofmous rentals demanded by private property owners.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afteroooh the Port Said Inter- national Sporting Cleb indulged in a
                        little hockey pracfice. 'There was a good attendance of last year's players
                        and several new hands were also noticed. Among the latter was E. Cassar who
                        played a very hard game. This year's hockey team shoold prove themselves
                        equal to any team which is likely to visit us during the season. The most
                        conspicuous players this afternoon were Messrs. J. Chesman, ©. Broatch,
                        Ingram and Cassar.</p>
                    <p>Oar Association Football XI should also prove stronger than last year.
                        Judging from last week's practice, and if the team would anly do a little
                        more training, they should have a very successful season.</p>

                    <head>THE MAGIC OF THE SPADE.<lb/> EGYPT AND WESTERN ASIA.</head>
                    <p>By W. Sr. Cuap Boscawen.</p>
                    <p>The activity in Oriental exploration during recent years has been snch that
                        the time 'has come for a gegeral summary of results to be made. The
                        important discoveries in Egypt, especially in the reali of prehistoric:and
                        'earty dynastic times, has added new and important chapters to the history
                        of Egypt, while in Western Asia the work of the Amertean, French, and others
                        in Chaldea and Swsianoria have produced such results as to completely
                        revolutionise all previous conclusions. " 'The great work of Professor
                        Maspero on the "Anvient History of the Peoples of the Rast," painstaking as
                        it was, is flow archaic, and the Christian Knowledge Soviety, ~who' pu-
                        blished it, have done well in entrustitig the compilation of a new and
                        comptehehsive 'work on the subject to Mr. L. W! Ring and Mr. H. R: 'Hall, of
                        the British Museum. In this new work, "Egypt and Western Asia in the Light
                        of Recent Discovery," we have the latest results of research from the Hants
                        of "expert authorities.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian and Caneifotm scholars," but have each carried ont extensive
                        explorations, and each has a thorough ktiowledge ofthe countries which have
                        been the seats of great civilisations. Mr. Ha!l's account of prehistoric
                        Egypt is excellent. His deseription of the early races of the Nile Valley is
                        free from the rash dog- matism which characterised the work of so many
                        previous writers. It is marked by a clear statement of the tacts, and then
                        followed by a clear summarisation of results. His account of the incoming of
                        Asiatic influences is certainly new and important, and his sug- gestion that
                        the custom of dull length berial and mummification was derived from Baby-
                        lonia is most striking. He compares the burial scenes on the "Shell of the
                        Vultures," and his arguments are most convincing. It is the burial customs
                        of the ancient Egyptians that tell us most of their early story, and these
                        he describes very clearly. He notes every impor- tant discovery, describes
                        its value, and assigns it to its proper place in history, and it will be
                        along time before his work will need revi sion. The account of the
                        discoveries at Deir el Bahari, and of the royal tombs at 'hebes is most
                        clear, coming from one who had taken part ifi the explorations, or was on
                        the spot at the time when the diseoveries were made. His remarks on the
                        hoenter, 'King Khu-en-Aten or Amenophis IV. will be of especial value at the
                        present time, when so much controversy is being carried on regarding the
                        body found in the supposed tomb of Queen Tie.</p>
                    <p>In dealing with the recent discoveries in Western Asia Mr. King has a far
                        darger field to cover, but he brings to his work a specialist's knowledge
                        which Professor Maspero did not possess.</p>
                    <p>The important discoveries daring recent years in Babylon, Assyria, Asia
                        Minor, Armenia, Xc., are described as the reconstruc- tion of the history of
                        Western Asia, is ac- complished in a manner which will astonish many who
                        have hitherto bad no idea of the perfect articulation there is between the
                        varions histories of the nations of the ancient East. For the first time the
                        anthor sets before usa: cleaft picture of the ancient Sumerian civilisation.
                        He shows from the inscriptions from Tel-lo, and especially from the long
                        text of the cylinders of Gudea, how perfect it was in its patriarchal
                        simplicity. Its indigenous character is now beyond doubt, and there is
                        revealed to us apatient plodding and highly inventive people, who have just
                        claim to be regarded as the founders of the world's civilisa- tion. They
                        were not aggresive, making but few conquests, contenting themselves with
                        holding their own against their neighbours, and especially their hereditary
                        foe the ElaVites. To this wonderful people we must look for the invention of
                        writing, of mathematics, geometery, agriculture, anfl most ofthe elements of
                        calture.</p>
                    <p>With the advent of the Semites, a great change took place ; and certainly for
                        the good of humanity in general. With that wotderfol, adaptive faculty which
                        charactherises 'the Semite, we find them borrowing from the Su- meriens
                        their writing, social laws, mathemAatios, especially in relation to trade.
                        It is the'old story, so often repeated, of the physically stronger being
                        conquered intellectually by the weaker. 'The most important and fat-reaching
                        result which Mr. King pots most clearly before us was the propagation of
                        this acquired calture hy the Semites. The energetic Semite soon brought it
                        under his rule By conquest and peaceful commerce, he spread the Babylonian
                        language and laws from the 'Tigris to thehanks of the Halyo. Semitic
                        Babylonian became the French of the ancient East, the language of diplomacy
                        and commerce.</p>

                        officials of the Em- band y' arid: Goriswlate'and besiness men, he (Sir Ada:
                        Blook) pleads for hetp. for the recently- founded soliook for English boys
                        in Constanti- nople. We lave great tradeinterests in Turkey That' they are
                        not 'greater than they are, and that'they are not expanding as rapidly as
                        the imtetests of other nations, is largely dne to the deplorable warit of
                        practical 'education among the Englismen who go there, and among their
                        children. In no place in-the-world is that grave fault of the English
                        character; the unwilling- ness to'take' trauble in-edaecating oneself, more
                        cohspicaous than in Tarkey. To a young Ger- man, &amp; Frenchman, or a
                        Greek, it is a compel- ling and instinctive prineiple that the foanda- tion
                        of success in business is a knowledge of certain necessary things, the first
                        being the langaage of the people with whom he has to trade. Among the
                        English trading classes, at home and abroad, such a belief is rare. The
                        contrast is reflested in'w most painful way in the action of the different
                        Governments with regard to their subjects in Turkey. As Sir Adam Block
                        points out, France spends £12,000 a year on French sebools in Turkey ;
                        Germany, which - assigns £89,500 a year to: German schools abroad, gives
                        £1,000 of this to its schoo! at Constantmople; and Italy, Austria, and
                        Rassia' also 'subsidize their schools in the Turkish Empire. What does
                        England do! [n | reply to astrong memorial to the Treasury, fron the
                        Eaglishmen who are reponsible for the new school, the Treasary refused all
                        help, on the ground that there was 'no precedent." We really thought that
                        the days of that old phrase were long smce numbered. If, however, it is to
                        be used again, we would remark that there is no precedent for the acuteness
                        of foreign competition which now exists at Constantinople as'elsewhere ; and
                        that there was no precedent for the very meritorious action of the present
                        Government, when, in conjunc- tion with France, it supported the
                        co-operation of the Bank of England with French capitalists in purchasing
                        the quays at Constantinople one of the most important measares taken for
                        asserting the community of Anglo-French com- mercial interests in the Near
                        East. Sir Edward Grey, indeed, has shown himself very creditably alive to
                        the importance of developing oar trade with Turkey ; and that matter of the
                        quays, together with his successful pressure for the extension of the
                        Smyrnha-Aidin railway and of steamer facilities on the Tigris, is a happy
                        proof of what may be done. We cannot help thinking that, if he seriously
                        considered the case of this school at Constantinople, he would induce the
                        Treasury to make the prece dent 'that 'they have 'sought for in vain. It'
                        seems to be impossible to make the s¢hool self-supporting ; but then
                        education is never self-supporting, Our primary schools are paid tor by
                        grants and rates, and neither Eton and Harrow nor Oxford and Cambridge could
                        do the work they do if it were not for their endowments. Here at 'least are
                        "prece dents" for the Treasury. The sun thatit is asked to sapply is 'very'
                        swall—too small, we we should Love thought. If Germany finds £1,000 a year
                        for its boys and girls at Constanti- nople, England might surely find the
                        same. However, ifSir Adam Block's Committee are satisfied for the present
                        with £200, that sum daght to be te ly given, if only to prevent the Bnaglet
                        children at Constantinople from becoming Levantines, with no national
                        edneation and the proper sense of the country from which they spring. If
                        this is done, there may ultimately be some. hope that, when a roam
                        Englishman at Constantinople offers imself for a post, it will not be found
                        neces sary, as Sir Adam Block, with his experience as head of a
                        great-revenue administration, tells ns is very often the case at present, to
                        pass him over beeause his German or Greek coin- petitor is much better

                    <p>Décidément la question des dossiers &amp; liqui der arrive A |'ordre du jour.

                    <p>Nous détachons de notre correspondance de Londres, les passages suivants
                        :</p>
                    <p>"Malgré la crise américaine et les difficultés monétaires et boursiéres

                        elle a été du moins raisonnable.</p>
                    <p>"C'est moins la crise américaine que la hausse successive du taux de la

                        confiance que professionnels et capitalistes leur conser- vent, elles ont
