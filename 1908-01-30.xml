                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM </head>
                    <p>The following extract is from the interesting lecture on "The White Nile and
                        the Cotton Crop", delivered by Sir William WilloockK.C.MG FRGS, in
                        continuation of his lecture delivered on 27th Dec. 1907, at a meeting of the
                        Khedivial Geographical Society on Saturday. Sir William looks to the
                        construction of a barrage at the point of junction of the Blue and White
                        Niles at Khartoum as the most necessary engineering effort whiob onald be
                        made to save Egypt from the disastrous effects of a low Nile, which though
                        considerably reduced since the construction of the Assouan dam are still a
                        menace to the country. For a sum of less than LE 8,000,000, he affirms that
                        works sufficient for the storing of three milliards of cubic metres of water
                        would be complisher, and the Assuan tr servoir surpasword many times. Toe
                        pasag dealing with the raining of the Dam is as</p>
                    <p>follows:</p>
                    <p>Out of the six milliards cubic metres of water needed for Egypt, the Assouan
                        reservoir will be in a position to supply two For the other four milliards
                        we have only to turn to tbo terminal reach of the White Nilo with <cb n="6"

                        kilometres and a slope of 1 100,000 in the remaining 500. Nature, which has,
                        as a rule, been so niggardly in Africa bas opened ber lap to Egypt and given
                        of ber good things with a tree hand. While Egypt needed lain in gation for

                        the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Since giving my last lecture on the reservoir of the White Nile it has been
                        pointed out to me that the late Sir Betijamin Paker only recommended the
                        raising of the Assuan dam by 7 metres as a counsel of despair His opi Diuis
                        contained in Blue Brok Egypt No. 7 of 1907, which appeared when I was ill
                        and when no professional literatnre was allowed to enter my bands. I have
                        just seen it. Here are his words: "If additional water is a national necer
                        sity. I bave no hesitation in recommending that the raising and
                        strengthening of the</p>
                    <p>ovan dam, in accordance with the designs submitted, be carried out, no
                        alternative plan of a resonable and practical kind can, in my pinion, be
                        deviser for storing the required quantity of water." Sir Benjamin bad dover

                    <p>The White Nile from Khartoum right op to Lake No is, as has been already
                        pointed out, very nearly a lake in flood and would stay lake for ever if the
                        Blue Nile were subjeot to perpetual finod. Hetween low summer and high flood
                        there is a difference of 8 metres. We want a masonry works which will keep
                        this impounded water where it is when the Blue Nile has tailen, and deliver
                        it just when we need it, pot superabundantly in the latter balf of Ootober,

                        impounding furtber metres, would between them form a reservoir of
                        extraordinary magnitude. The reservoir woull contain some three milliards of
                        oubio metres of water, and would suffice fur Egypt and the Sudan for many
                        years If this combination were not considered the best, a combinationof
                        barrage at the junction of the Blue And White Niles with another at the Aba

                        bring us to the conceptions of the builders of the Pyramids and the
                        construoton of Lake Mæris. Not only cald we store all the water veeded tor
                        Egypt and the Sudan, but I believe we could bave such an effect on a very
                        bigb Nile that the dangers of an inundation would materially be decreased.
                        We are on the thres bold of as wonderful andas startling discoverins as any
                        made by any hydraulic engineers in the world to begin with, three years
                        would suffice to carry out the preliminary works storing three milliards of
                        cubic, metres of water, while the onet would be under L.B. 3,000,000. The
                        Assuan reservoir would be surpassed many times</p>
                    <p>But whatever works are carried out anywhere, the necessity of a reservoir at
                        Assuno remains unaffected. This question was give into thor oughly, and this
                        is the opinion we came to. I quote from my 1895 Report: "We have con cluded
                        that it is absolutely necessary in the interest of irrigation to bave near
                        at band, at the point where the Nile euters Egypt, a reserve of water to
                        meet any contingencies which inight arina. There contingencies might arise
                        from the fact that some of the more important su un mer crops are incapable
                        of standing ten-days' drought, while the summer discharge of reservoirs bigh
                        up the Nile would take many days to rowoh Egyps, and might sometimes be late
                        in arriving"</p>

                    <p>The efforts made by the management of Shepheard's Hotel to restrict the
                        number of invitations to their balcotillon were evidently of no avail, for
                        the attendance even greater than last year, when if we remember rightly the
                        numbers totalled about 1,200 persona. 80 great was the crusb in the hotel at
                        ten o'clock on Wednesday that it ww matter of great difficulty to arrive
                        even so farm the dressing rooms, and there women solute dead block in the
                        partage leading to the ballroom. lo spite of the numbers however, which
                        after all proved the enormous popularity of the function, the hell was most
                        wonderfully successful one, and, if ones memories are trifle bary after such
                        an orening, they retain impressions all of the pleasetest nature.</p>
                    <p>Brilliant illuminations and masses of foliage decorated the handsome ballroom
                        with its splendid floor bordered by long rows of chairs Subdued coloured
                        lights abone over the e deductive furnishings and through the softly falling
                        fountain of water in the mljoining spacious wlon and in ballroom, salons,
                        parrages, Egyptian ball and everywhere, such crowds of people were gathered
                        that the babel of cherry voices and the music of happy laughter at times
                        almost overpowered the strains of the orobestias</p>
                    <p>The chief interest centred naturally in the ballroom, where rows of
                        spectators lined the walls so deeply that there was but little space left
                        for those who wished to dance. There was but little hope of ever finding
                        one's partners, and the programs, arranged so hastily friend drifted past
                        friend in the crowd collected in the passages, were nseless after they once
                        were parted. Bat a reeri minations on either side of the compact were
                        futile, no ill-feeling was evinced, and for the most part people spent each
                        number of the programme happily enough with those who happened to be nearest
                        to them at the moment</p>
                    <p>The great event of the evening naturally was the cotillon placed between the
                        fifth and sixth dance, when the ranks of spectators became so dense that
                        those participating in it could scarcely force their way through, in spite
                        of the ropes which were supposed to clear the space for them. A committee of
                        ladies and gentlemen had been elected to assist in the proceeding, the
                        leading part being vested in Mrs. Irene Harvey and her squire Dr. Brabant.
                        These two followed by their committee and many other couples made the
                        circuit of the room carrying the insignia of their office, brilliant orders
                        and gay rosettes, dainty chapend on the heads of the ladies, white paper
                        peroques and three cornered hats giving a somewhat incongraona appearance to
                        their cavaliers. The ladies also carried long branches of enormous paper
                        flowers, so that as they tripped up and down to gayest strains of music, the
                        centre of the room took the effect of an ever revolving kaleidoscope.
                        Eventually they took their positions</p>
                    <p>to leave DATTOW passage down the centre leading from end to end, and, the
                        long curtains suddenly parted, there appeared · tiny flower decked sleigh
                        drawn by tiny donkey and occupied by three tiny mites clad in soft white
                        furs. In place of snow Maker, Horal favours were soon talking through the
                        air, until the little chariot was bereft of all its decorations and
                        disappeared again behind the curtains. After this pretty surprised the floor
                        was taken by another little lady of tender years, Min Stella Sneath who
                        performed a very graceful little pas seul in a space which was all too small
                        for her pretty flutterings and gyrations. Owing to the press of the crowd it
                        was not able to continue the remainder of the cotillon figures, and soon the
                        buffet was thrown open, and the numbers thinned the ordinary pro Kram mewu
                        resumed. A word of congratulations and thanks to the management in bere due
                        for the excellence and superabundance of this aforementioned buffet, which
                        con taided all the elements necessary for substantial supper and enough
                        liquid refreshment to float first class dahabeah</p>

                        pre ment, but we have pleasure in mentioning those who were instrumental

                        <p>Sir, I have read in your paper of today the letter of an "Indignant
                            Britisher" who under the heading "A Disgrace to Alexandria" writes about
                            the standing of the sailing vessel under the very windows of the town
                            and who rightly indignant at the utter lack of bringing help to ships
                            which are in distress right at the mouth of the harbour in which they

                            great self denial went to the rescue of the crew who were being drowned
                            to their small boat had to fight with the count guard who wanted to
                            obstruct this act of humanity and they were beaten by infuriated
                            soldiers who, Mr. Polatschek wys were under the command of an officer of

                            that the exhausted wilors, instead of being brought to the hospital had
                            to pass the night in a wooden shanty on the shore! Were the authorities
                            afraid of cholera being brought to Egypt by a crew which had been
                            isolated on willing Vessel for weeks, or were they afraid that these
                            drowning sailors were trying to smuggle "hasheesh! If the officers in

                            question, having strict orders, bow is it that in such an urgent case
                            their chiefs were not there to decide immediately on a humane treatment
                            of the <cb n="3"/>victims of the accident! The whole town knew that a
                            ship was in diesem What did the goal ling station dot Nothing whatever,
                            mit ap pears, and the only intervention of the authority consisted in a
                            trial to prevent the crew being saved. If this be true, who is
                            responsible for such a cruel absurdity!</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that this port is badly in need of Lifeboat and general
                            resume orige In Europe a great deal is done by benevolent contributia
                            and borders of life are uved every year through bonta kept by benevolent
                            fanda, but it is probably very difficult to arrive at a solution of the
                            question in this way in Egypt. Your correspondent "Humanitas" proposes
                            that the funds saboribed to the Lord Cromer Memorial might be deployed
                            to the purchasing and the endowing of litebont, but I think that this is
                            a matter of consideration for the British Colony in this country alone
                            and not the appropriate way of doing things. There is no doubt that the
                            Egyptian Government har the urgent duty to take this matter in band. The
                            most efficient way of providing constant fond for a rescue tag and
                            lifeboat station would be to take a certain tax from the tonnage of
                            crafts frequenting the barbour, but don are already heavy enough and
                            should not be in creared Shipping pays enormous amounts yearly into the
                            Porta and Lights Administration and there is no doubt that certain
                            amount of the sums paid by sbipe coming to this barbour should be
                            employed for offering safety to ships and passengers not only by
                            breakwaters and quay but also by the necessary appliances to rescue
                            crafts and lives which are in danger right in view of the cost</p>
                        <p>If the Government takes the initiative there is no doubt that voluntary
                            contribution will also come forward. The porchase and endowing of
                            litebost does not cost an enormous som and the corporation of the pilota
                            which gains</p>
                        <p>goort deal of money through the privileges given them should be obliged
                            the first to help ships which come here to bring them profit and should
                            furnish the hands to mana boat. I'p to now they seem to be after their
                            protit only without any sense of moral responsibility</p>
                        <p>The name of Lord 'roter has been men troped and there is no doubt that he
                            still has a keen interest in the welfare of Boynt which country he has
                            tried to TRIME into the groep of civilized nations. His support or
                            influence would certainly be of great help in the matter under
                            discussion, but we must not forget that bus successor with us and I
                            think that we shall see that Sir Eldon Gorst will be one of the first to

                        racing looked poor, but the come dried in wondertel way and the going w
                        excellent-josta we bit soft in few places but nothing to matter the times
                        were naturally not as fast a s a hard course</p>
                    <p>Sir Eldos aod Lady Gorst were present and the attendance was decidedly
                        good.</p>
                    <p>The fields in some of the race dwindleri down rather, but we witnessed some
                        very good finishes in the first race the starter pony broke loome and nosed
                        &amp; little diversion Nleyban ran a good noe, this is his second win this
                        season on this coure He is evidently</p>
                    <p>good pony - Add we wish his sporting owners further lack with him. The Grand
                        National Steeplechase was most interesting We are sorry to hear that Capt.
                        Drake dis located his shoulder when he came down on Chamı. It was feared the
                        pony was badly burt at first, but it was apparently only stunned, be so
                        bsequently got up and walked off. We congratulate Major Protheroe Smith on
                        his win on Petrone, he certainly deserves a turn of luck</p>
                    <p>Hector ran well for second place and Chater made a good deal of the running
                        at first, but could not quite last Mr. Evane on Fares had the bad luck to
                        lose a stirrup, and this handi capped him a good deal in the third toe.
                        Digby rode an excellent roe and matched the victory from Piers, who at one
                        time seemed to hold the Thor. In the fourth event, Karl Cedar was made
                        favourite be ran well and looked like winning. Reyal Medallist, bowever,
                        lasted better and won by 19 lengths Red Cedar is a first class wanty bred,
                        bred in Bopt by Mr. Branch, and it in a notable feet that he can run with
                        and bent a good many English thorough bred borser. This is an instance of
                        what can be done in the borse breeding line in Egypt, and ought to encourage
                        owners to take it up to a greater extent in the 5th race the start was not
                        quite so good as usual. Speculation weut off at a great pace, but was caught
                        by Sartik and had to be content with cond place. Abou Nadara won the last
                        race comfortably. Digos scoring his second win for the day</p>

                        de hau teur. M. D. Rieti a fait ressortir que la ville était pauvre en
                        monumenta, qa'elle abritait une forte colonie italienne laborieuse, quel vre
                        contribuerait a l'ornementation de la ville et qu'il ne serait pas mauvais

                        l'espoir que M Salvago, membre du conseil d'administration de la Compagnie
                        des Eaux plaiders cette cause devant ses collègues Le Dr Valensin appuie
                        cette motion et prie la Compagnie de se montrer un peu plus charitable
                        envers le public, il rappelle que lean constitue le prin cipal véhicule de
                        toutes les maladies M Sal vago répond qu'il n'est pas au courant des
                        desideratas de la Monicipalite mais que lui et ses collègues sont disposés
                        faire tout ce qu'ils peuvent pout prévenir une épidémie en ville. Abani bey,
                        tout en remerciant M Sal vago pour ses assurances, dit que le public est aux
                        prises avec des employés qui sont animés de tout autres sentiments. Il
                        voudrait que M. Salvago et ses collègues s'occupent de morti fier cette
                        mentalité de leur personnel, qui ne prête pas foi aux coutrata de location
                        qu'on lui présente En outre, la Compagnie devrait donner plus de publicité
                        &amp; son tarif la masse ignore qu'on peut s'abonner pour 10 PT par mois si
                        elle le savait elle s'abonnerait De plus, dans son propre interet et dans
                        celui de la population, la Compagnie des Eaux devrait faire certaines
                        concessions. Quant aux enter rements, dont il est question dans le rapport
                        de l'inspecteur sanitaire, Abani bey trouve qu'il y a ambiguité et qu'avec
                        des agents de récution qui ne sont genéralement pas tres intelligents il
                        serait nécessaire de préciser il fait remarquer ensuite que le person nel de
                        désinfection étant recruté parmi des vagabonds sans foi ni loi, il y aurait
                        lieu du moins de choisir avec soin les chefs d'équipe pour surveiller leurs
                        faits et gee tes. Cette réforme est nécessaire pour en courager le public

                        d'avis qu'on vote quelque chose de précis. Sur sa proposition et après les

                        renvoyée sur la proposition de M. l'Administrateur à la Déléga tion qui est

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>

                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
