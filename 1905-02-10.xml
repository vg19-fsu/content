                        was a party to the convention with a certain reservaation which, she
                        maintained, absolved her from complaince with its stupulations in 1898. By
                        the anglo-french agreement of april 8 1904, she declared her adherence to
                        the stipulations of the suez canal treat, but that- i am quoting from the
                        anglo french agreement itself- the last sentence of paragraph 1 and that of
                        paragraph 2 of article VIII. of this treaty will remain suspended. Is not
                        this another reservation which, unimportant though it be, may enable her, at
                        any time, to take up the position which she assumed in 1898, or, by parity
                        of reasoning, enable other powers to maintain that the suez canal convention
                        is inoperative. I confess that i do not consider the situation as entirely

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE. FEDORA</head>
                    <p>The performance of fedora at the khedivial opera house last night, thanks to
                        signa pandolfini, was a great success. Signa pandolfini is a thorough
                        artiste and an actress of a very high order. Her rendering of fedora was, if
                        possible, better than her tosca. Signor Giraud was variable, though
                        undoubtedly good in the last act; his singing in the second act was not at
                        all that we should have wished: he sang more than once sharp (one natural
                        was turned into sharp) and did not always seem to have hold of his note.
                        Inaccuracies were numerous and hardly justified, and he seems to have a
                        difficulty in taking really high notes. We may mention a most admirable high
                        C by signa pandolfini. Signor rubini delivered his solo very effectively in
                        act 1. Signor Polese was good and sang well, but he has not the sme chance
                        as in la tosca; he is a real chef de police, and as such probably finds
                        diplomacy too tame an occupation. The chorus is unusually good, and the
                        khedivial theatre heave-in that branch-spent their money to real advantage.
                        Indeed, in theatrical accessories cairo need not fear competition, so long
                        as the present conditions are in force. Rigoletto is to be given tonight. We
                        hope that some improvement will be effected therein. In this connection it
                        is interesting to note that in alexandria-as in cairo-signor tomisani seems
                        to have scored a brilliant success in that opera. Though our fellow critics
                        may take exception to his methods, a glance at the scores of the operas in
                        which he sings will show that he handles his high notes with an ease and
                        dexterity apparently foreign to his better known rivals of the state
                        theatre. Whatever his compatriots may think of his tone, it undoubtedly
                        pleases the anglo-saxon in general; and we could wish that-but we are
                        criticising the khedivial theatre, and it is as well to remind our readers
                        that siberia, also by giordano (whose compositions seem to be above the
                        average) will be given on saturday. Let us mention, before we close, that
                        signora tromben really showed to advantage in her part. As long as great and
                        startling efforts are not required of her, she is quite pleasing.</p>
                    <p>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE. I PURITANI</p>
                    <p>The performance of I Puritani yesterday evening served once more to show the
                        incomparable talent of signora isabella svicher. this gifted ladys vocal
                        organs are very extended; she possesses more than three octaves, which is
                        phenomenal. She recieved a perfect ovation at the end of the 2nd act, and
                        was repeatedly called before the curtain. Sig tomisani, in the difficult
                        role of lord arthur, also obtained a great success, and sig. baldelli, as
                        sir george, distinguished himself. We were more than surprised to find a
                        sparsely filled house last night. It is astonishing that, when such a rare
                        opportunity of hearing one of the bright particular lights of the operatic
                        world is afforded alexandrians, they do not flock to the theatre. A more
                        fickle public than is that of alexandria it would be impossible to find. Has
                        a soiree noire, with all its debasing suggestiveness, been announced, it
                        would be safe to say that the playhouse, which is now adorned by such
                        brilliant artistes, would have been filled to overflowing. Tomorrow evening,
                        carmen will be given, with signa bellincioni in the leading role, and we
                        hope to see a bumper house.</p>

                    <head>A BEDOUIN OUTRAGE. EUROPEAN ATTACKED NEAR SUEZ</head>
                    <p>From our correspondent <placeName>Suez</placeName>, February 9 A european
                        named gilbert, who had failed to find employment at suez, decided to go to
                        suakin, and not having money to pay his passage, set out on the 25th ganuary
                        last en route for suakin on foot. His belongings he carried on his back in a
                        bag which contained papers of identity, certificates, a knife, paper, pen
                        and pencils, the sum of P.T. 9.5, a pair of boots, and some clothes. For
                        provisions he had only a bag of sea biscuits and he carried two empty water
                        bottles. On the morning of the 27th January, after having passed the attaka
                        mountains, he encountered near the shore about half a dozen native
                        fishermen, who recieved him cordially and gave him fish and bread to eat.
                        After a good rest, gilbert proceeded in the direction of the mountains,
                        where he took shelter for the night. Early on the following day, he
                        descended the mountains and went on his way, meeting with no untoward
                        incident, but next day, at about noon, he encountered two bedouins, whom he
                        asked for water. The latter gave him to understand that if he followed them
                        they would take him to some wells, which the traveller did without the
                        slightest suspicion. On the way he made them aware of the fact that he was a
                        poor man, and that on account of this he was obliged to walk to suakin in
                        order to find employment. After several hours walk, seeing no trace of
                        water, and being exhausted, he proposed that they should all have a rest,
                        and accordingly sat down on a rock. Suddenly the younger of the bedouins,
                        who was at a distance of about 50 yards from gilbert, began to swear at him,
                        and raising his gun, fired. Gilvert was slightly wounded in the back, but
                        his bag prevented a serious wound. The bedouin afterwards reloaded his gun
                        and asked gilbert to place all his belongings at a certain spot. This was
                        done without hesitation. While the bedouin was occupied with his gun,
                        gilbert managed to creep from rock to rock, and, favored by the darkness,
                        succeeded in eluding the bedouins. After a long march the whole of the night
                        he arrived at daybreak at a small coast guard station, where he was well
                        recieved. Here he remained till the 1st inst., when he was offered a camel,
                        and, in company of a coast guard named mahmoud, he reached the attaks
                        mountains, where there is a coast guard station. The governor of Suez was at
                        once advised of the matter, and, accompanied by the chief of the police, a
                        doctor, and several gendarmes, proceeded to the spot to hold an enquiry.
                        Finally, gilvert was conveyed to the french hospital at suez, where he still
                        remains, on account of his wounds.</p>

                            points, but after this was unable to get going agin for some time. his
                            opponent meanwhile, by breaks of 20,12, and 15, was forging ahead

                            the game well in hand, but the back mark man, nothing daunted, played a
                            most plucky game, and ultimately won, amidst great applause, by the
