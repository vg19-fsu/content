                    <head>AERIAL WARFARE POSSIBILITIES</head>
                    <p>France, which built the first ironclad and led the way in the cycle trade and
                        the motorcar industry, is also ahead in "conquest of the air," though
                        "paced" apparently by America. Already people other than pessimistic poets
                        begin to see visions of "aerial navies battling in the central blue." On the
                        occasion of the great military review in Paris last week, the cigar shaped
                        airship "La Patrie'' successfully executed a scries of manœuvres in mid-air.
                        Further testimony of the dirigible qualities of the "Patrie" was afforded on
                        July 22, when the Premier, M. Clemenceau, and the Minister for War, General
                        Picquart, made an ascent and manoeuvred about over the city of Paris for
                        several hours. In a subsequent interview M. Clemenceau said that he was very
                        favourably impressed by the wonderful sense of stability he experienced
                        during the trip. "One could not have felt more safe on the deck of a greet
                        liner," he said. "We descended, and so gently did the marvellous machine
                        alight that we did not know we had touched earth again until we were told
                        so." </p>
                    <p>According to the Paris correspondent of the "Daily Chronicle," several new
                        dirigibles on the model of the "Patrie" are being constructed forthwith, and
                        M. Julliot, the engineer of Messrs. Lebaudy Bross., and designer of the
                        "Patrie," counts upon introducing many improvements in the new airship. A
                        sum of £12,000 now remains on the estimates for the building of the new
                        ship, but the military commission is to ask Parliament for a fresh credit.
                        Although the "Lebaudy" was purchased for £4,000, the "Patrie" cost £14,000,
                        and this is to be the sum paid for the additional ships. M. Julliot is
                        certain that the "Patrie'' and airships of her class will play an important
                        part in the land war of the future. They would, he points out, be of
                        inestimable value to the commander of a besieged garrison. It is next to
                        impossible for artillery to hit a sphericalshaped mass fifty metres long
                        travelling at forty kilometres an hour at an altitude of 10 0 metres. </p>
                    <p>A story of how Germany has been trying to discover the secret of the
                        construction of the "Patrie" is published in the "Petit Parisien" and quoted
                        in the "Times." A company was founded last year in Germany for the study of
                        aerial navigation. Its manager, Herr von Kehler, jonrneyed to Paris in
                        September last to ask M. Julliot if he could construct "for sporting
                        purposes" a steerable balloon, like the one made by him for MM. Lebaudy. He
                        offered 1,000,000 marks (£50,000). M. Julliot induced Herr von Kehler to
                        write to MM. Lebaudy, who replied on the morrow : "We have to inform you
                        that we cannot, to our great regret, construct the steerable balloon that
                        you desire." </p>
                    <p>The rebuff was what was to be expected, but Germany did not abandon the hope
                        of securing the balloon by purchase, as certain facts which may ultimately
                        become known will prove. But, meanwhile, she is trying to copy the French
                        war balloon from such data as are already common property. Whether she will
                        succed is another matter, for while the general principles of construction
                        are well known, the delicate calculations concerning essential relations
                        between parts of the machine remain M. Julliot's secret. If France,
                        therefore, resolutely continues to construct a fleet of airships on his
                        model it will be difficult for any Power, even supposing the right formula
                        be found, to catch up with her. For as was indicated in the Paris
                        correspondence of the "Times," the training of the crews is, perhaps, more
                        than half the problem. The cigar shaped war ballon with which the German
                        authorities are experimenting made a successful ascent on July 23 from the
                        depot in Jungfernbeide, between Charlottenburg, and Spandau. During a cruise
                        of over three hours it appeared readily to answer the helm.</p>

                    <p>(From Our Own Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Aden, July 29. </p>
                    <p>Advices from Hodeida state that a batch of about 1,500 Turkish time-expired
                        troops have arrived there from Sana and other places for embarkation to
                        their homes. They waited there for some days but no transport steamer was
                        provided for them. As usual these discontented soldier have grown weary and
                        are giving great trouble to the people At Hodeida. They looted the shops and
                        houses of the natives, and had a fight with the latter, in which about 30
                        casualties have occurred. The natives have been closing their shops for
                        several days.</p>
                    <p>A few days previous to this, another batch of Turkish time-expired troops
                        proceeded to Hodeida for embarkation, and similarly looted the goods of the
                        natives, and several casualties occurred, and when they embarked they had a
                        fight amongst themselves on board the ship. It seems inexplicable why such
                        desperate troops should be let loose upon the natives before a transport
                        ship is arranged for, and there is no reason why a steamer should not be
                        chartered or a transport-ship brought to be ready for the day of the troops
                        arrival, for such occurrences are having disastrous moral effect. </p>
                    <p>News has reached Hodeida from Constantinople regarding the appointment of
                        General Raggeb Pasha as Military Commander in Yemen, but the appointment,
                        has not yet been officially announced. </p>
                    <p>It is reported that some Bedouins from the interior of Hodeida attacked a
                        house in Hodeida, and killed one of the inmates of the house and plundered
                        the property. </p>
                    <p>Aden, August 1. </p>
                    <p>Advices from Yemen state that the rebels have occupied several places and
                        strong positions lying between Hodeida and Sana. One of these places is
                        Mullian, a strong position about 2 days'journey northeast of Hodeida, and

                        by the inhabitants. </p>
                    <p>Another place captured by the rebels is Hatasli which liés about the same
                        distance from Hodeida as Mulhan. It is divided from Mulhan by a valley, and
                        is not garrisoned by Turkish troops. It was also taken without fighting. </p>
                    <p>The rebels attacked Al Muhwait, a Turkish coffee-growing centre lying about 3
                        days' journey from Hodeida. This district is inhabited by a comparatively
                        industrious people. The rebels plundered the inhabitants and captured a
                        number of them and conveyed them to the Imam. </p>
                    <p>A desperate body of the rebels under Ibn Hoobaish, who comes from the
                        district of Al Muhwait, and who has recently joined the standard of the
                        Imam, attacked Beni Kais, a district about one day's journey North-East of
                        Hodeida, and ruled by an Arab, Abdulla Pasha Al Boani, who is under the
                        protection of the Turks. The rebels had an engagement with Al Boani, in
                        which the latter last about 40. </p>
                    <p>Anis, a Turkish district lyving about two days' journey from Sana and not
                        garrisoned by Turkish troops, has been captured by the rebels without
                        resistance from the inhabitants. </p>
                    <p>Later advices from Hodeida state that the Turkish time-expired troops had
                        another fight with the natives, in which about six casualties of the former,
                        and about five of the latter have occurred.</p>

                    <head>WEATHER OF JULY</head>
                    <p>The following report on the weather of last month has been issued by the
                        Survey Department:- </p>
                    <p>As is usually the case at this time of the year, there has been but little
                        variation from day to day in the weather. Normal conditions have been
                        maintained over the Eastern Mediterranean, there being a steady gradient
                        towards the East over the sea and over Egypt. </p>
                    <p>In the Sudan, the summer depression which is probably connected with that of
                        Northwestern India in the monsoon season, has been fully developed in the
                        neighbourhood of Suakin, causing the usual southerly and southwesterly winds
                        in the Sudan. </p>
                    <p>Atmospheric pressure was above normal in Egypt but slightly below in the
                        Sudan. Mean temperature was slightly below the normal value everywhere
                        except at Merowe and El Obeid. </p>
                    <p>The rains, which had been weak in June, shewed but little improvement in
                        July, and, except at a few stations, the total fall was considerably below
                        the average. Ort the whole, this deficiency on the Abyssinian tableland
                        seems to have amounted to about 38 per cent, but during the last few days
                        there has been an improvement which is reported to extend to the Arabian Sea
                        and Northwest India. </p>

                    <p>Yesterday forenoon two huge Dutch dredgers the "Colonnia" and "Schelde," came

                        bound to Shanghai, but owing to one of the tugs having broken 3 blades of
                        her propeller in the Canal, their departure has been postponed till repairs

                    <head>THE BANDMANN FOLLIES.<lb/>AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION</head>
                    <p>Cairo, Monday. It is seldon,<!-- [sic] --> indeed, that members of the
                        British community in Cairo meet in such large numbers, as was the case
                        to-night in the Abbas Theatre on the occasion. of the first performance of
                        Mr. Bandmann's new troupe "The Follies," and the extent of the attendance
                        was as surprising to the audience itself, unhappily accustomed to half empty
                        theatres, as the packed house must have been gratifying to the actors and
                        actresses. From an early hour on Monday evening the doors of the theatre
                        were eagerly besieged by a crowd, who it was evident had omitted to reserve
                        their seats beforehand, and shortly before the curtain was timed to rise an
                        altogether exceptionally influx of people blocked the gangways. Fortunately
                        the building is a large one and everyone eventually succeeded in finding a
                        place. In short, the attendance was excellent and almost unique for a summer
                        entertainment of this kind. </p>
                    <p>The words of the opening chorus conveyed a lucid description of the artists'
                        powers, which afterwards were proved to be in no way exaggerated, but the
                        musical rendering offered small promise of the excellent programme, which
                        was in reality to follow. A certain amount of hesitation was noticeable,
                        unison was poor and the general idea given was that rehearsals had been
                        neglected. It is a pity that the very first item should have been so weak,
                        especially as one is inclined to form opinions, however erroneous, from the
                        opening turns. Fortunately, however, this was the only disappointing part of
                        a lengthy and really excellent entertainment. Mr. Villiers Arnold, who is a
                        powerful baritone, gave "Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes" in an exceedingly
                        pleasing way and there is no doubt that the applause, with which the song
                        was received, was thoroughly earned. In the second part of the programme his
                        song "The Mediterranean" was delivered with even more swing, and Mr. Arnold
                        is to be congratulated upon having an exceptionally melodious voice, which
                        is at the same time clear and strong. Miss Emilie Tait was the next to give
                        us a talented exhibition of her powers, and, though her voice is, perhaps, a
                        trifle small for so large a building as the Abbas Theatre, still the purity
                        of her notes and the sweetness of tone was remarkable, and her encore, "The
                        Pomeranian Dog," is catchy and was enthusiastically applauded. Space does
                        not allow of a very full account of the entertainment and several clever
                        turns must necessarily be overlooked, but mention must be made of Mr. H.
                        Herbert, who is the life and soul of the troupe, and who kept tho house in
                        roars of laughter for many minutes with his witty songs and his killingly
                        funny facial contortions. Neither must Mr. Osborne's ventriloquial sketch be
                        passed over without special comment. The dexterity with which he modified
                        and diminished the sound of the voice and carried the art of illusion to the
                        height of perfection, entitles him to be called a prince of ventriloquists.
                        Again, the accompanist, Mr. G. Stamford, proved himself worthy of attention,
                        despite the fact that in his piano solo he scarcely succeeded in altogether
                        mastering the difficulties of an intricate piece, for he humourously
                        illustrated to us how music may be safely pirated and cleverly manipulated
                        so as to form an original operetta. Miss Florence Beech is a charming and
                        most talented actress, who soon gained the sympathy of the audience by her
                        pretty face and graceful movements. </p>
                    <p>One noticeable fact of the evening was that the encores were invariably
                        superior to the advertised turn. The musical portion of the programme was
                        followed by a new series of pictures on the London Bioscope which were
                        extremely interesting, although at times somewhat indistinct. </p>
                    <p>The entertainment is a very enjoyable one, the jokes are fresh and entirely
                        free from any double meaning, a bet which is rare indeed in this country,
                        and, in short, the entire performance is of a high order and is perhaps best
                        described by a remark overheard in the vestibule "It is a white man's show".
                        The standard of excellency attained from a musical point of view is so good
                        that many of Monday night's audience intend to be present at all the
                        subsequent performances, which will be changed each night. </p>
                    <p>Cairo, Tuesday, </p>
                    <p>"The Follies" gave another most excellent performance at the Abbas Theatre
                        last night, on the occasion of their second appearance, before an even more
                        enthusiastic audience than that which assisted at the opening entertainment.
                        The programme, which was entirely changed, was, perhaps, superior to the
                        previous night and the artists, who appeared to have somewhat recovered from
                        the fatigues of their recent travels, were in first rate form and are to be
                        heartily thanked for having furnished us with a really most enjoyable
                        evening. Miss Emilie Tait was again greatly applauded, as was also the
                        pianist Mr. Stamford, who demonstrated his perfect mastery over the keys in
                        a most humourous and interesting manner. Encores were frequent and judging
                        from last night's reception the troupe ought to leave our shores well
                        pleased with the welcome which Egypt has accorded them. </p>

                    <p>SIR.V.CORBETT'S SUCCESSOR</p>
                    <p>Speculating as to the probable successor to Sir Vincent Corbett, "Al Watan"
                        says:- It appears that a vast minority of the Nationalist papers prefer the
                        appointment of Chitty Bey to the post when the present Adviser retires,
                        presumably because that honest and experienced gentleman was known to favour
                        the employment and promotion of individuals of the predominant partner. He
                        is one of the very few Englishmen who are mentioned by the Nationalist
                        papers without acerbity or acrimony. We congratulate Chitty Bey upon this
                        distinction and are with the correspondent of the "Egyptian Gazette" who
                        thinks that he has the best claim for the high position, by virtue of bis
                        former services in the financial departments of the Egyptian Government. But
                        it would be the height of folly to prophecy that Chitty Bey is the next
                        Financial Adviser, as the functions of the post are more diplomatic than
                        financial now that the finances of the country are in the best condition,
                        and that no schemes or special measures are required for meeting deficits or
                        raising new funds. We want no Baring or Goschen now at the Ministry of
                        Finance, thanks to the former workers who have brought our finances to the
                        present state of efficiency almost amounting to perfection. We want a
                        diplomat and a statmesman in the post which is the official link between
                        England and Egypt. The Financial Adviser is practically the deputy and
                        representative of the British Agency before the Egyptian Ministry. He is
                        even numbered among our Ministers, for he is called to meetings and allowed
                        to vote on all questions with them, his vote being considered the wish and
                        the policy of the ruling power. He is at times the British Agency and the
                        Egyptian Government combined inasmuch as he over rules the action of our
                        Cabinet in the name of the British Government. </p>

                    <p>The Belgian Consular Tribunal met yesterday at 5 p.m., under the presidency
                        of the Consul M. Eid assisted by MM. Merzbach and Naus, in order to inquire
                        into the charge against Vittorine Heureux. The evidence of the various
                        witnesses was taken, the most important of which was given by M. Nadel, who
                        gave first aid to the victim, and who heard Vittorine Heureux, cry "He has
                        had what be deserves." Captain Renda said the excited state of the prisoner
                        at the time of arrest, confirmed her words "I am the avenger." Mme Omad at
                        whose house Heureux lodged and worked, said that the prisoner had declared
                        that she had a child whose father was not M. Goldsmith. On the day of the
                        crime she was extremely nervous, and after visiting her son in the hospital
                        had returned in tears, and later on went out, murmuring words of vengeance.
                        She returned at 9 p.m.and wan incoherent in her sleep. </p>
                    <p>The accused said that the chemist at Shoubrah had refused to sell her the
                        vitriol, and that at length she had stolen some. She affirmed her desire for
                        vengeance and contended that her lover had beaten her. </p>
                    <p>Counsel for the defence, M. Eddé, has demanded an inquiry into the mental

                    <p>CRICKET</p>
                    <p>SHIPPING v. BANKS</p>
                    <p>Great interest was taken yesterday by the members of the shipping firms and
                        banks of Alexandria, in the cricket match played on the Alexandria cricket
                        ground between teams representing the respective parties, and the pavilion
                        was well crowded with enthusiastic spectators. The match commenced at 2.30
                        p.m, and the toss being won by Sampson the Banks took first knock. Birch and
                        Inglott went to the wicket first, but Inglott, who played very norvously,
                        soon had his leg stomp displaced by McLean. Inglott shaped well and looked
                        liked getting set, but after three overs he drove a tempter right back to
                        Hobsbaum, who was bowling well on the wicket. Reid had a very short stay
                        with no result, and Roll immediately afterwards fell a victim to a
                        leg-yorker from McLean. Cull, who followed Reid, played very steady and
                        cautions cricket, letting off many balls which should have been punished,
                        but in the long run he and Sampson saved their side from an ignominious
                        defeat. Th^Bfiters <!-- word illegible --> of the opening were unchecked
                        until the ninth wicket had fallen, Richards being run out and Merton, Lucke,
                        Barrow, and Martin falling victims to McLean in quick succession. McLean was
                        bowling splendidly and performed the hat trick with the 7th, 8th, and 9th
                        wickets. When Sampson joined Cull, however, a different complexion was put
                        on the game. Nine wickets had fallen for 29 runs but both player, though
                        taking no advantages, got the mastery over the ball, and brought the total
                        up to 112 before Sampson's off stump was displaced by Wellings. Cull's 56
                        not out was undoubtedly the feature the innings and included 12 boundaries.
                        McLean took 5 wickets for 30 runs, and Hobsbaum 2 for 12, and though
                        Spurgeon took no wickets as a change bowler he kept a good length and kept
                        runs down, but Richley's three overs proved very expensive. </p>
                    <p>The Shipping team opened very well. Perkins and Harkness immediately got to
                        work, the latterly driving the hall to the boundary frequently, while the
                        former, playing, quietly, made single after single. Both players made the
                        bowling look very simple and 46 was registered before Harkness drove his
                        ball into Birch's hand. Moss then partnered Perkins and immediately took
                        liberties with the bowling, the secend ball which he received being driven
                        straight to the off boundary. With the score at 66 Perkins was out l.b.w. to
                        Sampson, but Wallace, who followed, continued to keep things merry with Moss
                        until the latter's middle stump was displaced by Sampson with the total at
                        77. Mclean only stopped for one lusty drive to the on boundary and then
                        Wellings kept his end up while Wallace knocked the ball about. The 5th
                        wicket put on 27 but the next only added three, for Merton was put on to
                        bowl underhand lobs and immediately caused a rot, taking 5 wickets for 3
                        runs, Sampson took 4 wickets for 36 runs. Birch 1 for 33, and Roll 0 for 37. </p>
                    <p>In their second innings the Banks fared very badly, McLean proving deadly.
                        Two wickets fell before a run had been scored, Birch's middle stump being
                        knocked out of the ground by McLean's first delivery, and the wickets fell
                        in quick succession. Stumps were drawn at half past six with nine wickets
                        down and only 43 runs on the board. McLean came out the with splendid
                        analysis of 7 overs, 3 maidens, 9 runs, 8 wickets, and Wellings took 1
                        wicket for 10 runs. </p>
                    <p>Mr. H. Moss was "at home" during the afternoon, tea and light refreshments
                        were served, and the match was greatly enjoytd by both players and
                        spectators. </p>

                    <p>Le marché a ouvert ce matin ferme et animé. Toute la seance a d'ailleurs été
                        remarquablement tenue, excepté vers la fin on une légère réaction s'est
                        produite à la suite d'offres de vente provenant du Caire. En définitive
                        l'ensemble de la cote est en hausse comme hier, mais comme hier aussi les
                        affaires n'ont pas été nombreuses. Il n'y a pas de vendeurs et l'on comprend
                        que dans de telles circonstances les acheteurs ont beau jeu pour pousser les
                        cours à peu de frais. </p>
                    <p>En valeurs dirigeantes lé calme prédomine. A part l'Agricole quia donné lieu
                        a quelques transactions, les autres n'ont guère été échangée. L'Agricole
                        s'avance de 8 1/16 à 8 1/8 vendeurs, la National Bank de 19 7/8 à 20, tandis
                        que la Daïra est plus faible à 12 7/8 vendeurs et que la Delta Light revient
                        de 9 15/16 à 9 7/8 et l'Obligation Crédit Foncier de 304 à 303 l'ancienne et
                        de 262 à. 261 vendeurs la nouvelle. L'Agricole et la National Bank, d'abord
                        l'objet d'une demande suivie du Caire, ont été ensuite offertes en clôture. </p>
                    <p>On a beaucoup remarqué des achats en Land Bank dont le cours progresse de ce
                        fait de 7 3/16 à 7 1/4. La demande provient de Paris. </p>
                    <p>La demande en Tramways d'Alexandrie, particulièrement en Dividendes, a
                        occasionné une nouvelle reprise sur les cours qui s'avancent de 139 1/2 a
                        142 1/2 les Privilégiées et de 292 a 300 les Dividendes. </p>
                    <p>Cette recherche par les marchés étrangers de certaines de nos valeurs entre
                        évidemment en ligne de compte pour l'amélioration constante de notre place
                        depuis une quinzaine de jours. </p>
                    <p>D'autres valeurs profitent du mouvement: la Cassa di Sconto bénéficie de 5
                        fr. à 38, la Banque d'Athènes de 1 fr. a 111 1/2, la Deferred Delta de 1/4
                        de livre à 9 1/2, ainsi que les Nungovich à 13 1/4, le Comptoir de 3/16
                        l'action à 2 13/16 l'ancienne et 2 3/4 la nouvelle et de 1/4 de livre la
                        part de fondateur a 3, le Crédit Franco-Egyptien de 1/16 à 4 1/8, la Banque
                        d'Orient de 4 fr. à 118 1/2. </p>
                    <p>L'Alexandria Water fléchit, au contraire, de 11 1/2 à 11 7/16, et l'Urbaine
                        de 3 11/16 à 3 5,8. </p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, la Salt and Soda s'élève de 17/3 a 17/9, les Ritz
                        de 11/16 à 3/4, la Delta Land de 1 3/4 à 1 13/16, et 'a fondateur Allotment
                        de 70 a 50 P.T., tandis que les Cotton Mills faiblissent de 2/6 a 2/, les
                        Sucreries de 35 à 30, et l'Ordinary Khédivial Mail de 22 à 21/9. </p>
                    <p>Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de chan gements a signaler. </p>
                    <p>On dit qu'une assez importante maison de courtage et reports du Caire serait
                        sur le point de déposer son bilan. Une maison de courtage d'Alexandrie est
                        également aux prises avec de sérieuses difficultés. </p>
                    <p>C'est demain que doit avoir lieu le règlement des transactions en Bourse and
                        Banking. On est généralement d'avis que les principaux intéressés dans
                        l'affaire n'ayant pas donné leur consentement à la décision de
                        l'association, le règlement n'aura pas lieu. On se trouvera dans ce cas an
                        même point ou l'on en était avant la décision. </p>

                    <p>A Paris, le-Crédit Foncier Egyptien a baissé hier de 4 francs à 682. La

                    <p>Ici, les quelques jours de repos que viept de prendre notre marché lui ont
                        profité, car l'animation déjà fort réjouissante la semaine dernière, a
                        continué aujourd'hui de plus belle ; aussi la cote présente-t-elle une
                        hausse quasi générale sur les valeurs traitées. La confiance un moment
                        ébranlée, parait actuellement tout à fait revenue et l'activité se porte de
                        préférence sur les valeurs locales foncières et immobilières. Les titras des
                        grandee Banques qui, il y a quelques semaines encore, avaient seuls un
                        marché suivi, bien qu'améliorant encore leur position, restent un peu dans
                        l'ombre au profit de valeurs moins lourdes et susceptibles de plus-values
                        considérables eu égard à leur bas prix. </p>
                    <p>Le projet de rétablissement du marché à terme a exercé aussi une très
                        heureuse influence en ce sens qu'on en attend de bons résultats en faveur de

                    <p>Dans le compartiment des Banques, l'Agricole reste ferme à 8 1/16. La

                    <p>Le Crédit Foncier se maintient sans affaires a 687 francs. Les obligations
                        anciennes reculent à 302. L'Allotment réagit légèrement a 2 1/4-5/16 et la
                        fondateur avance à P.T. 60. Les Entreprises Immobilières et Travaux

                    <p>Plusieurs de nos lecteurs européens nous ayant demandé si les recentes
                        faillites survenues en Egypte avaient réellement atteint le chiffre de trois
                        millions de livres sterling, comme certains organes de Paris l'ont annoncé,
                        nous saisissons l'occasion de remettre les choses au point.</p>
                    <p>Ainsi qoe la reprise des valeurs égyptienne" à Londres et fi Paris l'a
                        montré, reprise suivie de stabilité, le marché égyptien n'a jamais été aussi
                        atteint que des correspondante effrayés ont bien voulu /'écrire en Europe.
                        La vérité se résume en offque la orise égyptienne a été pro- voquée par un
                        resserrement. de OTédit qui a forcé quelques spéculateurs fi réaliser leur
                        por- tefeuille. Il s'en est suivi de nouvelles baisses qui ont obligé les
                        détenteurs de titras, trop foibles pour les soutenir, fi les vendre. Cela,
                        et la pénurie monétaire régnante ont amené ia gène dont l'Egypte est
                        actuellement en voie de se libérer. Quant aux défaillances autour desquelles
                        ont a mené grand bruit, elles n'ont en que très peu d'influence sur le
                        marché boursier. Elles ont été uniquement provoquées par le brusque retrait

                            <p>The commander of the "Galilée" demanded and obtained permission to
                                disembark troops to guard the Frenoh Consulate. On landing a number
                                of Moors attacked the troops, wounding seven. The French then
                                charged with the bayonet killing a number of the Moors. At the same
                                time the "Galilé" and "Du Chayla" bombarded the town, their fire
                                being, most efficacious. Some Spaniards took part in the combat. The

                    <byline>BY JOSEPH OFFORD</byline>
                    <p>A few years ago an ancient document of first rate importance for the history
                        of Christianity in Egypt was discovered, and receivod far less notice than
                        it deserved. This was the "Prayer Book of Bishop Sarapion" which may be
                        termed an Egyptian Pontifical dating from the fourth century. The author is
                        a well known personage, for this Sarapion was Bishop of Thmuis, a city of
                        Lower Egypt, in the Delta near Lake Monzaleb. The site of its ruins is now
                        known as Tmey-el-Amdid, about five miles east of the railway between Mansura
                        and Abu-Kebir. The town was not far from Mendes, the chief seat, of the goat
                        god of the old Egyptians, and the name Thmuis is thought to have been
                        derived from Thmu, the male goat.* This Sarapion was a valued friend of
                        two.preeminent Egyptian Ecclesiastics, Athanasius and Antony, the latter of
                        whom bequeathed a cloak to Sarapion on his death bed. The recovery of this
                        manuscript containing the lost work of Sarapion was not so much noticed in
                        Egypt because it was not found there but in a monastery in Greece. The date
                        of the writing of the treatise is somewhere between A.D. 350 and 358. It is
                        not the only book we possess by its author, there being extant a treatise by
                        him against the Manicheans, and several epistles. </p>
                    <p>He was, however, chiefly famous as being the recipient of five very valuable
                        letters, from a theological point of view, addressed to him by Athanasius.
                        The number of prayers in this series by Sarapion is thirty, and they are not
                        intended, apparently, for use by the laity or congregation but by the
                        minister. A curious occurrence in them is to be found in the application of
                        a number of titles to the Divinity which appear to be founded upon similar
                        concepts to those which are embodied in the eulogistic names given to the
                        Ptolenmic monarchs, such as filantropos ; filoptocos ; everghetis ; and
                        filantropia. </p>
                    <p>One of the Sarapion prayers is a petition for rain, and a similar one is to
                        be found in the old Coptic Jacobite Church service. Thmuis, being in the
                        Delta, lay within the region of the rains which there, in winter, are borne
                        over the land by the northern wind off the Mediterranean, the mean rainfall
                        at Alexandria being about eight inches. This is not the place to enter into
                        any discussion of the theological tenets of the treatise, but one or two
                        points of general interest may be referred to. For in- stance in Dr. G.
                        Wordsworth's edition of Sarapion he points out that the well known phrase as
                        to renouncing Satan and his ''pomps'' and vanities originated in the phrase
                        of the very early renunciation which was repeated by converts, and which is
                        first recorded in the "Canons of Hippolytus," in which they promised to
                        renounce Satan and his "pompa" or followers (cortege). Mr. Salomon Reinach
                        detected this fact about the same time as Dr. Wordsworth in reference to a
                        passage in Tertullian, giving the correct meaning of "pompa." Among the
                        ecclesiastics who appear in the hierarchy in this manuscript are
                        "Interpreters", a necessary class of persons to render any Greek
                        pronouncements into Coptic or vice versa. In a very early account of a visit
                        to the Holy Land known as the "Perigrinatio Silviae" it is said that at
                        Jerusalem the Interpreter always stood by the Bishop to interpret his
                        allocations into Syriac, and at least one eminent Syriac ecclesiastic is
                        known as "Theodore the Interpreter." To anyone closely acquainted with
                        ancient Egyptian literature the 18th prayer has a very Egyptian character
                        about it. It is termed "Prayer for one who is dead and about to be carried
                        forth" ; it alludes to God as the "God of the spirits", also to the Gates of
                        Hades in the plural, reminding one of the old Egyptian "Book of Gates" or
                        "Book of Pylons" in the nether world. It also promises a resting place to
                        the spirit "in green places" and in chambers, very similar to the formulae
                        of the "Book of the Ani-Tuat" and especially alludes to the "going forth of
                        the soul", which is very like the "going forth" or "coming forth" of the
                        "Book of the Dead." </p>
                    <p>These may be mere coincidences, but the certainty of the derivation from old
                        Egyptian sources of much of the description of the inferno in the
                        recently-found "Apocalypse of Peter" renders it probable that we have here
                        from Sarapion ideas which were originally in the ancient Egyptian theology. </p>

                    <head>THE YEMEN TROUBLE</head>
                    <p>The special correspondent of the "Times" at Beyrout sends an important
                        message, dated July, 11th., to that journal describing the present serious
                        condition of affairs in the Yemen, of the increasing difficulties which the
                        Turkish Commander has to face. </p>
                    <p>That the military situation in Yemen is unsatisfactory appears clearly he
                        says, by the fact that the most optimistic letters which have reached
                        Damascus from the front during the past week merely express the belief that
                        Faizi Pasha and his force will be able to hold Sanaa till the arrival of the
                        reinforcements which were so insistently demanded by the commander of the
                        Yemen Field Force The idea that the appearance of these reinforcements on
                        the scene of action can have any permanent effect on the issue of the
                        campaign is scouted in Syria, where it is believed that the Imam Yahya will,
                        at most retire before the new forces into the mountains and thence conduct a
                        harassing guerilla campaign till the inevitable wastage of the Turkish
                        armies enables him to take the field with a better chance of success
                        Moreover, it is improbable that the Turkish forces, as at present organized
                        and equipped, can ever force their more mobile opponents to action in the
                        open, while the rebels in their own mountains are now considered to be
                        tactically equal, if not superior, to the Turks. The utter inefficiency of
                        the coast blockade, or rather watch, conducted by a few superannuated
                        gunboats and Customs craft enables the contraband trade in arms and
                        ammunition between Yemen and Massawah, Jibuti, and other ports on the west
                        coast of the Red Sea to be carried on with the minimum of risk. Many
                        thousand rifles and large quantities of ammunition have been captured during
                        the campaign, and the shooting of the insurgents is said to be far more
                        accurate than that of the majority of the Turkish troops, whose musketry
                        training, as a rule, begins and ends with manual exercises in the handling
                        of an empty rifle. </p>
                    <p>The deficiency in the ammunition supply, which has caused Faizi Pasha great
                        anxiety, is now being remedied by large indents on the reserve ammunition of
                        the First (Constantinople) and second (Adrianople) Army Corps, but the
                        disorganization of the transport, the utter breakdown of the under staffed
                        and ill-equipped medical service, and the indifferent moral both of officers
                        and men militate far more seriously against Faizi Pasha's chances than the
                        notorious weakness of his troops in tactics and musketry. There are still
                        numerous Syrian Moslems among the troops in Yemen, whose presence
                        constitutes an element of weakness, though the Syrian soldiers showed
                        remarkable powers of endurance during the siege of Sanaa in 1905. They are
                        accused by the Turkish officers of sympathizing with and even of giving
                        information to the rebels, and these accusations would seem to be
                        well-founded as far the last six months scarcely any Syrian reservists or
                        recruits have been called to the colours for service in Yemen. Outbreaks
                        among the troops on the transports bound to and from Hodeida are becoming a
                        regular feature of the journeys of these overcrowded and insanitary vessels.
                        Thus, on July 4, the transport Marmara arrived here from Hodeida with 2,300
                        time-expired Syrian and Turkish soldiers on board. On the arrival of the
                        transport Rear- Admiral Fayek Pasha ordered her captain to remain outside
                        the harbour and to inform the troops that their arrears of jury, amounting
                        to £T32,000, would be paid very shortly, and that they must, therefore, make
                        no demonstration. The troops, however, insisted on the Marmara being brought
                        into port, and on the following day landed en masse and made a noisy
                        demonstration before the Defterdar's house, with the result that the arrears
                        due to them were paid, £T25,000 in cash and the balance in "sanads" (orders
                        on the provincial treasuries for the remission of taxes). Still more serious
                        is the attitude of many of the officers at the front. Several very
                        discreditable surrenders have taken place, and there is no doubt that a
                        number of the officers of the Sanaa garrison mutinied early in June, seized
                        the telegraph office, and telegraphed their complaints to Constantinople,
                        threatening to surrender or abandon their posts unless their grievances were
                        speedily remedied. </p>
                    <p>Indeed, it is difficult not to believe that the insurgents could have driven
                        the Turkish forces to the coast six months ago, but for the mutual
                        suspicions and jealousies of their leaders, and it is just this inability on
                        the part of the Arabs, settled or nomad, to combine against the unpopular
                        rule of the Turk that has prevented any extension of the rebellion beyond
                        the Yemen province and the southern districts of Azir. The Hedjazis openly
                        grumble at the approach of the railway, which will shorten the Syrian
                        pilgrimage and injure the hosts of camel owners, traders, and others, who
                        batten on the much-enduring Hadji, but as yet show no signs of supporting
                        the heretical Zaidis of Yemen, whose Imam has claimed equality with the
                        Sherif of Mecca. In Nejd, the warfare of the kites and crows, Ibn Saud
                        against Ibn Rashid, continues without decisive result. Aided by a cousin and
                        two brothers, Sultan Ibn Rashid in no wise departed from the traditions of
                        his house when he treacherously slew his cousin the Emir Mut'ib and three of
                        his kinsmen some eight months ago and proclaimed himself Emir of Hail. Abd
                        el Aziz ibn Saud, Emir of Riadh, who had made truce with Mut'ib, forthwith
                        vowed vengeance, and waged war in the desultory Bednin fashion against the
                        usurper, defeated Sultan ibn Rashid's forces, and was himself surprised and
                        all but captured in a night attack which stampeded his undisciplined levies.
                        The fears of a Wahabi attack expressed by the Turkish authorities at Medina
                        have now been dissipated. Haindu <!-- word illegible -->ibu Rashid, uncle of
                        the usurping Sultan, a strong Wahabi, has, doubtless with good reason
                        foreworn the neighbourhood of his dangerous nephew and repaired to Medina
                        with his followers, and though many Wahabis from the various districts of
                        Nejd have entered the holy city, their object has been to pay their respects
                        to an influential and religious chief who openly professes neutrality. Thus
                        far, in the long struggle of the houses, fortune has, on the whole, favoured
                        the Beni Saud, but will this be the case when the Hejaz railway has reached
                        Medain Salih, and the Turks, who have generally supported the Emir of Hail,
                        are in a position to intervene effectively on his behalf
                        t<!-- unknown symbol --> The Yemen war may last for years, but there seems
                        to be little risk of any great combination of the Arabs of Northern and

                    <head>PALESTINE EXPLORATION FUND.</head>
                    <p>In the fourteenth quarterly report on the excavation of Gezer, Mr. Stewart
                        Macalister, MA., F.S.A., says- </p>
                    <p>Early in November of last year I landed in Palestine, and almost immediately
                        proceeded to Constantinople to inquire into the progress of the negotiations
                        for the new permit for the resumption of work at Gezer. While in
                        Constantinople, I had opportunities of attempting to extend an interest in
                        the work of the Fund, by lecturing at Robert College, and at the American
                        College for Girls at Scutari. I have to express my acknowledgments of the
                        friendly courtesy with which their Excellencies Hamdy and Khalil Bey
                        received me in the magnificent museum under their control. I must also
                        acknowledge the interest of the officials of his Majesty's Embassy,
                        especially, Mr. Fitzmaurice, who was in charge of the negotiations. Last,
                        but not least, I have to render my cordial thanks to the Fund's staunch
                        friend Mr. Edwin Pears, for much help and kindness. </p>
                    <p>After finishing business in Constantinople I returned to Jerusalem, and a few
                        days later set off for Safed- a diary of my visit there was contributed to
                        the last Quarterly Statement. (1) </p>
                    <p>Towards the end of February I heard that the permit was shortly to be issued.
                        Soon afterwards it was actually in my hands. A week or two had to be spent
                        in necessary preparations and certain official routine, but as soon as
                        possible I made my way to the mound. I am happy to report that I found it
                        exactly as I left it, no harm having come to any of the buildings that were
                        left open at the close of the previous permit. This is to a large extent due
                        to Mr. Murad's friendly care and interest. It is a matter for satisfaction
                        that Surraya Efiendi Al-Khalidi, who during the previous peimit showed
                        himself ready to further the interests of the Fund in every way possible,
                        consistently with a scrupulous performance of his own duties as Commissioner
                        of the Ottoman Government, has been re-appointed to the same office. </p>
                    <p>The actual work of excavation began March 18th, and, except for a couple of
                        days at Easter, has been continued uninterruptedly. The weather has been
                        propitious, although hot south and east winds have been prevalent and on
                        some days made exertion not a little laborious. I have this time made a new
                        departure, and built a hut to take the place of the tents in which the
                        excavating party was formerly domiciled. On all grounds-comfort, economy,
                        stability, and security-the change has been found an improvement </p>
                    <p>It may be remembered that just at the close of the previous permit three
                        remarkable tombs were found, which for various reasons I suggested might
                        possibly be referable to the Philistines. I hoped that these might prove to
                        be the outlying tombs of a cemetery, which, if it were actually Philistine,
                        could not fail to afford results of the highest importance. The ground
                        north, south and east of these tombs was left uncut at the end of the
                        permit. I immediately commenced at this promising spot, and ran a trench
                        north of the tombs to the border of the mound : nothing, however, was found
                        in that direction. A pit was then dug to the south of these, and two more
                        tombs of the series were there found. Excavations are now proceeding to the
                        east, but at the moment of writing the level of the graves has not been
                        reached. - One pit has also been dug on the Eastern Hill. </p>
                    <p>As usual, in looking for one thing, another has been discovered. The trench
                        cut northward from the tombs was found to contain an interesting foundation,
                        apparently that of a Canaanite palace or fortress. Beneath it was another of
                        the very early caves which have been such a notable feature of tho mound of
                        Gezer. The most interesting "find" from the Eastern Hill has been a small
                        stone altar. </p>
                    <p>On the whole, however, the objects discovered during the last two months have
                        been of an "average" character. </p>
                    <p>(1) This contribution was shortened to reduce it to the availible space, and

                    <head>THE SOAP COMBINE.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes :- </p>
                    <p>The outburst of joy evinced by the English press at the awards in the libel
                        actions brought by Lever Brothers and Watson &amp; Sons against the "Daily
                        Mail" is almost indecent in its unrestraint and passes the bounds of
                        righteous indignation. </p>
                    <p>The motive which induced the chief proprietor of the paper to undertake the
                        campaign against the alleged soap trust last autumn is not easily explained.
                        It was probably a mixed one. </p>
                    <p>The various firms forming the soap combine wished to economise in their
                        advertising departments which, through increasing competition, entailed an
                        enormous expenditure. They also wished to be in a position to purchase raw
                        material more cheaply, and it is now alleged that fear of losing these
                        valuble advertisements for the various publication the Associated Press
                        decided Lord Northcliffe in attacking the combine. It is also stated that
                        Lord Northcliffe combated the very methods in the soap combine which he has
                        personally introduced into journalism. He succeeded in breaking the combine
                        but in so doing he resorted to statements which were libellous and he has
                        been called upon to pay the penalty, which is as it should be. No one
                        however has given him credit for a disinterested motive, a desire to
                        safeguard the public!</p>
                    <p>The "Daily Mail" has during its career, as its circulation will show,
                        seriously affected the sale of the morning papers sold at double the price
                        and these papers naturally seize on this opportunity to discredit their
                        rival before the public. Therefore in answer to their allegation concerning
                        the motives which inspired Lord Northcliffe in his campaign against the soap
                        trust, one would ask "Since when is Saul also among the prophets!</p>
                    <p>The people who have the leisure in which to wade through a morning paper such
                        as the "Times" or the ''Daily Telegraph" are in the minority and the "Daily
                        Mail" supplied a long felt want. One need not necessarily assume that people
                        of intelligence form their political views on the lines advocated by that
                        journal.</p>
                    <p>Many ot those pre-eminent in the field of science and literature have
                        contributed articles to the "Daily Mail" and, while one regrets the strain
                        of yellow journalism which, through its news columns, it has introduced into
                        England, one takes the perfervid outburst of Its rivals on this occasion,
                        with the proverbial pinch of salt.</p>

                    <head>NATIONALISTS</head>
                    <p>It is no doubt fellow-feeling says the "Globe" which has made certain of the
                        Irish Nationalist politicians display so great an interest in the movements
                        of the Indian agitators. It is all one to them if they embarrass the
                        Government of the Empire in England or Asia, or, as they proved last year in
                        discussing the Denshawi outrages, in Egypt, and a few years ago, in South
                        Afriea. All is grist that comes to their mill. And similarly, it is not
                        surprising that the disloyal section of the Indian vernacular Press keeps
                        itself and his readers well informed as to the program of the Sinn Fein
                        League in Ireland, and identifies the aims of the latter with the Swadeshi
                        and the boycott in Bengal. The seditions have a keen eye for their friends
                        all over the world, and they realise that an unacknowledged alliance more
                        than doubles their power. But the exposure of such tactics ought to
                        undeceive some of those Radical sympathisers in this country as to the real
                        character of the people with whom they are half-inclined to express
                        sympathy. Unless they wish Ireland to be ruled by a tyrannical association
                        of men who use, a preposterous sham Gaelic propaganda to impotence has so
                        often been proved through its subjugation by the wild tribe of the
                        Himalayas, they will cease to give a passive support to sedition, from
                        whatever quarter it may come. It is one thing to recognise legitimate
                        grievances: it is very different when such grievances are manufactured for
                        ulterior aims. </p>

                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
