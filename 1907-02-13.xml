                    <head>EGYPTIAN BANKS' PROSPERTY.</head>
                    <p>In an interesting article dealing with Anglo-foreign banking enterprises, the
                        "Financier" draws attention to the extent to which the Egyptian banks have
                        benefited by the increased prosperity of this country.</p>
                    <p>In the announcement of the past year's working of the Bank of Egypt no
                        variation is shown (says the writer) on the previous year's dividend, but
                        that year showed a considerable advance on the preceding period, and this
                        progressiveness extends back for several years. Dating from 1901, when 30s.
                        per share, or 12 per cent., was distributed, the following year's
                        distribution was increased to 32s. 6d. per share; in the next year and to
                        45s. in the suceeding, as in the year just closed, or equivalent to 18 per
                        cent. This amounts to an increase of 6 per cent in four years and reflects
                        the great advance that has been made in the Land of Pharaohs during this
                        time. The shares have fully responded to this increase in dividends, as will
                        be seen from the following movements:-</p>
                    <!-- No Template -->
                    <p>At the present price of 38 these shares, it will be observed, have nearly
                        doubled themselves in value, and give a yield of £5 18s. 3d. per cent.</p>
                    <p>The National Bank of Egypt has participated in the increasing prosperity of
                        Egypt to an extent that evokes lively interest in the forthcoming
                        declaration of the year's profits. For 1901 the dividend amounted to 11s.
                        per share on the £10 shares, which had increased 10 16s. a year ago, or,
                        expressed in percentage, the dividend increased from 5 1/2 to 8 per cent.,
                        making the present position one of great expectations. The shares of this
                        bank, as a consequence of the steadily-increasing dividend and the
                        prosperity of the company, have experienced a very pronounced rise in the
                        past few years, as the subjoined figures show:-</p>
                    <!-- No Template -->
                    <p>The most remarkable rise in the above movements is that in the years 1903-4,
                        although that was the period in whic hthere was no increase in the divided,
                        but it was the time when everything Egyptians was expanding. Since then the
                        movements have been less pronouncedk and the present price is the same as
                        the highest levels of the two preceeding yeares shown above. As a
                        consequence of this rise in the market price of the shares the yield, taking
                        the middle figure of current quotations, and on the basis of the last
                        dividend, is only £2 16s. per cent.</p>
                    <p>The Anglo-Egyptian Bank, whose fiscal year terminates at a different period
                        of the year, showed in its last dividend that is was experiencing the
                        benefits of the expanding trade of the country, the last half yearly
                        dividend being at the rate of 20 per cent., per annum, which compares with
                        10 per cent. in 1903. The current quotation of the shares is 13 1/2-14. Ath
                        the middle figure, and at the rate of 15 per cent. for the last completed
                        year, the yield amounts to £5 9s. per cent.</p>

                            <p>Their Majesties opened Parliament in fall State.</p>
                            <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS-Mr. Balfour said that the Government was apparently
                                in distress about the Lords. The views advanced by the different
                                Minister were absolutely inconsistent.</p>
                            <p>The idea that the modification of the House of Lords would prevent an
                                occasional interference with the views of the House of Commons was
                                preposterous. He agreed that in the long run the people should
                                decide what laws should be.</p>
                            <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman said they must avoid a labyrinth of
                                constitutional fallacies and pedantries and remember that the
                                constitution was essentially representative. Anyhow, a solution must
                                be found: the present situation was dangerous and demoralising. He
                                had set aside various scheme which had been suggested with regard to
                                the reconstitution of the Lords. What they were concerned with was
                                the relations between the two Houses and it was to that that the
                                attention of the House would be directed in due course.</p>
                            <p>Sir H. Combei Bonneman, interrupting Mr. Balfour, objected to the
                                assumption that his expression "a measure leading to a larger
                                policy" meant an independent Parliament in Dublin. Reverting to the
                                subject later he said it would not affect the solidarity of the
                                Empire if the Irish people had what every self-governing colony
                                possessed, namely, power to manage their own affairs. That was the
                                larger policy of which he had spoken. (R)</p>

                    <head>THE RUSSIAN AFFAIR.</head>
                    <p>FRENCH CONSUL'S ACTION.</p>
                    <p>The action of M. Girard, French Consul-General at Alexandria, in holding an
                        enquiry on M.Raoul Canivet at the request of the Egyptian Government and the
                        Russian consular authorities, is evoking some journalistic criticism. M.
                        Raymond Colrat, the Editor of "L Egypte," in a leading article on the case
                        of M. Canivet in yesterday's issue of that newspaper, indulges in a violent
                        attack on M. Girard for having agreed to hold an enquiry. M. Colrat exclaims
                        :-</p>
                    <p>To-day acting towardss French journalists just as though they were serfs of
                        the epoch of the Middle Ages, the Consul considers that it is his duty to
                        pursue one of his fellow-countrymen in contempt of the most sacred rights of
                        the Press. Yet has this French subject committed such a stupendous fault? He
                        merely published a piece of inexact information. In that case we ought all
                        to pass throngh the Caudine Forks of the Consul for who of us has not heen
                        mistaken?" Such procedure savours of the Russian régime. It is the system of
                        "Caviar," and nothing more nor less, just the same thing as goes on on the
                        banks of the Neva! Is this to be imposed on us here? Are we to go back a
                        century? To think that it France that will be the first to give such sample
                        of intolerance and of contempt for the right of mankind!</p>
                    <p>SYMPATHY WITH M. CANIVET. </p>
                    <p>In today's issue M. Colrat remarks a propos of M. Canivet:</p>
                    <p>Mon pauvre confrère, je plains votre vieux ménage, mais j'admire votre
                        sereine fidélite. Votre sort, dites vous, n'a rien d'extraordinaire! Il est
                        vrai que vous connaissez l'injustice des hommes et pour l'avoir connu vous
                        êtes devenu philosophe.</p>
                    <p>Le Ministre des Affaires Etrangères français est un ancien journaliste.
                        Laissera t-il touchera ux droits de la Presse? Je sais bien que certains
                        chuchottent que de vieilles rancunes pourraient l'excciter à se taire. Mais
                        ce sont des allégations qui ne tiennent pas debout. Tous ceux qui
                        connaissent M. Pichon le savent incapable de commettre une acte qui lui soit
                        dicté par autre chose que sa conscience.</p>
                    <p>Ce n'est du reste pas M. Canivet qui est poursuivi; c'est l'idée en marche,

                    <head>THE GHEZIREH BALL.</head>
                    <p>By 10 o'clock last night, Ghezireh Palace Hotel was crowded, and every few
                        minutes groups, some in costume, some in ordinary evening dress, left for
                        the Casino, where a constant stream of motors and carriages announced the
                        arrival of ever more goests. Without going into details of costumes and
                        toilettes, we may say at once that the ball has never been more brilliant.
                        All Cairo was there, and the choice of costumes gave infinite credit to the
                        taste and ingenuity of their wearers. Pierrots and pierettes, Arctic
                        explorers and Spanish signorittas, Neapolitan fishermen, Bedouin sheikhs of
                        various tribes, known and unknown syces, at least three versions of the
                        operatic Mephistophales, Sikhs, columbines, were among the masqueraders,
                        while an enormons baby of some six feet in height danced with surprising
                        abandon for one of such tender years. An admirable Toreador and several
                        doctors of various universities, made an interesting colour contrast. There
                        were some charming Pompadour costumes and an extraordinary figure surmounted
                        by a tuft of blonde hair arising from a mask which wore a fixed and nervous
                        smile, which we imagined to represent an extremely simple country maiden. A
                        delightful lily of the valley and an obelisk who must have come from the
                        barem of at least a Sultan were among the most attractive of the
                        masqueraders. Folly, in light blue, was quite bewitching, and a very pretty
                        Mary carried a little lamb. There were some very picturesque European
                        peasant costumes, a Dutch girl, an Italian contadina, and a handsome
                        Tyrolese being the most remarkable. Egyptian dress was well represented by
                        students of Al Azhar and village sheikh while two tall and muscular warriors
                        from the Eastern Sudan were well acquainted with all the niceties of the
                        Hadendowa toilet.</p>
                    <p>The floor of the casino ballroom was delightful, and an excellent supper was
                        greatly appreciated, and at one o'clock the sight in the supper and ballroom
                        was in the highest degree picturesque. Dancing went on vigorously til after
                        three o'clock, when those who remained suddenly realised that morning was
                        coming and conveyances might be difficult to obtain. However the motor
                        omnibus service plied steadily between Ghezireh Palace and Shepheard's
                        Hotel, and we have not heard that any Egyptian warriors or Indian Rajahs
                        incurred the suspicions of the police by tramping back to Cairo from one of
                        the best dances that has ever been given in the Capital.</p>

                        certainly finely staged; the dresses were admirable; the chorus was abundant
                        and appropriate. I would hesitate to accept the verdict of one critic to
                        whom the piece appears as a string of ballads: it seemed rather to be a
                        framework, distinctly Wagnerian, with a suspicioin of Meyerheer in one or
                        two places. There are arias, "La vie est un jardin" (which M Loren sang
                        delightfully). another song in the first art which took curious comic risks,
                        and other passages; but the whole opera seemed to incline to the other
                        extrame. It reminded in a sense of M. Sinadino's "Doga rese," the more so as
                        one is inclined to fear that both these composers promise well but will
                        never fulfil themselves. As to the performance. Mme. Chaix Bonheur's acting
                        was a triumph of study and subtlety. She never exaggerated, never lapsed. It
                        was a fine impersonation. Her voice has some few fine notes. but no charm;
                        so the result was – like the opera itself – a fine framework but little
                        more. M. Moisson (who is certainly not a fort ténor) was evidently tired. He
                        had the right to be, after his voyage. He has a pleasant enough voice, and a
                        good style of acting. M Mézy was for once good, really good. He had some
                        control over his voice (the fine tone and range of which is indisputable)
                        and he made a success of his part. Mlle. Dilloy had very little to do, but
                        as ever she left a perfect impression of delicious sound. Her voice has a
                        certain natural suggestion as of a lark, apart from all things, now
                        peaceful, now almost rapturons. M Loreo sang with great charm; ha has a
                        certain delightful tone and lightness. The orchestra were apparently pleased
                        at their victory over M. Poncet and played fairly correctly, but with no
                        sort of vigour. A fine orchestra, properly led, might have change the whole
                        aspect of "Messaline," and shown all its possibilities. The chorus was quite
                        fair: the sopranos had apparently been reinforced and the male voices weeded
                        out. I missed one worthy tenor whose peculiarly blank expression has ways
                        appealed to me. Their acting in the Saburra scene was exceedingly good. I do
                        not give a resamé of the piece. I only hazard, in conclusion, the impression
                        that remained with me,-a fine presentment of unrealised imagination, which,
                        in the hands of a great composer, would have been a magnificent opera.</p>
                    <p>ABBAS THEATRE.</p>
                    <p>The best part of "Aida" on Saturday night was the march in the 2nd
                        act-thanks, as usual, to Sig. Campanini, who handled the music and orchestra
                        with that keen mastery which should, one day, bring him into real notice. He
                        had a great ovation when the curtain fell from a crowded and enthasiastic
                        house. All the performers sang quite well. "Aida" usually does seem to go
                        well with the average Italian tronpe. Sig. Lucenti was very fine in the last
                        act, and showed the depth and fullness of his voice in condemning Radames,
                        Sig Tschierto showed that he had a fine strong voice for a lyric tenor Sig.
                        D'Andina was hardly up to the King's part : his voice seemed to have no
                        tone. The chorus was quite good, expecially the male voices. They evidently
                        appreciated the reception they had had in "Faust." Surely it is a very very
                        rare thing to hear the Soldier' chorus" encored. One usually has enough of
                        it at one hearing.</p>

                    <head>CRITICISM OF LORD CROMER.</head>
                    <p>Clearly the main object of Mr. Edward Dicey's recently published book "The
                        Eypt of the Future" is to criticise Lord Comer. Among the various charges
                        levelled against the British Representative in Egypt by Mr. Dicey is that of
                        he moral retrogression of Egypt that has, he avers, been made under his
                        lordship's rule! The passage in question deserves quotation as it is an
                        interesting sample of Mr. Edward Dicey's mode of attack :-</p>
                    <p>"It is a commonplace saying that a despotism exercised by a benevolent despot
                        is the best system of government possible in this imperfect world of ours.
                        Egypt under British rule affords to-day a sort of object-lesson both of the
                        merits and demerits of an autocratic administration. Lord Cromer is, I admit
                        most gladly, a highminded and benevolent autocrat. Ismail, however, in the
                        day of his grandeur, was not a more absolute ruler than the present
                        representative of Great Britain on the banks of the Nile. On the other hand,
                        no principles could be more diametrically opposite to one another than those
                        on which Egypt has been administered under an Oriental and a British system
                        of rule. No honest critic can dispate the zeal, the absolute integrity, and
                        the ability with which Lord Cromer rules Egypt. Indeed, the autocracy
                        conferred upon him in virtue of our military oconpation is due in no small
                        degree to the general respect entertained by the Egyptians for his personal
                        character. At the same time, the invariable defects of autocratic rule have
                        made themselves manifest. To put the matter shortly, Egypt-under autocratic.
                        though genuinely benevolent rule-has made enormons material progress, but
                        her moral progress has been of a retrograde description."</p>

                        <p>This morning about 4 o'clock Mr. M. P. Carver and Mr. K. Macaulay, who
                            inhabit a flat close to the Alexandria Cricket Club grounds, were
                            awakened by piercing screams for help which apparently came from the
                            club grounds. They got up and went in search of the distressed person,
                            who continued to utter most heart-rending sounds. They found that these
                            howls came from an Englishman who had fallen from the balcony of the
                            racquet court on to the ground, a distance of about 15 feet. He was
                            quite helpless and unable to move owing to having fallen on his hip. The
                            two gentlemen got a cab and conveyed him to the Sailors and Soldiers'

                    <dateline>LONDON, January 31.</dateline>
                    <p>The Army Rifle Association report for 1906 shows that the 1st Battalion
                        King's Royal Rifle Corps Egypt did well in the intercompany team matches
                        abroad. E,C,F,A,H, and D Companies taking the first plaecs; and G took the
                        ninth place. E Company was awarded the Shield, with a score of 185
                        points.</p>
                    <p>In the coming October, Colonel W.S. Kays, King's Royal Rifle Corps, will
                        vacate the command of the 2nd Battalion, Jubbulpore, under the four years
                        rule. The command in the ordinary course should go to Major Sir F.B.M.
                        Henniker, Bart., the second in command of the 4th Battalion.</p>
                    <p>Before a court-martial, sitting a Cork Barracks yesterday, Squadron,
                        Sergeant-major Moore, 6th Inniskilling Dragoons was charged with dessertion
                        from his regiment, from which he absented himself for nearly twelve months,
                        and with losing, by neglect, clothing and other necessaries. The prisoner
                        pleaded guilty to the charges on the sheet. The documentary evidence adduced
                        went to show that he enlisted in the Inniskilling Dragoons in August, 1864
                        and deserted from them in Dublin in December, 1905, and subsequently
                        surrendered himself to the civil authorities at New York in December,
                        1906.</p>
                    <p>The prisoner, who is aged about 30 years, when asked by the Court if he had
                        any statement to make it mitigation of his punishment, said that previous to
                        his desertion he was laid up in the hospital with a very painful disease;
                        that at the same time he was engaged to be married; and that the conjoint
                        circumstances preyed on his mind to such an extent that he deserted.
                        Continuing, he threw himself entirely on the mercy of the Court, and hoped
                        that they would take into consideration his previous character. He served
                        through the South African war, where he not alone received the war medal but
                        was mentioned in despatched and he was also awarded the Royal Humane
                        Society's Medal for live-saving. He had also been fifty-five days in close
                        confinement, a great part of which term was spent in the regimental
                        cell.</p>
                    <p>The prisoner's statement having been formally affixed to the evidence, he was
                        found guilty on the strength of his own plea and the evidence brought
                        forward, and the sentence of the Court when reviewed or sanctioned, will be
                        published in the orders of his regiment.</p>

                    <p>Captain and Adjutant L.E.G. Oates, 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, Cairo. who has
                        just been promoted to that rank, is the officer who commanded a patrol of
                        the regiment in the sharp fight with the Boers near Aberdeen on the 6th
                        March, 1901. The patrol of the Inniskillins found itself in a very tight
                        corner, and for four hours made a fine stand against the Boers, who were in
                        force. Eventually the patrol got back to Aberdeen without the loss of a
                        rifle, but several were wounded, including Lieutenant Oates, whose thigh was
                        broken by a bullet. Twice, during the fight, Scheepers, the Boer commandant,
                        sent a flag a truce and the summons to surrender, and each occassion the
                        answer was "The Inniskillings came to fight, not to surrender".</p>

                        acting rank of admiral, though in view of the fact that in the future the
                        Mediterranean Fleet is to consist of only six battleships, with, of course,
                        the cruiser squadron attached, it is not improbably that heuceforth the
                        Mediterranean Fleet will be regarded as the appointment of a vice
                        adrmial.</p>
                    <p>When Lord Charles Beresford hoisted his flag as chief in command of the
                        Mediterranean station that fleet was considerably reduced in importance
                        under the reorganisation then effected on the initiative of Sir John Fisher
                        when the balance of British naval power was shifted from the Mediterranean
                        to home waters. There are still some who regard this as false strategy and
                        who contend that we ought to be all powerful in the Mediterranean. It is
                        quite conceivable, in view of the rapid growth of the navy of a certain
                        power, which shall be nameless, that we shall have to fight for our very
                        existence in home waters, therefore it is a matter of vital importance under
                        the existing order of things that we should have the strongest fleet where
                        there is every indication will be the most needed.</p>

                    <p>ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS</p>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes specified in the Memorandum of
                        Association, and in particular to undertake contractcs for the construction
                        of public buildings, private houses and other works, and to exploit the
                        manafacturs of materials for construction and to acquire and carry on any
                        business useful in this connection.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed also to purchase, improve, develop lease and otherwise deal
                        with suburban and town properties when acquired, and to develop, building
                        land by the erection of houses or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>A feature of the business of the Company will be the construction of
                        buildings and houses on credit, the owner being allowed to pay the cost of
                        construction by instalments with interest over an agreed number of
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The present demand for honsee in Alexandria, Cairo and other towns in Egypt
                        is beyond the capacity of existing constructors, and it is considered that
                        there is ample scope for remunerative business for the Company in this
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>The Company will also, as opportunity arises, acquire or finance or assist in
                        financing sound industrial or commercial undertakings, more particularly
                        those whose objects are useful to the general scheme of their
                        undertaking.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In chosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>This depends party upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co's steamers, which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is machto interest the
                        visitor The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a
                        fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all
                        over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
                        interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by
                        Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when
                        Archimedes was slain- his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an
                        ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the
                        capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest is
                        to be found in this fine city The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic orgin and
                        close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Erimiti with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay- Castellamare and Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to
                        Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding county. In Florence itself the chruchs
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promendares and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). — The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                        with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                        cities and a phenomenally equable temperature— warm in winter and
                        deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                        Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble calumns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santa
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern ltaly before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs
                        change trains at Borgo San Dumino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours' journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian

                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
