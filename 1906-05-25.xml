                    <head>LORD CROMER'S SPEECH. </head>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's speech at the laying of the foundation stone of Victoria
                        College yesterday was rendered particularly interesting by his reference to
                        two subjects of remarkable importance both from a general and from a local
                        point of view. Referring to the question of religious teaching his lordship
                        laid particular stress on the necessity of guarding education against the
                        inroads of religious dissension, which, baneful as its effects have been in
                        Europe, would do more than any other hostile agency to block the path of
                        progress in the Nile Valley. Egypt has recently enjoyed a happy immunity
                        from sectarian strife ; and the days when El Hakim persecuted the Copts or
                        when Cyril and his monks butchered Hypatia have left no shadow, and in their
                        social and commercial intercourse the inhabitants of the chief cities of
                        Egypt can teach a lesson to those north Irish towns where Protestant and
                        Catholic quarrel for 364 days of the year and engage in sanguinary encounter
                        on July 14, or to English villages where "chapel-goers" discover to their
                        cost that it is ill to court the disapproval of the quality. May Egypt
                        remain untroubled by the scourge of religious dissension, for in our
                        cosmopolitan population of Moslems, Copts, Greeks, Hebrews, Roman Catholics,
                        and Protestants every element of dissension exists though religious strife
                        is happily rare. For this the caution of the Egyptian Government, the
                        tolerance of the leaders of most of the religions and nationalities here
                        represented, and - we venture to say-the great prosperity of Egypt, are
                        responsible. Injudicious State interference, intolerance on the part of the
                        heads of sects, and poverty—the three chief factors of religious strife—are
                        happily absent.</p>
                    <p>A second and equally important utterance of Lord Cromer refers to the
                        necessity for combination and co-operation between Earopeans and natives and
                        between the Earopeans of various nationalities who form so important and
                        progressive an element in the life of Egypt. We do not wish to recall
                        painful memories of past controversies and disputes-enough that the growing
                        cordiality between the various nationalities represented in Egypt is a happy
                        omen of the country's future. When Frencnmen, Britons, Greeks, Italians, and
                        Germans show that they have the good of their adopted country at heart, and
                        aim at something wider than the mere narrow interest of a small community,
                        one of the great obstacles to progress disappears. Rancour and jealousy have
                        in the past blinded the Europeans of Egypt to the fact that they must sink
                        their differences if they are to carry to a successful conclusion the task
                        of Western civilisation in the Nile Valley, a task unskillfully begun in the
                        early years of last century by an energetic European and Moslem ruler,
                        ineffectively carried on by some of his successors, now hampered by
                        reaction, now by poverty, but never wholly abandoned and now at last blessed
                        with promise. Mutual jealousies retard, matual friendsbips promote the
                        prosperity of Egypt, and if some of us find the ideal too narrow let them
                        remember that wherever men of different nationalities and faiths live and
                        work in harmony for honourable ends, something, however trifling it may
                        seem, has been done for the furtherance of the ideal of the federation of
                        the civilised world.</p>

                        are, but it is stated that discoveries were made among the documents which
                        eliminated all the benevolence from official proceedings, and it is,
                        perhaps, as well for the Bey that he is "outside the jurisdiction." But,
                        besides the documents, there were found coffers stuffed with bank notes and
                        with the securities that constituted in the aggregate a veritable cave of
                        Ali Baba. This wealth has been removed to Yildiz Kiosk - ostensibly to
                        protect the interests of the Bey's children.</p>

                    <head>FLIGHT FROM THE HAREM.</head>
                    <p>Reports from Constantinople state that a perfect epidemic of flights from the
                        harem seems to have broken out there, especially among Turkish women of the
                        upper classes. It will be remembered that a few months ago the two daughters
                        of the general secretary of the Foreign Office ran away to Paris. Soon
                        afterwards the daughter of the murdered Redvan Pasha aIso fled. Now comes
                        news of the flight of the daughter of the Minister of the Interior. Many
                        prominent families see that their daughters will no longer tolerate
                        existence in a harem. Old Turks who remember the Crimean War declare that
                        since then there has never been so many attempted escapes from the harem as
                        at the present time. Then the fair Turks fell in love with French officers
                        and ran after them to Paris.</p>

                            required for the part but, her acting was extremely good and she was
                            well supported by a melodious Don José. Sig. Arrighetti, as Escamillo,
                            was rather disappointing. The choras acted well but its singing was very
                            uneven, 80 mach so as to give the impression of inadequate rehearsals.

                    <head>AN EXCITING SCENE.</head>
                    <p>A Frenchman, living in Ciccolani-street, Alexandria, has recently been
                        somewhat strange in his head. Lately he tried to set fire to his house with
                        petroleum. The landlord and neighbours became alarmed and begged the
                        consular and police authorities to secure the madman and expel him from the
                        house. Yesterday afternoon a delegate of the French Consulate, accompanied
                        by a janissary, went to the house, and a scene of great excitement ensued.
                        The madman with &amp; loaded revolver threatened to kill the delegate and
                        the janissary if they dared to set foot in his house. The local police came
                        to their aid but up to 6.30 o'clock yesterday evening nothing could be
                        effected. The man barricaded himself in and refused to budge, meantime
                        keeping his foes at bay by pointing the nozzle of his revolver through the
                        door. At 7 o'clock &amp; dozen firemen were summoned with the steam fire
                        engine and a reinforcement of twenty police. Some firemon clambered op the
                        house while others smashed the door in with their hatchets. The madman was
                        finally secured from behind and taken to the French Consulate. These
                        proceedings, which lasted from 1 to 8 p.m., aroused extraordinary excitement
                        in the neighbourhood and a crowd of some thousands of persone watched the
                        siege of the Alexandrian Fort Chabrol with the keenest interest. The
                        consular authorities have sealed up the house.</p>
                    <p>The hero of this unfortunate episode is named Bernard. He has been a resident
                        at Alexandria for four years past and he is described as an inventor of
                        chemical products. His means of existence are quite unknown but he used to
                        devote considerable time to chemical experiments which annoyed his
                        reighbours considerably. He spent last night in tbe Government Hospital and
                        this morning the French Consular Secretary and Dr. Legrand were appointed
                        Commissioners in Lunacy to examine and report on his mental condition and to
                        discover whether he is actually mad.</p>

                    <p>Laying the Foundation Stone</p>
                    <p>Speech By Lord Cromer. </p>
                    <p>The laying of the foundation stone of the new Victoria College drew a large
                        and representative gathering to Siouf yesterday afternoon. The ceremony took
                        place in a large tent, which afforded ample accommodation for the hundreds
                        of persons present. The prɔceeding began punctually at 4.30 o'clock. Among
                        the many notables present among the spectators were his Beatitude Photius
                        II., the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, Yacoub Pacha Artir, Under
                        Secretary of State to the Ministry of Public Instruction, the Grand Rabbi of
                        Alexandrie, Mustapha Pacha Ibadi, Governor of Alexandria, Sir Vincent
                        Corbett, Financial Adviser, Mgr. Kyrillos Goba, Greek Catholic Malobite
                        Patriarch of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, the Father Superior of the
                        Jesuits, judges of the Mixed Courts, Sir Massie Blomfield, Baron Jacques de
                        Menasce, president of the Jewish community of Alexandria, M. Michel
                        Sinadino, vice-president of the Hellenic community, the members of the
                        Diplomatic and Consular Corps, Schiess Pasha, vice-president of the
                        Alexandria Municipality, and a large gathering of officials and prominent
                        representatives of the European and native communities. The arrival of Lord
                        and Lady Cromer was greeted by the strains of the National Anthem, and the
                        proceedings began with an address by Mr. E. B. Gould, I. 8. O., British
                        Consul-General at Alexandria, who spoke as follows :</p>
                    <p>"We are gathered to-day to lay the foundation stone of the new Victoria
                        College, and as chairman of the committee, I take this opportunity to
                        express the great gratification we feel at Lord Cromer having consented to
                        perform this. ceremony for us. Our pleasure is very much enhanced by the
                        gracious pre. sence of Lady Cromer. In the name of all present I now tender
                        them our very hearty welcome. I will not on this occasion deal with the
                        history and prospects of the college. These matters will be treated of by
                        subsequent speakers. It will, however, I think, be convenient if I describe
                        briefly the proposed order of the ceremony to-day. First, Baron Jacques de
                        Menasce, as one of the most influential of the original promoters of our
                        school, and as a member of the general and executive committee, will give us
                        a short statement of his views of the progress and prospects of our college.
                        Secondly, Sheikh Mohamed Hamid, the Arabio professor of the college, who has
                        rendered us invaluable service, will pronounce &amp; sbort address in the
                        language of this country. Thirdly, Mr. Preston, the hon. secretary, who has
                        so generously devoted so much of his time to the college, will read, for
                        general information, the scroll which it is proposed to place in the cavity
                        of the foundation stone. He will then submit the scroll to Lord Cromer and |
                        invite him and Lady Cromer to add thereto</p>
                    <p>their signatures. All being thos ready, Mr. | Preston will, on behalf of the
                        committee, ask Lord Cromer to lay the foundation stone. His Lordship will,
                        we trust, before completing the ceremony, favour us with one of those
                        speeches to which we all look for instruction and I guidance. The stone will
                        then be laid and the I proceedings will terminate by &amp; few words from
                        Mr. Lias, the headmaster, to whose remarkable devotion to his difficult and
                        delicate task is due, in the main, the notable success that has thus far
                        attended our enterprise. Baron Menasce said:</p>
                    <p>Milord, Mesdames et Messieurs, </p>
                    <p>La question de l'éducation en commun, qui partout, est un sujet de
                        préoccupation grave pour les familles, était dans ce pays, à une époque
                        récente encore, un problème impossible à résoudre sans de grands sacrifices
                        matériels ou moraux.</p>
                    <p>Confier ses enfants aux établissements religieux, seuls existants alors, et
                        faire ainsi litière de scrupules respectables ; on les envoyer en Europe à
                        grands frais et au prix de cruels déchirements, telles étaient les deux
                        alternatives entre lesquelles on avait à choisir. Et les enfants ainsi
                        élevée, rentraient le plus souvent en étrangers dans le foyer familial, dont
                        il avaient perdu le contact et oublié la douceur</p>
                    <p>Dans une ville d'initiative comme Alex andrie, cette situation n'avait que
                        trop duré et un courant d'opinion finit par se former, en taveur de la
                        création d'une école libre de tonti attache confessionelle. Des réunions
                        furent organisées où l'on discuts les divers systèmes d'éducation. Le
                        système qui fait la part égale entre les exercices de l'esprit et ceux du
                        corps fut unanimement adopté. Des sommes importantes furent souscrites, et,
                        à cette occasion comme en tant d'autres, M. George Alderson nous fit admirer
                        la vertu du silence, et l'éloquence du geste. Un comité international fut
                        élu, comprenant des notabilités de cultes et de nationalités
                        différentes.</p>
                    <p>Sir Charles Cookson, à la mémoire duquel il est de mon devoir, en ce jour, de
                        rendre un hommage ému et reconnaissant, accepta 1 présidence de ce comité
                        dont il fut la cheville ouvrière.</p>
                    <p>Il a en Monsieur Gould un éminent et digne successeur. S'inspirant des
                        traditions de famille de S.A. le Khédive, dont la sollicitude éclairée
                        encourage tout ce qui marque un po dare la voie du progrès et de la
                        civilisation, Gouvernement et la Municipalité concédèrent à prix réduit à
                        l'œuvre naissante, un superbe<cb n="3"/>emplacement qui par la suite devait
                        représenter une fortune.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer lai-même &amp; daigné tenir l'enfant sur les fonts baptismaux, et
                        par une faveur rare, le placer sous l'égide d'un nom illustre, celui de la
                        glorieuse souveraine, dont un grand peuple, à qui nous empruntions son

                    <p>Né sous les plus heureux auspices, filleul d'un homme éminent à tous les

                        tout bas, le Victoria College ne ignora les vicissitudes du jeune âge, et
                        son développement rapide justifia toutes les faveurs, en dépassant toutes
                        les espérances.</p>

                    <p>Sheikh Mohamed Hamed then addressed 1 the gathering in Arabic. The following
                        is a - summary of his speech :</p>
                    <p>The virtues and vices of a nation enter by e the door of education. If
                        instruction be improved and education be suitable to the needs of the
                        people, the results of the two will be a blessing to the country and will
                        produce men 3 that love the truth; who are trustworthy and capable of giving
                        good advice ; men that will be of one mind and have one object in view ;
                        whose memory will live in after days and be remembered in history. But if
                        the contrary, the pillars of the country will fall down. When a boy attains
                        manhood his deeds will be in accordance with what he has learnt as a child.
                        As the thread is woven upon the loom, so will - be the texture of the web.
                        The manners that a child learns are thus interwoven in his nature, and are
                        not merely adornments from without. But earliest impressions are strongest.
                        Therefore there should be a fixed time for a boy's H entering school. In
                        proportion 28 a boy is left to himself so will his character grow strong. We
                        must see, then, that his surroundings are good. We want therefore three
                        things : a fixed time for a boy to enter school; good infigences, and
                        surroundings; perseverance to complete his school course. These are the
                        objects at which we aim in the school of which his Excellency Lord Cromer is
                        just now laying with his own hand the foundation stone; that its foundations
                        may be learning, understanding, and se morality. And I pray that God may
                        help those who are set in authority over us to do that which will bring
                        blessings upon themselves and upon us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. S. Preston then read the text of the scroll placed in the cavity of
                        the stone, which is as follows:-</p>
                    <p>Victoria College is an institution intended by its promoters to provide for
                        the upper classes in Egypt of all nationalities and creeds a school for the
                        education of their sons which would, so far as possible, follow the lines of
                        an English public school. The idea, oliwhich owes its origin to the
                        initiative of ere Sir Charles Cookson, H.B.M.'s Congal-Geon neral in 1897,
                        met at the outset with very considerable support amongst the British
                        community at Alexandria and elsewhere in Egypt, as well as from the leading
                        members of other communities, notably the Greek, Israelite, Syrian, and
                        Mussulman. A large sum of money was raised and early in 1898 Mr. G. B.
                        Alderson presented the college, then known as the British Schools of Egypt,
                        with the site of some 25,000 square pics on which the present college
                        stands. The funds, however, at the disposal of the College Committee did not
                        admit of a commencement, until in January, 1900, Mr. Alderson again
                        generously came forward with the other of the loan of the funds necessary to
                        enable the buildings to be completed. The school building was begun early in
                        1901 and on the 25th April, 1901, the foundation stone of the first college
                        was laid by Lord Cromer. On the 24th May, 1901, at a general meeting of I
                        promoters, the name of the school was changed to "Victoria College” and the
                        scheme adopted as a memorial to her Most Gracious Majesty the late Queen
                        Victoria. The college first opened its doors to pupils on November 1, 1902,
                        under the head mastership of Mr. C. R. Lias, and during the first year the
                        numbers of the school, which at the opening were 25, rose to 45. Since that
                        date the college has been continuously a success and the average number of
                        pupils at the present day is 186. The growing number of pupils has rendered
                        a large college necessary and the great <cb n="4"/> rise in the value of
                        Alexandria land decided the committee to arrange for the sale of the
                        existing site and the purchase of a larger site farther from the town,
                        where, with the funds so made available, a new college could be built. The
                        site of about 17 feddans, on which this foundation stone is being laid, c.
                        was accordingly purchased in February, 1905, and has since been transferred
                        to the college 1 trustees with the friendly intervention of the Egyptian
                        Government. It is hoped to open the new College in October, 1907. It will
                        provide, accommodation for some 350 papile and will admit of being farther
                        extended to accommodate 500 or even more. The present foundation stone is
                        laid to-day the 24th May, 1906, the anniversary of the birthday of the late
                        Queen, by the Rt. Honble. the Earl of Cromer, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., K.C.S.I.,
                        etc., Acl companied by Lady Cromer. Accompanying this are the first three
                        annual reports of the l' head-master and the hon. treasurer containing also
                        lists of the founders, general com-1. mittee, and executive committee of the
                        College. </p>
                    <p>Before asking Lady Cromer to lay the foundation stone Lord Cromer delivered
                        the following speech :-</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gould, Ladies, and Gentlemen,- When the Victoria College was first
                        instituted, some doubts were expressed as to its fatore. It was wisely
                        decided to move tentatively. These doubts have now been removed. The
                        institution may be said to have passed out of the experimental stage. We are
                        assembled here 12 to-day, on the anniversary of the birthday of: our late
                        revered Queen, to lay the foundation stone of a larger and more complete
                        institution than that which formerly existed. This unquestionable success
                        is, I think, mainly due to two causes. In the first place, it is dae to the
                        persistent efforts of the committee, and notably to the generosity of a
                        fellow-countryman who in many directions has conferred great benefits on the
                        town of Alexandria ; I need hardly say that I allude to Mr. Aldersop. The
                        second cause is that, under the impulse given by Mr. Lias, what is probably
                        the best feature of the English public school system has been introduced. In
                        a recent report, Mr. Lias, paraphrasing an expression of that great
                        schoolmaster, Dr. Arnold, said that he wished to make this college "an
                        epitome of the home." Perhaps it would have buen more correct to say, "a
                        reproduction of the home.” This is what is being done. The masters are
                        brought into close and constant contact with the papils ; and I understand
                        that the committee has, very wisely, decided to introduce the system of
                        house-masterships, thus giving the assistant masters a direct and permanent
                        interest in the institution. Two observations of a more general nature occur
                        to me on the present occasion. One is, that I trust that everyone of
                        influence in this country, in his own sphere of action, will do all in his
                        power to prevent the evil spirit of religious dissension from blocking the
                        path of educational progress, so tar, I am happy to say, that spirit has
                        not, in spite of the great diversity of creeds in this country, shown itself
                        to any considerable extent. There are schools where the Koran is taught, and
                        there are schools where instruction is given in the Bible by the various
                        persuasions of Christiane. Religious instruction in this particular college
                        is, as you are aware, not obligatory. It is, however, given at the request
                        of those parents who desire it, by teachers whom they have themselves
                        chosen. Gentlemen, there is plenty of room in Egypt for schools of all these
                        descriptions. I may add that, though I have been frequently urged to move
                        the Egyptian Government to place its educational policy in the matter of
                        religious teaching on a different, and perhaps somewhat more theoretically
                        defensible, basis than that which now existe, I have always held, and still
                        hold, that this is a case where the homely proverb of "leaving well alone”
                        applies with special force. The main consideration, to my mind, is to let
                        education advance -and it is advancing with rapid strides-without stirring
                        the fires of religious strife. </p>
                    <p>The other point which strikes me is, that the composition of this college is
                        a very good representation in miniature of the cosmopolitan society of
                        Egypt. I am informed that, out of a total of 186 papils, 30 are Christians,
                        67 are Israelites, 39 are Moslems ; whilst as regards nationalities, there
                        are Egyptian, Turkish, Syrian, Armenian, Maltese, Greek, English, French,
                        Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Swiss, and Belgian pupils. There are many such
                        schools and colleges in this country. They cannot fail to do good. In the
                        first place, as regards the relations between Earopeans and native Egyptian,
                        I would fain hope that this amalgamation of races may, in process of time,
                        produce some effect in the direction of removing those misunderstandings
                        which, even to a greater extent than any solid differences of opinion, do
                        much to foster racial animosity ; whilst, as regards Europeans inter se, it
                        may be hoped that the more the rising generation of the various
                        nationalities see of each other, the more they will appreciate a fact of
                        which I have for many years been very fally convinced. It is, that the
                        Europeans resident in Egypt - on whom the progress, whether material or
                        moral, of the country so much depends—are bound<cb n="5"/> together by a
                        common interest. I think I notice, during the last two or three years, a
                        distinct diminution of that petty international rivalry and acerbity which,
                        in the past, has done infinite harm. It is my earnest hope that this healthy
                        movement will grow apace, and that all the educated and influential
                        Europeans in this country will fully realize that they stand together as the
                        representatives and champions of western civilization. For this, amongst
                        other reasons, I welcome the establishment of the Victoria College, as an
                        institution worthy of| the great Sovereign whose name it bears. It will, I
                        trust, help in some degree towards the political and social fusion of the
                        various races who inhabit the valley of the Nile, and who, although they are
                        not all Egyptians in the ordinary and technical sense of the term, deserve
                        that title in its wider, and, as I think, truer sense, in that they are all
                        dwellers in Egypt, and all equally interested in the welfare of the country.
                        In my opinion, it is in the direction of facilitating this fusion that the
                        efforts of all true Egyptian reformers should be turned.</p>
                    <p>Lady Cromer, at his Lordship’s request, then proceeded to lay the foundation
                        stone with the usual formalities, and declared it "well and truly laid."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lias, the headmaster, then made the following remarks :</p>
                    <p>My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen.—'The ceremony we have assembled to see is
                        over. The foundation-stone of our new school has been well and truly laid.
                        The principles of the education in which we believe have been stated in
                        words that we shall not easily forget. The lesson which Lord Cromer
                        impresses on us is one that we can all understand. Let mutual goodwill,
                        then, be the watchword of our new school as it has been of the old. If
                        Victoria College during its first four years has prospered even beyond
                        expectation it is not a little because the boys, their parents, the masters
                        and the committee have known how to work together. We are of many
                        nationalities and of different creeds, but may we not justly say that in
                        aims and aspirations we are one? We are all proud of our school. We all wish
                        to make it worthy of the honoured name it bears. Ladies and Gentlemen, We
                        appreciate your kindness in joining us this afternoon, and I am sure that
                        you will associate yourselves with me, when, on behalf of the masters and
                        boys of Victoria College, I offer our sincere thanks to Mr. Gould and the
                        committee for inviting as to this interesting ceremony, and to Lord and Lady
                        Cromer, whose help and presence are so great an honour to our school</p>
                    <p>After three cheers for Lord and Lady Cromer and Mr. G. B. Alderson, there was
                        an adjournment to the buffet. All the arrangements in this respect had been
                        entrusted to Mr. Landader, of the San Stefano Hotel Casino, and it is
                        needless to state that they were excellent.</p>
                    <p>The site of the new school is approached from Rae-el-Akbal between the Palace
                        tramway station and the main road from Alexandria to Siont. The site
                        comprises seventeen feddans and was purchased from the Egyptian Trust and
                        Investment and the Building Lands of Egypt at the rate of fifteen piastres
                        tarif per pic. These two companies possess a million and a half square pics
                        in the immediate neighbourhood and intend to develop considerably this part
                        of Ramleh. Mr. Glymenopoulo has had a station constructed close by, which is
                        called "Victoria College".</p>
                    <p>The tramway arrangements for the conveyance of Lord Cromer and party were
                        very good and redounded greatly to the credit of M. Jacot des Combes.</p>

                    <p>Lord and Lady Cromer spent last night at San Stefano Hotel. This morning they
                        visited the Mohamed Aly Industrial School, where they were received by some
                        of the leading members of the Moslem Benevolent Society of Alexandria (El
                        Orwa el Wuska). Afterwards Lord and Lady Cromer went to the barbour and
                        inspected the new pass and the works in progress. They were accompanied by
                        Admiral Lambton, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, Director General of Ports and
                        Lights, Mr. E. B. Gould, H.B.M's Consul-General, etc. The party proceeded in
                        the Tier el Mina, which was followed by a pilot boat and a steam launch.
                        After inspecting the pass the party went on board the steam launch, in which
                        they proceeded to Mex and afterwards to Gabbary, returning subsequently to
                        the ArseDal landing stage.</p>

                        <p>The report last Friday morning that torpedo boat No. 56 had suffered a
                            doleful disaster spread rapidly through the town. A few hours after the
                            departure of the Astilla a storm of such severity arose as to delay the
                            traffic in the Canal until midday. The news did not surprise those who
                            are acquainted with the dangers of navigating such craft near this coast
                            in rough weather.</p>
                        <p>Torpedo boat No. 64, which, rumour had it, was the missing boat, did not
                            proceed to sea with the others, having gone into dock to have her
                            machinery overhauled. She is now in fighting trim again and will shortly
                            rejoin her fellows at Malta.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COMPANIES. <lb/> FOUNDERS' SHARES.</head>
                    <p>The attitude of the Egyptian Government towards limited liability companies
                        formed in Egypt is to become more paternal, as the State Legal Department
                        has been much exercised of late over the alleged abuse of founders' shares
                        in some recent issues. This Department has drawn the attention of the
                        Government to the question and the matter will be brought up at the next
                        Council of Ministers. The attitude of the Egyptian Government towards now
                        companies is defined by Lord Cromer in his Report for 1889 as follows :- </p>
                    <p>"I wish to repeat the warning I gave last year, to the effect that, when it
                        is stated that the formation of an Egyptian Company has been sanctioned by
                        the Egyptian Government, this only means that the Company has conformed to
                        certain conditions laid down by the Government as an essential preliminary
                        to the sanotion being given. It does not mean more than this. It does not in
                        any way signify that the Government either approves or disapproves of the
                        special enterprise with which the Company is concerned, considered on its
                        own merits. ln saying this, I have no wish whatever to discourage native
                        investors. Some projects laid before them will, without doubt, be based on
                        thoroughly sound principles, and will be likely to prove remunerative.
                        Others, again, may be of a more doubtful and speculative character. The
                        Government does not undertake to distinguish between these two categories of
                        investments. Its functions are strictly limited to laying down certain
                        conditions, which the experience of other countries has shown to be of a
                        nature calculated to protect the interests of investors. The latter have
                        then to decide for themselves, and I should add that the experience of other
                        countries has also shown that no legislative or administrative measures can
                        adequately protect the careless investor. Egyptians, therefore, will do well
                        not to go to the one extreme of exaggerated mistrust of all projects which
                        may be laid before them, nor to the other extrema of accepting too hastily
                        the accuracy of any facts and opinions which may be embodied in a
                        prospectus, but to adopt the middle course, which consists in carefully
                        examining for them: selves, with the aid of competent friends, the merits of
                        each special proposal, whether it be put forward by Europeans or by their
                        own countrymen."</p>
                    <p>This passage is reproduced in the last Report and at the time of writing it
                        his Lordship had not changed his opinion as he re-endorses the views laid
                        down. During the few months since the last Report was written there has been
                        extraordinary activity on the part of the Com. pany promoter with the result
                        that the attention of the State Legal Department has been drawn to the
                        alleged abuse of founder's shares.</p>
                    <p>The "Progrès” remarks :-</p>
                    <p>Le contentieux de l'Etat a attiré l'attention du gouvernement sur
                        l'opportunité de se départir, dans la concession du décret d'autorisation
                        aux Sociétés anonymes, de l'attitude passive gardée jusqu'ici et ce dans
                        l'intérêt du public aussi bien que des promoteurs. Le contentieux a fait
                        ressortir l'inconvénient résultant de l'abus de parts de fondateur, qui
                        constituent un allechement immoral pour les souscripteurs et absorbe une
                        très grande partie des bénéfices sociaux. Le contentieux propose donc de ne
                        pas accorder l'autorisation aux Sociétés, qui auraient établi dans leurs
                        statuts la création de parts de fondateur.</p>
                    <p>Nous croyons savoir que le gouvernement a pris en sérieuse considération la
                        note de contentieux, mais qu'il n'en partage pas entièrement les vues. Le
                        département des finances préférerait réviser entièrement le règlement
                        relatif à la concession d'autorisation aux Sociétés anonymes dans un sens
                        qui lui permettrait d'examiner le fond et la forme d'une Société avant de
                        lui accorder l'autorisation. Le décret d'autorisation, tont en n'impliquant
                        pas la garantie de l'Etat, serait déjà pour le public une attestation
                        autorisée de la moralité de l'affaire. Cette mesure servirait en même temps
                        à empêcher la formation des Sociétés anonymes, qui portent un préjudice
                        sérieux aux bonnes Sociétés. Le gouvernement n'entend nullement combattre
                        cette forme d'association de capitaux qui est l'instrument le plus puissant
                        de l'économie moderne ; il se propose seulement de remplacer par la parole
                        écrite de la loi le système de l'arbitraire dans la concession de
                        l'autorisation nécessaire à l'existence légale des Sociétés anonymes.</p>
                    <p>Le système des parts de fondateur serait admis, subordonnément à leur nombre
                        et au quantum de leur participation aux profits sociaux, dans certaines

                        d'ap engagement aléatoire de capitaux important soit d'interventions utiles.
                        Il serait écarté dans les autres.</p>
                    <p>Cette question sera examinée dans le prochain Conseil des ministres. Elle
                        comporte des développements ultérieurs par lesquels nous reviendrons
                        prochainement, dès que nos renseignements nous le permettront.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto the conditions exacted by the Egyptian Government in regard to
                        founders' shares, preliminary to the Kherlivial sanction being obtained for
                        the formation of the company, have been that founders' shares shall not rank
                        for dividend until the ordinary shareholders have received at least 5 per
                        cent. The amount which the articles of association may assign to them shall
                        not exceed the half of this garplug and upon the winding-up of the company,
                        and after the reimbursement of the ordinary shareholders at par, the balance
                        of the Assets of the company shall be divided in the same proportion between
                        ordinary and food dera' shares.</p>
                    <p>Under the scheme now contemplated it in proposed to form a system of control
                        as regarde limited liability companies, and the Khedivial sánction, which
                        now simply means that the <cb n="2"/> company has conformed to certain
                        regulations, will henceforth be equivalent to an endorsement by the
                        Government that the company is based on principles which are believed to be
                        sound by the "Contentieux." Any such project is quite unworkable, for it
                        will inevitably place the Government in an invidious position vis-a-vis the
                        public, who will hold such a system of Supervision as tantamount to an
                        expression of the Government's approval or disapproval of the company, who
                        obtains or is refused the Khedivial sanction. Such grandmotherly legislation
                        is doubtless dictated by the best of motivos, bat it is beyond the sphere of
                        a Government's duties, and if any such project comes into force it will have
                        to be ignominiously withdrawn</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN LITERATURE.</head>
                    <p>Dr. Budge, of the British Museum, is a most laborious writer, and makes ample
                        use of the treasures in his keeping. We trust there is no truth in the
                        rumour that other savants, especially those who come from the Continent,
                        find access difficult even to texts already published which they desire to
                        verify in our Museum. At all events the present work, on the most difficult
                        province of hieroglyphics, shows ample learning and research. It seems to
                        us, however, somewhat of a "tweeny" book too special for the general public
                        and not quite satisfactory to the scholar. The main body of the work
                        consists in texts with translations, of which we do not profess to question
                        the accuracy. We cannot conceal our doubts whether the deciphering of the
                        Egyptian script, which is certainly sound as far as mere facts and the
                        ordinary forms of the old language are in question, has yet penetrated to
                        the real spirit of the language and the delicate nuances of moral and
                        poetical ideas, in fact, to the inner understanding of a language so long
                        dead and so foreign to our habits of thought. The Book of the Dead, above
                        all, seems to contain so much allegory and mysticism that the modern
                        decipherer can hardly feel sore that he has probed the real meaning of this
                        elaborate ritual. Dr. Badge seems satisfied that he has solved most of the
                        perplexities, and in what he calls his "prefatory” remarks, which appear in
                        the third volume, give as an analysis of the principal ideas and scenes in
                        two distinct books of Funeral Ritual. Nothing is more surprising than to
                        compare this analysis with the description given by Hincks of the Book, to
                        which he had access in 1848. That wonderful scholar had guessed a great part
                        of the sense at a time when the reading of the words, and the comparison of
                        various versions, was only in its infancy. And he, too, used to complain of
                        the difficulty of gaining an entrance to the treasure rooms of the British
                        Museum, not merely regarding Egyptian, but still more regarding those
                        Assyrian and Babylouia texts in which his studies still mark an epoch.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Budge is probably right when he draws a sharp distinction between the
                        theory of a merely material after life, containing a mere enhancement of
                        earthly pleasures, and that of a mystical union with the Sun God and of an
                        immaterial future. He also shows that the belief of rewards hereafter for
                        moral goodness in this life existed alongside a belief that magical formulæ,
                        if used by the dead, could coerce the powers of the next world and compel
                        them to admit the goal to the abode of the blegeel. But when he tells us
                        that "from the the Fourth Dynasty onwards there was a very large class who
                        had no belief in &amp; parely material beaven," he tells us what is
                        extremely unlikely in itself, and what he cannot have a tithe of the
                        necessary evidence to prove. At all ages and times the great majority of
                        people who have believed, or who do believe, in a future state have made
                        material pleasures a large part of their hopes. It is a highly interesting
                        question whether the moral or the magical view of the right of entrance into
                        heaven was the earlier. Dr. Badge seems to incline, in our opinion rightly,
                        to the priority of the magical view. Moral ideas are after all very scarce
                        among primitive people. The first notion of unseen influences among lavages
                        is that they are hostile or mischievous, and are to be controlled by the
                        magician or medicine man, Such may have been the condition of Egyptian
                        religion 10,000 years B.C. For even at the rise of the First Dynasty there
                        was an advanced civilisation : Dr. Budge thinks that the vignettes at the
                        head of each chapter of the Book of the Dead were illustrations of the text,
                        subsequently added. The more obvious view is that at some remote age pure
                        pictures were used and that they remained at the head of the chapter long
                        after they had been explained by a written text. We should more readily bow
                        to his authority on these professional questions if we found his judgement
                        sound on the obvious things in history. But this is not so : "In ancient
                        Egypt,” he tells us, "as elsewhere, the fortunes of the gods and the wealth
                        of their sanctuaries increased or declined according as the inhabitants of
                        the land wero prosperous or otherwise." This is in flagrant contradiction
                        with notorious facts in modern history. In Spain the Church has flourished
                        on the ruin of the people, and in on of Mr. MacCarthy's recent books it is
                        clearly proved that the splendour of the Roman Catholic churches and
                        religious houses in Ireland varies inversely with the prosperity of the
                        district. Wealth of the priests and poverty of the people are by no means
                        "opposing and contradictory" to use Dr. Budge's curious phrase in another
                        connection. But when a man studies mary languages he is less likely to be
                            <cb n="3"/> fastidious in the use of his own. His translation of the
                        Greek "Syrinx” as "Shepherd's pipe” is also to be criticised. The word means
                        any sort of tube or pipe in Greek, from the tunnel through a mountain to the
                        hollow reed ; and though he is most interesting on Tuat, the region of the
                        Dead encircling the world, he speaks of "the position of a disembodied
                        spirit" in it, and speaks of its ends (by which he seems to mean eastern and
                        western points on its circumference). But these matters are trifles.</p>

                        aux élections :</p>
                    <p>D'après les termes de la constitution arménienne qui, depuis 1860, fait
                        partie de la loi organique de l'empire ottoman, chaque province ou diocè e
                        habité par les arméniens doit avoir une assemblée générale composée d'un
                        minimum de vingt et an et d'un maximum de soixante quinze députés dont le
                        septième pris parmi les laïques élus au scrutin public, L'assemblée générale
                        ainsi constituée représente la suprême volonté de chaque communauté, elle a
                        la haute surveillance de toutes les affaires, elle nomme à la majorité des
                        voix les conseils Laïque et Religieux chargés de l'administration du culte,

                        public.</p>
                    <p>Le comité chargé de la surveillance des élections a élaboré la liste des
                        électeurs ainsi qu'une triple liste de candidats pour la facilité du
                        peuple.</p>

                        s'ils se trouvent sans famille. Les personnes ayant subi des condamnations
                        pénales ou ayant fait faillite ne sont ni électeurs ni éligible. Sont

                        <p>Sir E. Grey stated that no agreement existed with Russia, but that there
                            had been an increasing tendency on the part of England and Russia to
                            deal in a friendly manner with questions as they arise. This, he said,
                            has more than once, lately, led to co-operation, and he would be most
                            glad to encourage this tendency, which will naturally result in the
                            progressive settlement of questions wherein both are interested, and in
                            the strengthening of friendly relations.</p>

                        <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS.—The Government intended to apply the closure to the
                            first clause of the Education Bill last night, but refrained from doing
                            so owing to the keen interest which is developed in the amendment of Mr.
                            Chamberlain, which practically proposes to provide equal facilities for
                            all denominations, but not at the public expense.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND ENGLAND.<lb/>REMARKABLE ARTICLE.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Dicey has a thorough knowledge of this country, and any contribution from
                        him on modern Egypt is sure to be of interest. In the latest issue of the
                        "Empire Review” there is a remarkable article from him entitled "Our
                        Position in Egypt” from which we make the following extracts :-</p>
                    <p>I have always held that it would be the first duty of England - if ever she
                        assumes a Protectorate over Egypt-to obtain the cancelment of the
                        Capitulations. I hold that opinion as strongly as ever. This reform,
                        however, we can never carry out in practice till we take over the public
                        debt of Egypt, and make it known to the world that we regard Egypt as being
                        under the protection of Great Britain to be defended against internal or
                        external attack with the whole force of the British Empire. I do not see any
                        probability that any action of the kind I recommend will be undertaken by
                        our present Government or by any Government we are likely to see in office,
                        till such time as the British public realise the truth, that an avowed
                        Protectorate over Egypt is the sole manner by which England can continue,
                        permanently, to retain our command of the highway to India. The present
                        time, therefore, is not one in which we can pursue the prosecution of
                        reforms in Egypt, which can only be carried into practice with the assent of
                        the foreign Powers of Europe.</p>
                    <p>I noticed the other day a passage in a speech delivered by Lord Aldwyn,
                        better krown to us as Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, in which the late Chancellor
                        of the Exchequer claimed credit for the success which the Unionist
                        Government had obtained in Egypt. The passage was as follows: "They
                        established England as a Trustee for civilisation in Egypt with the assent
                        of other Powers.” It would be difficult to express the popular opinion
                        entertained in England as to our present position in Egypt more fully in
                        fewer words. It would be still more difficult to make more inaccurate
                        statements in so few words, England is not a Trustee for Egypt. Nobody ever
                        appointed her to this imaginary Trust. She occupied Egypt with her troops of
                        her own free will in defiance of the protest raised by France at the time of
                        our bombardment of Alexandria. The services she had undoubtedly rendered to
                        Egypt have been mainly, if not solely, due to our military occupation of the
                        country, not to any imaginary mandate with which we have been entrusted by
                        Europe. No Continental Power, except France, has ever given its formal
                        assent to our occupation. Germany alone has gone out of her way to express
                        approval of the way in which we have hitherto interpreted the "free hand"
                        given us by France, and by France alone ; and the assent of Europe has never
                        yet been accorded to our occupation by any International Congress or
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>On many occasions Foreign Powers have asked us for information as to the date
                        on which we intend to fulfil our repeated assurances, that we would
                        terminate our occupation and withdraw our troops. These demands have been
                        met by the evasive answer that we still adhere to our plighted word, but
                        that the time has not arrived when we could carry out our avowed purpose,
                        because Egypt is not yet qualified for independent self-government. I
                        repeat, as I have often asserted before now, that I am firmly convinced,
                        that from the date of our occupation after Tel-el-Kebir, and at any rate up
                        to the Sudan Campaign, no matter what party may have been in office, England
                        was genuinely desirous of withdrawing her troops from Egypt, and acted with
                        perfect good faith in its assurances to the above effect. But this
                        conviction, as a point on which I speak with some knowledge, is not shared,
                        and cannot well be expected to be shared by other European nations.
                        Moreover, if my personal conviction is shared by the world at large, the
                        fact would not modify our present position.</p>
                    <p>There can, I think, be no reasonable doubt that Germany was in the right in
                        the contention that the secret compact between England and France, as to the
                        form of administration to be introduced into Morocco under the Anglo-French
                        Agreement, could not be held as binding upon other European Powers, which
                        had political or commercial rights or interests in the Shereefian kingdom,
                        unless and until it had been submitted to and approved by an International
                        Conference. Germany insisted upon the submission of this compact to a
                        Conference. France gave way. The Conference was held, and was ultimately
                        decided in favour of the German contention. It is no concern of mine to
                        discuss whether Germany was well advised or otherwise in objecting to the
                        Anglo-French Agreement. I am dealing with facts as they are, not, perhaps,
                        as I personally could have wished that they had been. All I wish to point
                        out is that the decision of the Algeciras Conference, confirming as it does
                        the non-validity of the free hand accorded to France by the Anglo-French
                        Agreement, applies equally to the free hand in Egypt accorded to England in
                        Egypt by France.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>According to the precedent established at Algeciras, any European Power which
                        has political or commercial rights in Egypt would logically be entitled to
                        refuse her consent to any substantial changes which England might propose to
                        introduce into the relations between Egypt and other Continental Powers,
                        till these changes have been approved by an International Conference. There
                        can be no reasonable doubt that if such a Conference were to meet its first
                        step would be to demand an explicit explanation from England as to whether
                        she intends her military occupation to be permanent or temporary; and in the
                        former hypothesis when the occupation was to end, or in the latter
                        hypothesis, what guarantees were to be given for the preservation of the
                        rights now possessed in Egypt by the subjects of other nations than the two
                        parties to the free hand agreement. If this is so, I think all British
                        statesmen- to whatever party they may belong, or whatever their views may be
                        as to the internal administration of Egypt—will agree with me in holding
                        that the present moment is singularly infelicitous for proposing the formal
                        recognition of a British Protectorate over Egypt, or of suggesting the
                        expediency of cancelling the Capitulations and abolishing the International
                        Tribunals.</p>

                    <head>THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY. <lb/>SERIOUSLY THREATENED BY RHODESIA.</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.”</p>
                    <p>Sir,- The British Press just now is calling attention to the remarkable
                        development in tobacco cultivation in Rhodesia, and the fact is of great
                        interest to many of your readers since it means that an important Egyptian
                        industry is threatened with serious rivalry. It is actually stated, indeed;
                        that Rhodesian grown Turkish tobacco will within a few years displace the
                        majority of the imported Turkish and Egyptian cigarettes, the leaf in all
                        three cases being very similar in quality and flavour. The extent of this
                        impending competition is, however, a matter of pure guesswork at present,
                        but that it is not to be despised is evidenced by the fact that in six
                        months the British South Africa Co, through its London offices, has sold no
                        fewer than 1,000,000 cigarettes. Forewarned should be forearmed, and our
                        object in writing to you is to suggest that the Egyptian cigarette exporters
                        should at once take measures to reform their agency connections in Great
                        Britain, with a view to giving the British consuming public better terms.
                        This could be done without loss to the makers, for we have information of
                        most extravagant profits made by speculative importers. The "middleman" may
                        himself see the wisdom of meeting competition when Rhodesian cigarettes are
                        firmly established in public favour here, but the Egyptian manufacturers
                        would do well to anticipate competition, rather than delay protective
                        measures until it arrives. It is probably not realized in Egypt, moreover,
                        that cigarettes made in Greece—of excellent quality—are being very largely
                        sold in London at ‘cutting" prices.</p>
                    <p>The chief danger, however, is from Rhodesia, concerning which an important
                        English newspaper writes : — "Tobaccos generally smoked in England are hot
                        and heady, and often lacking in combustibility ; African tobaccos produce no
                        ill effects, and may be smoked constantly without destroying the aim of a
                        good rifle-shot. The public taste is steadily working in the direction of a
                        milder, freer-burning tobacco, and this is just the requirement which good
                        African tobacco fills. The tobaccos of every district have their own
                        distinguishing features, but the general description-that it is mild, highly
                        combustible, and free from heat and headiness— applies to nearly all the
                        leaf from the best districts of Rhodesia. If all the world requires African
                        tobacco, there is land enough in Rhodesia to supply it."—We are, etc.</p>

                    <p>It was unfortunate, but unavoidable, that three functions should have clashed
                        with each other yesterday. It was only right and fitting that the foundation
                        stone of the memorial to the late Queen Victoria should be laid on the
                        anniversary of her birthday, and so also was it in keeping with the
                        tradition of Empire Day that the British Club should have an "at home," but
                        these two factors militated against the success of the races yesterday,
                        There was a comparatively poor attendance of the public, and the meeting was
                        dull and uninteresting. The racing itself presented no particular feature of
                        interest, all the races being won in the easiest fashion. In the Derby, El
                        Tahawi, who was generally conceded to win, ran a perfect pig, and was
                        nowhere in the race, which went to Roland, with Damiano up. </p>
                    <p>An unfortunate and tragic incident marked the afternoon. Ishak Bey Hussein's
                        g.a.p. Nessim, while he was standing in front of the starting gate,
                        preparatory to the start, dropped down dead from heart disease. His jockey,
                        Stillwell, had a narrow escape, as the animal rolled over him, but
                        fortunately he managed to extricate himself without any injury. </p>
                    <p>The band of the 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers played a choice selection of music
                        during the afternoon, which considerably enlivened the proceedings.</p>

                    <p>There was some slight delay at the start owing to Ateche, who was jumping
                        about. Finally the lot was got off to a fair start. Wazir and Moofid made
                        most of the running together, with Rachid close up, till entering the
                        straight, when Mabsout and Rachid headed off, Moofid lying third. In the
                        straight Moofid regained the lead and Prince Soleil came to the front, the

                        maintained till entering the cutting, when Radium came through his horses
                        and led into the straight, where Kara Aslan passed Soleik. Radium was never
                        once overtaken and won in easy fashion by two lengths, three lengths between

                        was reached, when Chendi was done with and Shour and Gogo ran abreast.
                        Coming out of the cutting Shour had gained a slight advantage and kept it
                        all the way, winning comfortably by a length. Ada came with a rush at the
                        finish and secured second place from Gogo, who was three lengths behind.

                        Tahawi being in front, up to the mile post when the field spread out.
                        Nearing the mile post they closed up again, Nimrod, Boule de Neige, and
                        Roland taking up the running, and El Tahawi, of whom so much had been

                        There was a good race for home between Ajax II. and Aurelius which ended in
