                        the North Sea. In the history of international disputes, as in that of
                        private litigation, precedent counts for a great deal, and viewed in this
                        light it is impossible to regard the precedent just established as anything
                        less than epoch-making. The moral effect of the settlement arrived at upon
                        future differences of a like nature, even when, as in this case, a "vital
                        interest" and the "national honour" are involved, cannot fail to exert a
                        most powerful influence in favour of the preservation of peace. The gain,
                        therefore, to humanity at large is of an importance which cannot well be
                        exaggerated. It may not, indeed, be possible ever to wholly rid the world of
                        the scourge of war, but every successful effort that tends to lessen the
                        occasions when that ultima ratio may have to be resorted to reflects honour
                        upon the era in which it has been achieved, and transmits a heritage of
                        priceless worth upon succeeding ages. </p>
                    <p>"Have we progressed " is the question which every thinking man and woman are
                        asking themselves to-day. Those who hold that the answer should be in the
                        affirmative ground their contention upon the discoveries of science whereby
                        man's intellect has wrung from inanimate nature such secrets as enable him
                        to control and utilize her forces; they point inter alia to the advance of
                        medical knowledge and skill in combating disease, to the progress of public
                        hygiene, the spread of education, the higher standard of comfort in living,
                        the more humane treatment of criminals and lunatics, and the improved
                        methods of dealing with pauperism. Whilst ungrudgingly according due credit
                        to these and other factors in the march of civilization, it appears to us
                        that the general rise in man's moral ideals is the surest sign of progress;
                        and that this is best evidenced by a growing solidarity amongst the family
                        of nations, of which the submission of international differences to a
                        judicial forum furnishes the most conspicuous example. Tracing back the
                        history of the human race to its origin we find that the state of primitive
                        man was war. Warfare was his sole career and occupation. Every step
                        therefore in the process whereby this innate and inveterate instinct is
                        "cribbed, cabined, and confined" marks a stage in man's progress towards a
                        higher state of civilization. We may still be far away from the time when
                        the lion shall lie down with the lamb, swords be converted into
                        ploughshares, and the world be "lapped in universal law." But though the
                        millenium is not yet in sight, the latest instance of a peaceable adjustment
                        of differences between two great European nations is the most salient and
                        conclusive proof that the goal towards which civilized humanity converges is
                        being, if slowly, yet steadily, approached </p>

                        <p>Lent Lansdowne, in a communication to the London Chamber of Commerce,
                            said that Russia had met all the representations of Great Britain and
                            the United States in a conciliatory manner. He understood that the
                            Russian Naval Commanders had recently been furnished with instructions
                            which would result in them exercising their rights less vexatiously in
                            future. He was unable to find any grounds for the suggestion that the
                            Russians favoured German ships compared with British. It was obviously
                            impossible for any Government to inform shippers whether particular
                            cargoes were entitled to enjoy immunity from seizure.</p>

                                officers by means of reports from the Masonic Lodges. General André
                                declared that clerical intolerance was still so strong in the Army
                                that he was compelled to resort to external channels in order to
                                obtain in- formation regarding the political opinion of officers. M.
                                Syveton rushed up to General André and battered him in the face with
                                his fists. The General collapsed, blood streaming from him. A wild

                            <p>M. de Cassagnac, who was the son of Adolphe Granier de Cassagnac, was
                                born about 1840, and became at an early age a contributor to the mi
                                nor Parisian journais. He soon acquired notoriety by the fierceness
                                of his personal attacks on hie contemporaries and the numerous duels
                                to which they gave rise. In 1866, under the auspices of his father,
                                he joined the staff of Le Pays, of which soon afterwards he became
                                the principal editor. Since then he has been perpetually embroiled
                                in quarrels with his brother journalists and anti-Bonapartist politi
                                cians. It would be difficult to enumerate all the "affairs of
                                honour" in which he had been engaged, but his duel with the late M.
                                Gustave Florens in 1869 may be mentioned as being one of the most
                                desperate fought in recent times. M. Paul de Cassagnac was decorated
                                with the Legion of Honour on the Emperor's tete-day in 1666, and in
                                July, 1869, was elected a member of the Conseil Géneral for the
                                department of Gers. On the declaration of war against Prussia in
                                August 1870, M. Paul de Cassagnac, who was still suffering from a
                                recent wound in the chest, and who had just been appointed a Major
                                of the Garde Mobile of the department ot Gers, preferred to enrol
                                himself as a volunteer in the first regiment of Zouaves. Taken
                                prisoner at Sedan, he was imprisoned eight months at Kosel in
                                Silesia. On recovering his liberty he went to Venice for the benetit
                                of his health, and afterwards established in the department of Gers
                                L'appel au Peuple, a political Journal which met with considerable
                                success. Returning to Paris in January, 1872, he resumed the
                                editorship of Le Pays. In July of that year he was condemned to a
                                week's imprisonment, and to pay a fine of 100 francs, in consequence
                                of his duel with M Lockroy. On July 7, 1873, he fought a duel on the
                                Luxemburg frontier with M. Ranc, a Paris journalist, both combatants
                                being wound led, and M. Rane disabled. He was tried in Paris, July
                                2, 1874, for the publication in Le Pays of articles calculated to
                                disturb the public peace, and to stir up hatred and con tempt
                                between citizens. M. Paul de Cassagnac undertook his own defence and
                                obtained la verdict of "Not Guilty," a result which was regarded by
                                the Bonapartists as signal triumph. In 1874 he published in his
                                journal a series of violent articles in refe rence to the
                                capitulation of Sedan, the whole responsibility of which was thrown
                                on to General Wimpffen's shoulders. 'The General accordingly
                                instituted a prosecution for libel in the Assize Court of the Seine,
                                but M. Paul de Cassagnac wasacquitted by the jury (Feb. 1875). On
                                November 24, 1875, he delivered at a meeting at Belleville a speech
                                in which he contended that the restoration of the Empire was the
                                essential condition of tho welfare of the people. The Pays and other
                                newspapers were prosecuted for printing a report of this discourse,
                                but they were all acquitted. M. Paul de Cas sagnac was returned to
                                the National Assembly by the arrondissement of Condom in the
                                Department of Gers, at the general elections of February, 1876, and
                                October, 1877. The latter election was annulled by the Chamber,
                                November 11, 1878, but in the following February M. de Cassagnae was
                                elected, and he has been at subsequent general elections. Of late
                                years his fiery zeal had somewhat abated chiefly on necount of the
                                unfortunate dissensions in the Bonaparte family, but during the
                                Boulangist agitation he sided strongly with the party of the late
                                General, and in the September elections of 1889 his followers were
                                directed to support Revisionist candidates wherever Conservatives
                                failed to present themselves. In 1884 he ceased editing the Pays,
                                and founded the Autorité, in the columns of which he constantly
                                attacked the present Republican order. </p>

                    <p>A curious incident occurred a few days ago. A Sudan Government patrol dhow

                        fleet had entered the harbour of Sheikh Barghout, the future princi pal port
                        ofthe Sudan, and had occupied it !! The Sudan Port S.S. Hawke was ordered to
                        steam there immediately, and Bimbashi Drury, R.N., Controller of Sudan
                        Ports, took the Harke and went to Sheikh Barghout, where they found that the
                        French fleet which was bound for Djibouti had encountered bad weather and
                        put in at the former port. They were transferring coal from one man-of-war

                    <head>ARMY OF OCCUPATION <lb/> KING"S BIRTHDAY REVIEW </head>
                    <p>The following article appeared in the Morning Post of Saturday last. It will
                        be remembered that some letters on this same subject appeared in our columns
                        last year.</p>
                    <p>British soldiers in Egypt are no doubt looking forward with loyal enthusiasm
                        to the approaching celebration of King Edward's birthday in Cairo. They will
                        be eager that it should lack nothing of the splendour and enthusiasm of
                        former occasions, and in that sentiment we all join most warmly since no one
                        doubts that each day of our Monarch's reign adds to the affection in which
                        he is held by his people. Soon after the celebration last year a suggestion
                        was made that the choice of a review ground in Cairo might be more tactful
                        and judicious. There is no difficulty in finding a place whereon to present
                        all the ceremonial of a review without the slightest risk of provoking
                        adverse comment. 'The troops might be massed at Abbassieh, or on the
                        racecoarse, or at Ulena, for any of these places would be suitable. But the
                        Abdeen Square is in full view of the Kherlive's palace, and to hold a purely
                        British demonstration there, especially as it is so essentially military in
                        character, has been deemed a tactless thing, capable of being gravely
                        misunder stood by a sensitive people whose goodwill it should be our highest
                        aim to encourage by every means in our power. We are certain no British
                        officer or representative contemplated the possibility of offence being
                        given when the selection of Abdeen Square as a review ground was first made.
                        It was chosen because it was most central, yet the fact that the space is
                        somewhat limited for the purpose and that better ground can be found
                        elsewhere may give some excuse for the feeling of suspicion in Egyptian
                        minds that if not espressly intended as a demonstration of power, it is at
                        least an indication of mere indifference to native sentiment. In such a caso
                        as this it is hardly necessary to argue whether the feeling <floatingText>

                        it has arisen is the most complete reason for taking the necessary steps to
                        convince the Khedive and his people that we are not only willing, but eager
                        to remove the slightest cause of misundorstanding. For it is the natural aim
                        of wise British policy in Egypt to make the occupation which financial and
                        political circumstances rendered necessary a boon to the country in every
                        sense. We know from the infinite variety of our experience in India and
                        elsewhere that this is not impossible that, indeed, it is comparatively ensy
                        to make native rulers and their people so warmly appreciative of the
                        substantial advantages of British alliance that they overflow with loyalty
                        to the British Throne and are eager at all times to share in the honour of
                        its defence. The secret of our success has been a desire to act with
                        absolute justice and to show the most complete respect for native sentiment.
                        In the case of Egypt there are special reasons why we should be considerate.
                        We are not there as arrogant conquerors, but as supporters of the reigning
                        dynasty. We entered in that charaoter, and have been able to silence the
                        jealous clamour of other nations for our withdrawal by pointing to the fact
                        that every step taken to strengthen the financial condition of the country
                        and to develop its material resources has had the sup port of the Khedive
                        and his chief advisers. Our function is to aid and to protect, because the
                        peaceful progress of Egypt is so closely bound up with the security of our
                        "main road to India' that we can never be indifferent to what is happening
                        in the country. So much has been done by the genius of such men as Lord
                        Cromer, Lord Kitchener, and Sir William Garstin that those who look at the

                        Khedive's favour.The difference it makes is that we are enabled to deal with
                        a people who are friendly instead of having to guard ourselves at every step
                        against hostile sentiment and sullen resistance. British officers have
                        taught Egyptian conscripts how to bear themselves with honour in war, but
                        the knowledge that their own native ruler wished I them to be faithful mado

                        expeditions of great hardship and difficulty. So, too, all the great
                        irrigation works and schemes of reform in which we have been engaged have
                        prospered largely by reason of the confidence in their purpose inspired by
                        the Khedive's participation. It is not only a duty which we owe to the
                        Egyptian people, but also the highest policy to foster this confidence by
                        the most harmonious co-operation and the greatest care to refrain from any
                        acts capable of misconstruction. We may justly claim to have done much for
                        Egypt during the years of occupation, and the excellent feeling which has
                        been created ought on no account to suffer prejudice through any want of
                        readiness to profit by a warning that in one or two matters we have failed
                        to give adequate consideration to native sentiment. It will be so easy to
                        avoid offence in the choice of a place for future birthday reviews that this
                        reminder of what was said last year will, we trust, be sufficient to ensure
                        a change. </p>

                    <p>The Grand Hotel, Helouan, opened its doors on the 1st November. Many
                        applications for rooms have been received and there is every prospect of a
                        very good season. The magnificent hall which has been built during the
                        summer is the admiration of all the visitors staying already at the Grand.

                    <head>EGYPTIAN PAPYRI</head>
                    <p>The celebrated papyrus found in a Greek tomb at Abusir by Dr. Borchardt,
                        containing the lost poem, "The Persians," by Timotheus of Miletus, has
                        proved a most difficult subject for philologists. The text is, from its
                        extreme age, very faint, the papyrus also torn and damaged, and the style,
                        and even language, of the author quite now in portions of the work.</p>
                    <p>The editio princeps was by Professor von Wilamowitz Moellendorff, and recent
                        workers upon the facsimile of the papyrus have not appreciably advanced our
                        comprehension of the manuscript, beyond his primary version. In the American
                        Journal of Philology Professor Basil S. Gildersleeve has printed a consider-
                        able number of illuminating comments upon various difficult parts of the
                        text. From his remarks it would appear that unless another copy is found it
                        is unlikely that a connected and intelligible translation of the new
                        literary treasure can ever be made.</p>
                    <p>It is curious that the fragments published by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt of
                        the famous lost tragedy by Sophocles, "The Niobe," short as they are, have
                        decided an important point in the history of ancient art, for they prove
                        that the well-known fresco at Pompei is really a picture of a scene in this
                        play.</p>
                    <p>Professor Goodspeed, who, in the "Chicago Studies in Classical Philology"
                        published a number of fiscal papyri from Karanis, has also edited a short
                        medical fragment in the American Journal of Philology.</p>
                    <p>The series of papyri discovered in the Fayoum which are given in the 4th
                        volume of "Oxyrhynchus Papyri'' distributed to subscribers to the "Egypt
                        Exploration Fund" this autumn, will always be considered chiefly in
                        connection with the "New Sayings of Jesus," which will doubtless produce
                        many volumes of commentary and controversy. It contains several important
                        classical fragments, the most valu- able of which is the epitome of some of
                        the books of Livy's "Roman History."</p>
                    <p>The Greek fragments present precious specimens of lost works, especially the
                        portions of Pindar's Parthenia, and an ode also probably 1 penned by him;
                        and a much damaged text of the argument to Cratinus' lost comedy the "Dionys
                        Alexandros;" and a part of a treatise upon musical scales by
                        Aristoxenus.</p>
                    <p>The pieces, unfortunately, of Greek texts are all extremely short, and with
                        the exception of a legal document containing a certificate of pagan
                        sacrifice, doubtless obtained by some personage suspected of Christianity,
                        are necessarily quite incomplete. This is the third specimen of these
                        libelli, and their phraseology is now clearly known.</p>
                    <p>The abstract of chief events from parts of Livy is a much more valuable find.
                        Half of it covers Books 48 to 55 of his famous work which are lost, though a
                        brief summary <cb n="5"/> of them, quite different from that in this new
                        papyrus is extant.</p>
                    <p>The period described is from B. C. 150-187 and is of great historical
                        interest for therein occurred the third Punic War and the fourth Macedonian
                        one, also the Achaean and Spanish campaigns, The, new epitome being.
                        strictly chronological, which the previously known one was not, will be of
                        great use to historians. It contains an enumeration of the Consuls for each
                        year, and a close study. of it may lead to a final decision as to whether
                        some authors who have been sup- posed to have been merely copyists of Lávy,
                        may not have, as probably he did, founded their works upon the Consular
                        archives, which were in existence, and gave not merely the annual consular
                        names and Fasti, or events which most distinguished their years of office.
                        If so the similarity between such historical records and the "Eponym Canon''
                        of Assyria becomes most striking.</p>
                    <p>The greatest light given by the papyrus is upon the Spanish War, for which
                        existing information such as Appian was very con- fusing, but the whole
                        decade from B.C. 150 to 140 now becomes brilliantly clear.</p>
                    <p>The numerous legal statistical documents, chiefly of Roman times, need
                        special study. The two petitions to the Emperors Septimus Severus and
                        Caracalla are likely to be most useful to jurists, whilst the tour of
                        inspection in Lower Egypt about A.D. 50 will be equally welcome to
                        geographers. It, when compared with M. Amelineau's Geography of Coptic,
                        Egypt and Vicomte de Rouge's Geography of Lower Egypt, will decide several
                        questions of interest.</p>
                    <p>The list of towns and villages in the Fayoum revealed to us by the new papyri
                        continually augments, and others may be added from the papyri published in
                        the "Bulletin Correspondence Hellénique" by M. Pierre Jouguet, and various
                        other sporadically edited documents from the same district.</p>

                        <head>THE FUTURE OF THE EGYPTIAN </head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p>Sir, I have just read, with much interest, a leading article in your
                            issue of last Friday week, dealing with the future of the Egyptian. The
                            writer admits that Egypt is flourishing and developing in almost every
                            direction, but that the Egyptians themselves do not appear to be sharing
                            as they ought to do in the general advance. There is some truth in this
                            last statement, but they really share in this advance more than any
                            European imagines. It is only natural that Egypt should be in a greater
                            state of prosperity than the Egyptians themselves. The familiar
                            expression "born in Egypt" has been and will always be true of our
                            native country, and if it has been hidden for a time it was only due to
                            bad government, and the English did not find great difficulty in getting
                            it out, because nature has endowed Egypt with the wonderful Nile and
                            good</p>
                        <p>climate.</p>
                        <p>But in the case of the Egyptian it is different. He has been cruelly
                            handicapped till about thirty years ago. He was ill-treated, over-
                            taxed, underpaid, misgoverned, and indeed he suffered beyond description
                            all that tended to lower man's soul down to the ground. It is quite
                            unfair to expect him to compete with the Europeans of today after such a
                            short time of freedom and good rule. For what is a quarter of a century
                            in the life of a nation</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless the Egyptian has made a marked progress in every direction.
                            As an example I give the following incident:-</p>
                        <p>I know a Copt personally well in Upper Egypt who was taught about
                            thirty-five years ago, in a kuttab, how to write and read Arabic, also
                            elementary arithmetic. That was all; he did not even know that there was
                            such thing as Arabic grammar. The blind teacher used his unfortunate
                            stick far too much. The kuttab was far dirtier than our dirtiest stables
                            of to-day, and the "scholars" used to sit on a dirty tom mat. The fees
                            were two small loaves of bread a week. It did not matter if the boy came
                            bare-headed or bare-footed or both, so long as he had his galabieh
                            on.</p>
                        <p>To-day, the son of this Copt goes to a school in the same town which
                            compares very favourably with similar schools here. He is taught by
                            seven or eight masters, studies many subjects, speaks English fairly
                            well, plays foot- ball and knows what a penalty kick is. He would not
                            wear a made-up tie because he thinks it is common. Progress is not less
                            striking in the mode of our living, social life, etc.</p>
                        <p>When the old tell us their experiences in their early days and try to
                            make a contrast between it and what they see to-day we simply marvel at
                            the difference and wonder if such change can be possible. There is no
                            doubt that the Egyptian is moving on, and that can be easily seen by
                            himself and any foreigner who cares to watch him closely. It is only
                            natural that he cannot succeed to-day in starting a light railway
                            company or suggesting a big scheme. He is like a schoolboy studying,
                            watching and learning every day till the time comes when he will take
                            the responsibility on his own shoulders. But will they let him Yes,
                            certainly, "Egypt is for the Egyptians,"</p>
                        <p>is it not 1</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian would be in a better state still if the Government study
                            their interests more than that. It is Egypt which takes nearly the whole
                            attention of the English. It is true that the natives, with all the
                            others, benefit from this, but surely the Egyptian may ask for something
                            more in his own land. The bulk of those millions waiting to be spent
                            will be probably given to "argent" irrigation works. It seems to me that
                            there is only the raising of the Assouan dam which should be carried out
                            soon, and we need not deal with any gigantic works for the next ten
                            years.</p>
                        <p>The Government does not spend half enough on education. The prejudice
                            against female education has died out completely among the Muslims, and
                            the Copts are as anxious as ever to educate their daughters. But what
                            has the Government done in this respect? Precious little. The necessity
                            of girls' schools in all parts of Egypt cannot be overestimated, and
                            this neglect is sorely felt all over the country. What can L.E. 204,000
                            do for the Egyptian Ministry of Public Instruction in one year! The
                            natives who belong to the Government services especially those in the
                            moudiriehs are underpaid and underworked. In an office where six clerks
                            are engaged, three would be quite sufficient. They work about 4 hours a
                            day in the busiest part of the year. A native told me that he was better
                            off twenty years ago when he received LE. 3 a month than now on LE 8.
                            There are hundreds and thousands of effelis who draw L.E. 5 a month.
                            Indeed, it is a well-known fact among the Egyptians that the cost of
                            living has almost trebled during the last twenty-five years. But it is
                            only the natives who know that, because the English as a rule lives
                            quite aloof when he is in the districts, and fancies himself in London
                            when he is in Cairo.</p>
                        <p>It is quite true that he loves his duty and does it well and to this
                            quality Egypt owes its present prosperity, but he does not know the
                            Egyptian outside the office or mondirieh. The latter would like to ask
                            the former to have more consideration and regard for him, take more
                            interest in him and above all trust him, especially if he is young.</p>
                        <p>The modern Egyptian can only be ruled by kindness.</p>
                        <p>Let no Englishman listen to what some may say about one community or
                            another among the natives, but let him prove things for him- self and
                            road authorised historical facts or else be will be tempted to be
                            somewhat partial.</p>

                        <p>The Country Egypt has benefited so much by the English that it can afford
                            to be left to itself for a time. Let them now turn their attention, more
                            than they did before, to the Egyptian himself and see what they can do
                            for him, his daughter, and his son.</p>

                        <head>BRITISH RECREATION CLUB.<lb/>A BOLD CLAIM.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p>Sir, I was delighted to read in a letter addressed to you from the
                            British Recreation Club, and signed by a member of that club, Mr. R.
                            Knight Foley, a paragraph relative to the claims to the Ghezireh
                            grounds. The letter appeared in your issue of November 1 and dealt with
                            the subject of the reduction of the garrison. Towards the end of the
                            letter the spokesman for the British Re creation Club made the following
                            significant remarks, I use the qualification "significant advisedly for
                            inasmuch as the letter was addressed from the British Recreation Club
                            and signed by a member of that club, we may infer that the club means to
                            hint what it intends to be its line of policy in regard to a question
                            which vitally affects all members of the British community of Cairo. The
                            member of the Cairo British Recreation Club writes thus:-</p>
                        <p>"Perhaps the Ghesireh grounds may revert to the British community, which
                            is now excluded by "Members only.""</p>
                        <p>The Ghezireh grounds now do, and always did, belong to the whole of the
                            British community in Egypt, and were formally handed over (or let) for
                            the use of that body by H.H. the late Khedive Tewtik Pasha. It is only
                            fair to mention that at the time nearly every member of the then
                            existing community was a member of the Sporting Club, such as existed at
                            the time. But things are very much altered now-a-days, and if any member
                            of the community, who is not a member of the Turf or Sporting Clubs,
                            wishes to use the grounds for either himself or his family, I fail to
                            see who can prevent him-that is, of course, if he wishes to raise the
                            question, and if the question is once raised I feel confident that both
                            H.H. the Khedive and Lord Cromer would be delighted to see the grounds
                            used by the rightful and lawful owners and their families, even although
                            their position does not entitle them to be elected members of the Turf
                            or Sporting Clubs. The annual rent, or hire, paid for the ground is only
                            a nominal figure, in acknowledgment of the ownership.</p>
                        <p>It is to be sincerely hoped that the British Recreation Club will
                            champion the cause of the British community and will not allow us to be
                            deprived of our rights. I heartily congratulate</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p>Sir-Your article in yesterday's Gazette deserves to be pondered over by
                            every Britisher who has any commercial interests in this country. I have
                            many opportunities for observing the baneful influences exercised by
                            foreigners representing British firms. I may mention, as one instance
                            out of many, that not long ago a foreigner came to my shop and wanted me
                            to give him an order for mosquito nets. He informed me that I had
                            already done business with a well-known English firm, and he, to my
                            astonishment, produced a sample of the very article I had been
                            accustomed to obtain. Furthermore, he was good enough to vouch safe full
                            details of the price that I had been charged. On my demanding where he
                            had obtained this information he stated he was not only an agent for the
                            Continental firm but also the representative of the English house. He
                            did his level best to push the article of his compatriots and to
                            depreciate the similar article of the English firm. He even went so far
                            as to offer me the same article at considerably cheaper rates if I
                            purchased it from the Continental house. This is a good instance of the
                            evils attending the employment by British firms of foreign agents. I
                            could give numerous other instances to prove the truth of my
                            statements.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I was indeed pleased to see by your issues of the 2nd and 3rd inst.
                            that yourself and Mr. Springer have come forward to plead the grievances
                            of the inhabitants of Helouan. As to the water supply, I can only say
                            that it is filthy for bathing and washing purposes, and as to the road
                            leading to the Nile, that two ladies from our hotel drove down yesterday
                            and on their return they were entirely knocked up owing to the hardness
                            of the journey. The higher authorities that be are not possibly aware of
                            such a state of things, or they would take immediate steps to remedy the
                            evil. As what has appeared in your paper may cause uneasiness to
                            intending visitors to Helouan, I beg to state that steps are taken at
                            all the hotels to filter the water and thus render it drinkable and
                            wholesome. This applies equally to the water used in the rooms. and
                            kitchen.</p>

                    <head>CAPE TO CAIRO RAILWAY. </head>
                    <p>The construction of the Cape to Cairo Rail- way is proceeding satisfactorily,
                        and the route which the line will traverse towards Khartoum has been
                        tentatively decided upon. At present (says the Bulawayo Chronicle) the line
                        is in progress of construction on the north side of Victoria Falls towards
                        Kalomo, while the work of erecting the huge bridge which will cross the
                        falls is proceeding from either side. It is hoped by the time the Kalomo
                        line is finished that arrangements will have been made for ex- tending the
                        railway another 250 miles to the copper district north of the Kafue River,
                        and then the project is to carry the line to Lake Tanganyika. The railway
                        will traverse the north of Eastern Rhodesia to the south end of the lake. It
                        has not yet been decided whether the line will follow the eastern shore of
                        the waterway or whether steamers on the lake will be employed to continue
                        the means of communication. The railway, however, will be joined with the
                        Uganda line and then pushed north- wards past Fashoda to Khartoum.</p>

                    <p>MRS COL. E. J. GRESHAM, Treasurer Daughters of the Confederady, and President
                        Herndon Village Improvoment Society, writes the following letter from

                    <p>The Peruna Medicine Co., Columbus, O.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen I cannot speak too highly of the value of Peruna. I believe that I
                        owe my life to its wonderful merits. I suttered with catarrh of the head and
                        lungs in its worst form, until the doctors fairly gave me up, and I
                        despaired of ever gotting well again.</p>
                    <p>"I noticed your advertisement and the splendid testimonials given by people
                        who had been cured by Peruns, and determined to try a bottlo. I felt but
                        little <cb n="6"/>better, but used a second and third bottle and kept
                        improving slowly.</p>
                    <p>"It took six bottles to cure me, but they were worth a king's ransom to me. I
                        talk Peruna to all my friends and am a true believer in its worth."</p>
                    <p>Mrs Col E J Gresham</p>
                    <p>Thousands of women owe their lives to Peruna. Tenths of thousands owe their
                        health to Perunal Hundreds of thousands are praising Peruna in every state
                        of the Union. We have on file a great multitude of letters, with written

                    <head>CHRONIQUE THEATRALE <lb/> TARTUFFE <lb/> LES PRÉCIEUSES RIDICULES </head>
                    <p>Les alexandrins ont assisté hier à la première représentation de la tournée
                        Coquelin. En dépit du mauvais temps, le pablie n'avait pas laissé une place
                        vide et dès 9 heures plusieurs centaines de voitures encombraient les abords
                        du théâtre Zizinia, rendant la circulation impossible aux piétons.</p>
                    <p>Dans Tartufe le héros de la pièce ne paraît qu'au troisième acte et c'est
                        avec une impatience pareille à celle du bon- homme Orgon que l'assistance
                        attendait l'apparition du pauvre homme. Quand il entre enfin en scène, c'est
                        avec un ton nerre d'applaudissements qu'il est accueilli immédiatement
                        d'ailleurs le spectateur est saisi par la puissance, la conviction et la
                        finesse de l'acteur. Les moindres détails de l'action sont rendus sveo une
                        vérité saisissante; il faut citer en particulier la scène de la tentative de
                        séduction où M. Coquelin a déployé toutes les ressources de son génie; la
                        façon dont il surprend encore la crédulité d'Orgon malgré la découverte de
                        son infamie forme un tableau inoubliable qui a été rendu à la perfection.
                        Admirable aussi la deuxième scène de séduction, tandis que le mari est esché
                        sous la table, et enfin le couronnement:</p>
                    <p>"La maison est a moi, je le ferai connaître"</p>
                    <p>"C’est a vous d’en sortir qui me parlez en maître"</p>
                    <p>Nous n'avons pas ici la prétention d'analyser le talent du célèbre comique.
                        D'autres l'ont fait avant nous et mieux encore que toute critique ce qui
                        juge pas grand artiste comme un grand auteur c'est l'accueil que leur fait
                        le public. Celui-ci a immortalisé le nom de Coquelin. Le plaisir qu'il prend
                        toujours à le voir et à l'entendre, le sentiment délicieux qu'il ressent à
                        la perfection de son jeu sont la preuve de son génie. Le public du Zizinis
                        l'a témoigné hier par ses applaudissements. Une remarque que d'autres auront
                        faite sans doute c'est que M. Coquelin, tout en donnant à son rôle toute la
                        mesure dont il est susceptible,n'a cependant jamais l'air de faire "une
                        charge". C'est qu'il donne la note juste. C'est qu'il étudie son rôle sur
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>La chose a été surtout remarquable dans la petite pièce qui a terminé la
                        représenta tion: Les Précieuses Ridicules Bien ne semble devoir être plus
                        arid: à la lecture que l'interminable è se entre Mascarille et les
                        précieuses ridicules et cependant rien ne peut dire imaginé de plas bouffon
                        ni de plus amusant, lorsque cela est mis sur la scène et qu'il y a pour
                        jouer Mascarille aa Coquelin. La passage de l'impromptu a été délicieux et
                        souligné des éclats de rire de toute l'assistance. La dernière scène, celle
                        de la morale a été passée sous silence; et cela vaut autant, peut-être, car
                        chacun peut aisément en tirer la conclusion. Elle est évidente.</p>
                    <p>Nous serions injustes de ne pas dire un mot des autres artistes qui figurent
                        dans In pièce. Bien qu'il soit difficile de se distinguer en compagnie du
                        maître et surtout de l'éclipse, ils sont de première force. M. Rosenberg a
                        été excellent dans les rôles d'Orgon et de Georgibas, Mmes Devoyod et
                        Bouchetal dans les rôles d'Elmire et Dorine, Magdelon et Cathos, Mile Lepage
                        dans le rôle de Marianne.</p>

                    <p>The wholly uncalled for interference of Germany in the re-adjustment of
                        political relations between British India and Thibet precisely squares with
                        a still more notable demonstration of the intimate and Cordial connection
                        between the Kaiser and the Tsar. Apparently anxious to go behind the regular
                        processes of diplomacy, they have jointly re- vived the old system of
                        strictly confidential communications carried on through their re -pective
                        military attaches at Berlin and St. Petersburg. Each monarch will thus learn
                        the inner mind of his Imperial friend without any over hearing by
                        Ministerial ears. While, for instance, Lord Lansdowne and Count Lamsdorff
                        are engaged in unravelling this or that complication with patient fingers,
                        the Emperors, conversing through their military echoes, may have come to
                        some secret settle- ment of the matter in dispute. There will be no official
                        record of these subterranean opera- tions, even if the two Foreign Offices
                        were so disposed, they could not, in their ignorance, throw any light on the
                        workings of the Im perial minds and consciences. But there is one way,
                        fortunately, by which the intricacies of this personal alliance may be
                        roughly guessed.</p>
                    <p>When either Power palpably goes out of its way to confer an obligation on the
                        other without self-committal, it may be pretty safely assumed that the Tsar
                        and the Kaiser have been operating on the new machinery. It is a ready
                        conjecture, for instance, that when the Tsar lately reduced the Russian
                        garrisons on the German frontier by three brigades, he did so with the
                        knowledge that the proceeding was based on an understanding with his
                        illustrious friend at Berlin. And from that assumption, it is easy to pass
                        on to a guess that the German Minister at Peking received instructions to
                        prevent, in he could, the ratification of the Anglo-Thibetan Treaty</p>
                    <p>It is not often that a false issue can be disposed of so quickly or
                        convincingly as the Or that Chinese labour in South Africa would prove
                        hostile to the interests of the British workman. Mr. Lyttleton placed

                        is always a tenerarious proceeding. The committee who have used "Hymns
                        Ancient and Modern" with some violence are getting ample proof of this fart.
                        Criticism is pouring upon their heads, mostly of an adverse kind. Men and

                    <p>A serious increase in the numbers of the insane is shown by the annual report
                        of the Asylums Committee of the L. C. C. for the Ver ending March 31, 1904.
                        The figures, which cover London alone, give a total of: 25,948 lunatics for
                        1904, or 996 more than in 1903, an increase of over 4 per cent. So large an
                        advance is at first sight very alarming, but it must be remembered that we
                        are becoming every year more solicitous for the registration and control of
                        the mentally deficient.</p>
                    <p>The fact that Kingsway and Aldwych are to he lighted by gas and not by
                        electricity will come as a surprise to "the man in the street,' whose
                        experience of street lighting is contined</p>
                    <p>to what he sees in the street. But incandescent gas moler pressure has made
                        such headway during the past few years that electricity as a street
                        illuminant has been badly beaten both on the score of cheapness and
                        efficiency. The are light is ruinously expensive, and when the contract
                        period for lighting the City's streets has expired incandescent gas will

                        descent electric light out of the field, even in districts like Islington,
                        Shoreditch, and South- wark, where the borough councils have every reason to
                        do all they can in support of their own electric lighting undertakings.</p>
                    <p>To the ping pong eye, the billiard arm, and bicycle stoop must be added the
                        new complaint of "bridgitis." It is the consequence of over- indulgence in
                        bridge, and attacks players, especially those who spend their days and
                        nights in the fascinating game. The symptoms are violent pains in the head,
                        particularly behind the ears.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Burns is beginning to find out that it is possible for even the
                        County Council to do too much for his horny-handed protegés. He opposed the
                        building of a new mammoth lodging-house in the Drury lane quarter on Tuesday
                        on the ground that such institutions promoted "an undesirable kind of club
                        life. The man who is in regular work, says Mr. Burns, should be married and
                        living in his own house a sentiment to which the imagination can hear all
                        female Battersea twittering its applause. It does not necessarily follow
                        that if we could evict the celibate sybarites of Parker street and Deptford,
                        the result would be an avalanche of banns or a momentous addition to the
                        domestic bliss of the Metropolis. But on one point Mr. Burns gives a warning
                        which may be well founded and is worth attention. He declares that the
                        combined energies of the County Council, the Rowton House movement, and the
                        Salvation Army are attracting to London more than its fair propor- tion of
                        the country's vagabondage. Some such result is always to be traced when one
                        part of the country begins to outstrip the rest in philanthropic enterprise.
                        Unless provincial cities follow suit to the great strides which London has
                        made in provision for the homeless, we may be confronted before long with a
                        very grave social difficulty.</p>
                    <p>An ingenious but dangerous attempt was made on Thursday afternoon to solve
                        the "Zutka mystery at the Hippodrome. "Zutka is a large and apparently human
                        figure of the Phroso type, which comes out of a small box in full view of
                        the audience. Some person unknown attempted to solve the problem as to
                        whether it is animate or not by leaving a bottle containing chloroform in
                        the box. The result was that the showman who opened the lid fell unconscious
                        on the stage. Supposing the figure to be human, the daring experi menter
                        might easily find himself the central figure of a trial for manslaughter. A
                        similar attempt was once made on the celebrated auto- maton chess-player. A
                        member of the au- dience called "Fire" whereupon the "auto- maton" rolled
                        frantically about, and betrayed the presence of the man concealed in its
                        works. A story, which is so astonishing that it reads almost like fiction,
                        was told at the Guildhall on Wednesday. It had reference to Cecil Brown
                        Smith, a well-dressed man, who described himself as an electrical engineer,
                        living at Bramah House, Beardell-street, Upper Norwood, and who was charged
                        with begging.</p>
                    <p>A detective saw the prisoner standing out- side the Bank of Scotland, and in
                        his left hand he held a cigar-box containing matches. He was apparently
                        paralysed, his head drooping on one side, and his right hand hanging limp.
                        He was shaking all over, and his distressing appearance moved the passers-by
                        to pity.</p>
                    <p>The detective, who had had Smith under observation for several days,
                        described the transformation of the match-seller to a subur- banite renting
                        a villa at £30 a year. In the evening he changed his coppers for silver at
                        Messrs. Salmon and Gluckstein's, and, aided by a conductor, got on to an
                        omnibus, riding to London Bridge Station. There his lameness got much
                        better, and his head became erect, He travelled second-class to the Crystal
                        Pa lace, and usually ran up the station steps two at a time. Then he
                        adjourned to an oyster shop and had an oyster repast. His movements after
                        that became so brisk that the detective had some difficulty in keeping pace
                        with him. Meeting a lady he raised his hat, and with his</p>
                    <p>"paralysed" hand shook hers vigorously. Smith is said to have made £6 a week
                        in the City, and up to Tuesday was drawing weekly pay from the Hearts of Oak
                        Society. He was remanded.</p>

                    <dateline>LONDON, October 28.</dateline>
                    <p>Lord Charles Beresford, with the astonishing luck that has accompanied his
                        whole career, is once more the Man of the Hour. Second son of the fourth
                        Marquess of Waterford, he has | d had five-and-forty years of the sea, has
                        helped to make history at Abou Klea, up the Nile, Metemmeh, and Alexandria,
                        and is still nearly two years short of sixty.</p>
                    <p>It is not by any means certain that he was not at the bottom of the spring
                        cleaning at the Admiralty which has just seen its sequel in the appointment
                        at the head of practical affairs of Sir John Fisher; for when he resigned
                        his Lord Commissionership at the Admiralty by way of protest against a
                        policy of muddle and cheese paring, he gave the Government cause to think
                        hard, and in the end came drastic reform. If Lord Charles was not directly
                        responsible for it, he at any rate hurried it forward by several years.</p>
                    <p>Sir Compton Edward Domvile, K.C.B., who, as Commander-in-Chief of the
                        Mediterranean Fleet at a critical time for this country, be- comes an even
                        more interesting personage than usual, is a Worcestershire man himself, born
                        on a 10th of October, sixty-two years ago, to the late Harry Barry Domvile.
                        But he comes of the Domviles, Barts., of Templeogue and Santry, in the
                        sister kingdom, and is as good an Irish.nan as need be.</p>
                    <p>Not but what there is good English blood in him also. The Irish Domviles get
                        their baptismal Compton through the third wife of the first baronet of a
                        1686 creation. The grantee of that dignity, Sir Thomas, M.P. for 9 County
                        Dublin, took to wife, lastly, Anne, daughter of the Hon. Sir Charles
                        Compton, second son of Spencer, second Earl of t Northampton; and with their
                        son, Sir Compton, second baronet, this baronetcy came to an erd.</p>
                    <p>The estate went to a nephew, Charles Pock- lington, who renounced his own
                        patronymic in favour of his uncle's, and who inherited, besides his uncle's
                        property, the estate of his cousin, Henry Barry, of the Lords Santry now
                        extinct. Three weeks or so before Waterloo the baronetcy was revived for his
                        son, Sir Compton Pock-9 Olington Domvile, who fathered the second and third
                        baronets, and their sister, long known in London Society as the wife of the
                        Danish O Minister, H. E. Torben de Bille. The third baronet married Miss
                        Meade, daughter of the Hon. Robert, of the Clanwilliams, and the present Sir
                        Compton Meade Domvile, fourth T - baronet, is due to their marriage.</p>
                    <p>Sir Compton, the Admiral, wrote himself R.N. at fourteen, and, at twenty, was
                        serving on the Royal yacht. Service of another character he has seen, since,
                        in all parts of the world. In the Mediterranean he is quite at home. He was
                        Second in Command there ten years ago. By the way, in connection with his
                        present t business, it may be recalled that he won his promotion to
                        Commander by his dealings with f certain pirates, who thereafter ceased to
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>So many hostile possibilities which we do not wish to describe s
                        probabilities loom through mists enveloping the future of a con- flict
                        between Great Britain and Russia that the British Government have shown a
                        wise pre- vision in getting the whole of our naval forces at once into a
                        state of thorough preparedness. A comparatively small proportion of these I
                        would be sufficient to deal with the Baltic e fleet or a possible eruption
                        of the Black Sea squadron. But in view of Russia's evident e determination
                        to imperil the peace of the whole t world, in spite of the studied
                        moderation of our attitude hitherto, it would be folly to trust to the
                        localisation of any further conflict.</p>
                    <p>But what are the most likely developments of a war between ourselves and
                        Russia? After the removal of Russia's naval power from the , seas, which we
                        reasonably expect, whether it is destroyed at sea or escapes into neutral
                        ports and is disarmed, the long threatened attack on India is the prospect
                        to which Russian Chauvinists seem to pin their faith. But this first means
                        an advance against the 1. territory of Afghanistan. It is somewhat signifi-
                        cant coincidence, therefore, that the Ameer should lately have displayed an
                        anxiety for closer relations with the Indian Government, and there is every
                        probability that Russia's increasing strength in the direction of Herat has
                        exercised a disturbing effect upon the Moha- medan ruler of Kabul, who would
                        be the first to be sensitive of any augmentation of Musco- vite pressure in
                        Central Asia. It is of good e augury, therefore, that in attempting to
                        strike at India any Russian force would seemingly d have to encounter this
                        formidable and well- armed race of mountaineers in the most difficult <cb

                        cragsman born and bred, a splendid shot, and every bit as courageous as the
                        Japanese. Even if they showed any initial aversion from the entry of their
                        country by an Anglo-Indian Army the Afghans would undoubtedly make their
                        mountains a terribly hot place for their northern invaders.</p>
                    <p>The other contingency which we must look at in considering possibilities of
                        so momentous a character is that Russia may have despaired of success in
                        Manchuria, and may decide to terminate her efforts in that country where she
                        has met with so many disastrous losses, come to terms with Japan, and throw
                        her whole. strength into the Central Asian adventure. There are many
                        Russians with whom the war in the Far East is unpopular, yet who would
                        regard with much more favour an attempt upon India, and it is easy to
                        understand that the desperate gamblers at St. Petersburg might see in a
                        conflict with Great Britain a means of rallying popular sentiment and
                        regaining their damaged ascendancy.</p>
                    <p>An Army Order has been issued directly giving effect to Lord Kitchener's
                        scheme for the redistribution of the Indian Army. Roughly speaking, the
                        order groups the units in the formation in which they can best train in
                        peace for fighting in war. The conditions of the country, it is pointed out,
                        owing to the spread of railways and telegraphs, have vastly changed since
                        the mutiny, when the present location. of troops was arranged.</p>
                    <p>The new scheme concentrates the troops according to present requirements and
                        in par- ticular enables all three armies to be trained together in the
                        various centres. Southern India is by no means denuded of troops, though the
                        post of Lieutenant-General of the Madras Army has been abolished. The
                        military arrangements in Burma remain unchanged. The cost of the changes
                        will, it is believed, amount to £10,000,000 sterling, which will be spread
                        over some years.</p>
                    <p>The death of Field-Marshal Sir Henry Nor- man removes one of the most
                        picturesque and honoured figures among our military veterans. A soldier who
                        had fought at Chillianwallah and lived to serve on the South African War
                        Commission had seen much indeed. It is true that Sir Henry's brilliant
                        services in the field ceased nearly half a century ago, after the Mutiny;
                        but since then his administrative work has been invaluable. It was he who
                        de- vised the scheme that resulted in the creation of the Indian Staff
                        Corps, and thereafter, as one of the governors of India, successively in
                        Calcutta and in London, and as Governor of Jamaica and Queensland, he served
                        the Em- pire well. He might have been Governor- General of India after
                        Queensland had he felt young enough to accept the offer. His may not be a
                        name that will figure in history, but the soldiers and statesmen of his
                        generation, or rather, of his many generations, knew his value,</p>

                    <p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
                    <p>Oranisation of the lottery. The Royal Hungarian Lottery consists of 110,000
                        Tickets of which 55,000 will be drawn with prizes and 1 premium. The tickets
                        bear the Royal Hungarian Arma and an English translation.</p>
                    <p>Drawings. The drawings will take place publicly under the auspices of the
                        Royal Hungarian Government, and in the presence of a State Notary.</p>
                    <p>Drawing Lists. After the drawings the participants will receive an official
                        list of drawn numbers with prizes.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence in English, French, Italian, and all principal languages.</p>
                    <p>The official prospectus will be added to each order and will be sent
                        beforehand on application.</p>
                    <p>Payment of prizes. All prizes are payable after the drawing in each, on
                        returning the drawn ticket. To our foreign correspondents we transmit small
                        prizes by mail, larger amounts will be paid out in cheques by the medium of
                        banking houses in all large towns of the world.</p>
                    <p>N.B. To prevent any misapprehension, arising but too frequently in the public
                        mind, we beg to point out that a winning ticket in the Royal Hungarian
                        Lottery, lawfully acquired and paid for, affords its owner the same
                        guarantee for payment as a banknote issued by the Bank of England.</p>

                    <p>Participation in all Six Drawings.</p>
                    <p>The majority of clients prefer to secure at once the right to paricipate in
                        all of the six drawings, which is judicious considering the appreciation in
                        value from drawing to drawing, and the great advantage offered, especially
                        by the 6th drawing, when the largest prizes and the premium of 600,000
                        crowns are drawn, amounting together to more than ten millions of
                        crowns.</p>
                    <p>In order to enable the purchaser to secure the full advantage thereof, we are
                        prepared to guarantee such participation in all the six drawings against two
                        equal payments: one payment on application, viz:– </p>
                    <p>Crowns 80 84 fr. 3 6/8 for one Whole Ticket.</p>
                    <p>" 40 42 " 1 13/4 " Half "</p>
                    <p>" 20 21 " 0 16/8 " Quarter "</p>
                    <p>And the other before the 5th drawing, but naturally the latter only to be
                        made in case the number of the tivket should not have already won a prize at
                        a previous drawing.</p>
                    <p>Every order must be accompained by its value by money order, which please
                        fill out in Crowns, on receipt of which the desired tickets will be sent by
                        return of mail. If you prefer remitting bank notes, cheques, coupons, etc.,
                        you are requested to have your letter registered.</p>
