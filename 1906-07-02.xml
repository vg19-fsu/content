                    <head>ENGLAND IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>An amusing light on Turkish intrigues in Egypt is thrown by an ingenuously
                        artful letter which has been written to the Editor of the "Standard" by
                        Mustapha Kamel Pacha, and which we reproduce in another column of to-day's
                        issue. Last autumn, it may be remem-bered, the writer was sharply criticised
                        by the Standard's Berlin Correspondent He had been engaged in the patriotic
                        task of trying to induce the German Government to interfere in our
                        management of affairs in the Valley of the Nile. This charge he does not
                        deny (why should he ?), but launches forth into a general defence of the
                        pan-Islamic movement. It is not anti-Christian, he says, but he confesses
                        that it is anti-British. As a matter of fact (as the "Standard" says in
                        commenting on the letter), it is also anti-Christian, but, so far as our
                        immediate duty goes, it is enough that the agitation is being conducted
                        against our authority in Cairo. Mustapha Kamel Pacha tells us that we
                        promised to evacuate the country and have not redeemed our pledge. Well,
                        whose fault is that? In 1887 a distinct and definite offer was made by Lord
                        Salisbury to the Porte, but the Turks refused on the ground that we claimed
                        the right of returning in case of disorder being revived. The Turks had no
                        use for Egypt except as field far peculation, and Sir Henry Wolff's mission
                        came to an end. It is surprising that a man of the world like Mastapha Kamel
                        Pacha—not to say a cosmopolitan—should think he is doing any good to the
                        Sultan by talking about British neglect of the "rights of the Egyptians."
                        What Egyptians ? Mastapha Kamel Pacha is concerned, not for the Fellaheen,
                        but for the Turks, who are no longer allowed to prey upon them. He is sorry
                        for the tigers who have no Christians to eat! The deliver-ance of the Sadan
                        from the Mahdi's oppres-sion is represented as another wrong to an oppressed
                        nationality. We have wrenched it, he says, from the Egyptians ! Does he
                        believe that English readers of newspapers are so hopelessly ignorant as to
                        believe that the Mahdi was a patriotic Prince fighting in the national cause
                        ? What, we should like to ask, would have become of Mastapha Kamel Pacha and
                        other semi-civilised Turks if the Khalifa had made his way to Cairo and, to
                        put the matter gently, "assumed the direction of affairs"? He and his
                        brethren, as representing a slightly higher stage of oulture, would have
                        been sold into slavery, unless they had been executed off the spot. Is it a
                        change of masters that he sighs for ? If the Germans or French had
                        undertaken the control of Egypt, does he suppose that he would have been
                        permitted to indite letters of free criticism to the Berlin or Paris Press ?
                        He laughs to scorn the suggestion that in demanding the other day the
                        withdrawal of Turkish troops from Tabah we were defending Egypt. What else,
                        then, were we doing! We were preventing the Saltan's agents from carry-ing
                        out their plan tor reabsorbing the Khe-dive's dominions. This, no doubt,
                        concludes our London contemporary, was inconrenient for the Turkish
                        place-hunters and concession-mongers. But it saved Egypt from a renewal of
                        the oppressions and exactions under which it laboured so long as it was
                        governed by Turkish adventurers.</p>

                    <p>Jerusalem, June 29.</p>
                    <p>The Boundary Commission arrived at Rafah yesterday and after a stay of three
                        days will proceed to El-Arish, whence they will embark for Port Said. It
                        appears that the demarcation of the boundary line from Akaba to El-Rafah has
                        been satisfactorily marked out. Ssveral military posts will be established
                        by Turkey along the frontier.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the Frontier Commission will remain for the present at
                        Rafah, where the final disoussions between the delegates appointed by the
                        respective Governments will be held. z</p>
                    <p>The Constantinople Correspondent of the "Petit Parisien"learns that the
                        method to be adopted by the Turkish Commissioners with regard to the
                        disputed boundary line between Egypt and Turkey is as follows: The
                        commissioners will take the declaration of the wandering tribes as to
                        whether such territory is Turkish or Egyptian to the exclusion of all maps
                        and geographical configuration, This method of inquiry from the wandering
                        Bedouin tribes was adopted by the Turks when the boundary pillars
                        disappeared near El Arish, at the Mediterranean end of the boundary line.
                        They induced several sheikhs in the south of Palestine to declare that the
                        pillars in question did not mark the boundary. Similar success would no
                        doubt attend their efforts on the present occasion, but Major Owen and
                        Ibrahim Fathi Pash*, who are acting for Egypt, will have something to say to
                        this transparent triok.</p>

                    <p>Mr. C. J. Alford, in a voluminous report, once pointed out that the tradition
                        of the existence of coal or carboniferous deposits in the valley of the Nile
                        had been extant for many years, and that about 70 years ago a party of
                        Frenchmen found some deposits of coal or lignite in the Wady Keneh, about 18
                        miles north-west of Keneh town. Subsequently to the issue of this report,
                        and largely on the advice of Jehu son Pacha, whose long residence in and
                        acquaintance with the country entitles him to be considered an expert on all
                        questions a Quoting the industrial resources of Egypt, a syndicate was
                        formed to take over a total area of about 12,000 square miles of what were
                        believed to be coal-bearing lands. Some of these lands are situated in the
                        Sinai peninsula, whence it is stated that coal and lignite have often been
                        brought to Suez. Those who are interested in the commercial development of
                        Egypt would like to know what progress the syndicate has made in the way of
                        getting saleable coal to bank. The importance of properly operated coal
                        mines to the country is incalculable, and one would be glad to hear that the
                        syndicate had realised the anticipations ot those who originally formed it.

                    <p>Mustapha Pacha Kamel writes as follows to the London "Standard" :—</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I read the message of yonr Berlin Correspondent concerning my visit to
                        the capital of Germany last autumn, and my interviews with her diplomatists.
                        So I desired to furnish him here with answers of his involved questions in
                        that message, and to repudiate some of the false reports which appeared in
                        the English papers about me and my country.</p>
                    <p>I had not called upon Constantinople last autumn as was reported by your
                        Berlin Correspondent, and had not conferred with one of the German
                        diplomatists on "Sinai question," for I did not contemplate that such a
                        question would be existed before the diplomatic world.</p>
                    <p>I also believed, and still believe, that Turkey was not clearing the ground
                        for this emergency before its issue,as was claimed by some writers. My visit
                        to Berlin was confined to interviews and parleys on different topics. It is
                        true that I expressed my astonishment at the support given by Germany to
                        England in Egypt, and her aid to the British occupation from the beginning
                        till the present time, although she proclaimed, and still proclaims, that
                        she sympathises with Moslems and desires to gain their friendship and good
                        will. The declaration of these ideas and my defending the rights of my
                        country, can not be regarded by the just as intriguing.</p>
                    <p>Plotting is not my characteristic, nor, I believe, that it is in the interest
                        of my Country.</p>
                    <p>All English papers had committed many Units in diverse matters concerning
                        Egypt and her people. They stated that the anti-English movement in Egypt is
                        an Islamic activity which has in view the persecution of the Christians in
                        general. This is a very great misapprehension and an awful charge, which we
                        can not accept at all. We Egyptians know Islamism in its true sense. We know
                        very well that it is the religion of progress, justice and civilisation and
                        that the Christians live in great security under its rule. We know that the
                        easiest path to rise and advance the Moslem nations is to go back to the
                        trne principles of Islam and its sound rales, which were the sole cause of
                        the supremacy of Moslems in the past centuries.</p>
                    <p>The European Press err so much by saying that Pan-Islamism tends to waging
                        destructive wars between the Moslems and Christians. Pan-Islamism is but a
                        natural bond which binds Mahometans with each other through the obligations
                        and sanctions of our religion. It has for its end their progress and
                        ascendancy by means of similar methods and measures. For the causes of their
                        backward state are the same. Those are who animated by a trne love to see
                        the human race enjoying with prosperity ought to welcome the movement—Pan
                        Islamism— which t nds to 300,000,000 human beings, with much pleasure.</p>
                    <p>I am of opinion that those who say that this movement is against the
                        civilisation, mislead others and attack civilisation itself. Civilisation
                        involves in its wider sense the prosperity and progress of mankind in
                        general and not the progress of one race to the disadvantage of another, nor
                        the ascendancy of some nations over the others but it implies the respect of
                        the rights and honours of all nations and the individuals in general. The
                        hatred with which the Egyptians are animated towards the British occupation
                        is natural. The effects of this hatred were very clear in many
                        occasions.</p>
                    <p>Those who are holding the reins of the English politics are held responsible
                        for that hatred and are its true cause. For they failed to fulfil their
                        promises that were given publicly before the world at large in connection of
                        the evacuation of Egypt. They established the English occupation without any
                        recognised right. Their ambition was not satisfied by such encroachments;
                        but they had gone further. They stood against the rights of the Egyptians
                        and their desires and robbed them every power or authority in their country.
                        They confused the education system in Egypt and moulded it in a very bad
                        style. They waged destructive wars against the poor classes—the largest
                        classes—by means of clearing their sons of the Government schools. The
                        Britisher who is astonished at such sentiments which animate the Egyptians
                        may ask himself, "What would he do if England were occupied by a foreign
                        Power which follows the same course and attitude followed by the English in
                        Egypt!!!"</p>
                    <p>Of course the partisans of the English Occupation in Egypt say that it had
                        enjoyed prosperity and wealth in the days of this occupation Although the
                        most benefited by that wealth and prosperity are the outsiders, we publicly
                        declare thart wealth does not make the wise forget this country and the
                        dearness of its supremacy. So we prefer poverty accompanied by independence
                        to riches combined with occupation,</p>
                    <p>The English papers expressed much surprise at the love and sympathy shown
                        towards Turkey by the Egyptians. There is no reason for such astonishment at
                        all. For Turkey, in spite of the Islamic ties which hind us with her had
                        respected autonomy tince; it had been conferred by her upon Egypt up to the
                        present time. It had widened its circle in the days of Ismail Pacha instead
                        of attacking it. Her respect to the independence of Egypt had gone more
                        further. She refused to accept what was proposed by the Europe daring
                        Arahy's revolution that she may send a Tuikish army to occupy the Nile
                        Valley, and put an end to that rising. Had Turkey complied with that
                        proposal, she would have served herself and Egypt by securing her
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>Her refusal indicates that she respects so much the independence of Egypt.
                        But England had destroyed that independence by every means in her power, and
                        wrested the Sudan from the Egyptians, for the recovery of which they had
                        sacrified much blood and money. She favoured the Italians with Mosawa,
                        Zeila, and Herar.</p>
                    <p>How then can any one require us not to hate the English occupation ? How can
                        we believe the nonsense which appears in the leased Press by the English
                        which say that England was defending Egypt in Tabah question ?</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The terrible outrage against British officere still forms a prominent
                        topic of conversation throughout Egypt, and now is the time when the
                        prevention of similar occurrences in the future should be discussed, and the
                        voice of the thinking public heard.</p>
                    <p>The severity of the sentences which were passed upon those who were found
                        guilty ot taking a leading part in the attack will doubtless serve as a
                        deterrent for some time to come, and, I trust, we shall hear of no farther
                        similar incident either in the near or remote future. We cannot, however,
                        close our eyes to the fact that this occurrence is an exceptionally painful
                        illustration of the lawlessness and-even savagery of certain sections of the
                        fellaheen. In some districts the fellah is a hard working, law-abiding man
                        who only concerns himself with the fruitful labouring of his land. In many
                        districts, however, and chiefly in the provinces ot Menoufieh, Behera, and
                        the Fayonm, he has shown himself to be revengeful and criminal and he does
                        not hesitate to commit murder, devastate his enemies' crops, or slaughter
                        his cattle. The only punishment, save death, now inflioted for such crimes
                        is imprisonment, and with such characters this fails to serve its end. A
                        correspondent whom you sent to inquire into the facts of the attack on
                        British officers at Denishwai remarked that the villagers are wont to use
                        the taunt, "You've never been in prison." Imprisonment ot such people is but
                        giving them food and lodging free with probably less bard labour than they
                        are accustomed to in their fields. For them incarceration holds no shame,
                        nor do they lose by it, for their families carry on their work. The
                        infliction of fines is useless as it bat results in imprisonment owing to
                        the refusal of the fellah to part with the smallest sum of money.</p>
                    <p>It is necessary, therefore, that in order to suppress the far too rampant
                        criminality of certain villages in Egypt, some other form of punishment be
                        made legal, and there only remains, as far as I can see, the re-institution
                        of corporal punishment. The certain knowledge that the commission of a crime
                        would entail the infiotion of severe bodily pain is the only thing which
                        could make the criminal stay his hand. He fears this above all others,
                        except the extreme penalty of death, and if corporal punishment were again
                        made law we should see a rapid decrease in crime.</p>
                    <p>It also behoves the Egyptian Government to enforce severe punishment for
                        perjury. The commission of peijury is so common that it is almost safe to
                        say that no case in which natives are concerned is heard without witnesses
                        perjuring themselves. The evidence of the cubashi of police at the trial at
                        Chibin el Korn is a proved example of the perjury of native witnesses, and
                        very many others might be quoted. Let the punishment for perjury be made
                        severe and the prosecution of those who bear false witness be strenuously
                        carried out and it will then In found that the work of the judges will be
                        greatly simplified and the just sentencing of the guilty far more certain.—I

                    <p>An unpleasant story comes from Menoufieh, where a British official

                        were painful if not dangerous. It appears that a sheikh who was accompanying
                        the official did hot dare to give him the names of the fellaheen involved or
                        of the village to which they belonged.</p>

                        <p>The rather sudden departure of the Khedive from Stamboul is attributed in
                            various quar ters to the peculiar action of the Tarkish authorities in
                            having stopped work on the palace which His Highness is having built at
                            Tchiboukli, on the Asiatic shore of the Bospborns. All the workmen
                            engaged thereon have been dismissed, on the pretext of not being
                            provided with tezkerehs.</p>
                        <p>Several European journals have invented a number of stories to explain
                            the real motive of the Turks. One is strangely ingenious, if not
                            fascinating. It is that the Khedive intended storing cannon in this
                            palace, and setting up a Marconi plant which, via a castle on the Isle
                            of Prinkipo, would communicate secretly with the British' warships off
                            the Dardanelles.</p>
                        <p>But that the Porte is vexed with the African Vilayet there is no denying,
                            for the other day the Greek news sheet, the "Constantinople," was closed
                            by censorial o-der for presuming to advertise the Anglo-Egyptian Bank's
                            agency, to be shortly installed in Galata. "Anglo-Egyptian" is a term
                            which, like the incabus of nightmare, troubles the slumber of the Turk.
                            It is like the early Egyptian cnonmberi— indigestible.</p>

                            through his clumsy modus procedendi at Akaba, which has cost him more
                            than even a military defeat. The British Government had thus far

                        <p>Dear Sir,—In your yesterday' s extract from the "Globe," I note with some
                            amusement the designation of "trumpery" as applied to the Kntzo Vlaoh
                            Question. The "Globe" is wrong in making such a statement. The Kutzo
                            Vlaoh Question is at the basis of the present split between Roamania and
                            her National Charob, on the one hand, and Greece and the Greek National
                            Church on the other.</p>
                        <p>Church politics are the ruling factors in Macedon to-day as they were
                            under Basil the Bulgar slayer, and had your contemporary the "Globe" a
                            Nearer insight into the situation, as it is, in the three vilayets, it
                            would never have made such an assertion. The bloodless conflict between
                            the Northern and Southern Kingdoms dates simultaneously with the schism
                            of the Kutzo Vlaoh community from the Greek Church of Constantinople,
                            and it was the breaking off of relations between the Phanar and the
                            Roumanian Government which brought on the present one-sided strife. M.
                            Skouzea and his compeers, with the subtility of Greek diplomacy,
                            naturally affect an utter astonishment at the irreconciliable attitude
                            of the Roumanian Government, which they pretend not to understand. But
                            if the truth be known it is the creation of a semi-autonomous community
                            sympathetic with Roumanian aspirations in Macedonia which is
                            objectionable to Hellas' dream of a Greek Principality in the home of
                            Alexander the Great. Peace can only be restored by the intermediation of

                    <p>A very pleasant game was played at the Soldiers' Clnb, Cairo, on Wednesday

                        points. We congratulate this sporting battalion on seoaring the 1st prize in
                        this competition, as also the one for the lance corporals and privates, the

                            <p>The O'Conor Don is dead. (Reuter.</p>
                            <p>The Right Hon. Charles Owen O'Conor, the O'Conor Don, was born at
                                Dublin on May 7, 183 , being the eldest son of the late Denis
                                O'Conor Doc. His family was of noble and ancient descent, being
                                derived from the O'Coners of Connaught,' who gave Ireland her last
                                independent sovereign, Rody O'Conor, who was compelled to pay
                                tribute to the Norman invaders. Educated at St Gregory's College,
                                Downside, and later at London University, he entered Parliament as
                                Liberal member for Roscommon in 1860 and retained his sent till
                                1880, when he was defeated by a Nationalist candidate He was
                                opposed,though not bitterly opposed,to the Na tionalist movement,
                                but the Land League and its supporters found in him a stubborn
                                antagonist. He contested Wexford in 1883 and failed and afterwards
                                made no farther attempt to enter Parliament. He had, however, done
                                good work during his career in the House. He passed the Irish
                                Industrial Schools Act in 1868, the Irish Sunday Closing Act in
                                1879, was a member of • the Penal Servitude Acts Commission in 1863,
                                of the Factories and Workshops Commission in 1875, of the
                                Registration of Deeds Commission in 1878, and the Land Law
                                Commission in 1880. In 1862 he was a member of the Reformatories and
                                Industrial Schools Commission and in 1896 was appointed Chairman of
                                the Commission which studied the Financial Relations between Great
                                Britain and Ireland. Of attractive presence and stately manners, he
                                was a fine type of the old Catholic aristocracy of Ireland, now
                                almost extinct. He wrote a valuable history of the O'Conor clan and
                                numerous essays on Irish land tenure, taxation, etc. He was twice
                                mar­ried and leaves three sons.</p>

                            <p>The American boat express from Plymouth was derailed at Salisbury, on
                                the London and South Western Railway, early this morning. 24 persons
                                were killed, almost all Americans, and a dozen injured. There were
                                47 passengers travelling by the train. The engine left the rails
                                passing the points and crashed into the guard's van of a milk train,
                                killing the guard. It dashed over the girders of a railway bridge
                                and turned turtle. Three coaches were totally smashed and the killed
                                horribly mangled, including the driver and stoker.</p>
                            <p>Several prominent Americans on board the liner from New York had

                    <p>(From a "Daily Telegraph" Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>It is my belief that whenever the history of Egypt daring the British
                        occupation is written by an impartial historian, the commencement of an era
                        of material prosperity, hitherto un­known in the Valley of the Nile, will be
                        dated from the year 1898. In that year an agree- was come to between the
                        Egyptian Govern­ment and a British syndicate, by which the latter engaged to
                        construct the Assouan Dam. Even if this great work had proved a signal
                        failure instead, as the result has shown, of a brilliant success, the bare
                        fact that British capitalists had made up their minds to risk an immense sum
                        of money on an enterprise calculated to render the water supply of the Nile
                        regular instead of intermittent was regarded throughout Egypt as conclusive
                        evi­dence that England intended to make her occupation permanent instead of
                        temporary. No doubt shrewd observers had long before this date arrived at a
                        like conclusion. Bat the Egyptians, though shrewd enough about their own
                        affairs and interests, are utterly incapable of understanding the complex
                        con­siderations which govern the action and the policy of any British
                        Government, no matter what may be the party in office.</p>
                    <p>It was not therefore till the construction of the Assouan Dam was undertaken
                        by British capitalists, with the avowed approval of Great Britain, and with
                        the warm support of the British authorities in Egypt, that the Egyptian
                        public realised that whatever might have been her professions or her
                        promises, England had "come to stay." How far this discovery was welcome in
                        itself may be open to discussion, but there can he no question that it gave
                        the agricultural population of Egypt a sense of security which they had
                        never possessed so long as they imagined the British occupation might prove
                        as evanescent as it had been unex­pected. Whatever the like or dislike of
                        the natives may have been to the system of admi­nistration we had introduced
                        into Egypt, they knew that under our rule they need have no fear about
                        disclosing any means they might possess. The enormous majority of the
                        Egyptian population are either landowners or live in one form or another
                        upon the lands they till. From the pashas and large landowners down to the
                        humblest fellah, who toils from dawn to night in raising water by hand-drawn
                        backet to irrigate his little patch of land, every native felt instinctively
                        that if the authority of Great Britain was to be permanent he need entertain
                        no fear of showing himself richer than he was thought to be by his
                        neighbors. All over the country hoards of money, which had been con­cealed
                        for years, if not for generations, were suddenly brought to light, while the
                        rul­ing passion of every Egyptian, from the highest to the lowest, was to
                        add to the number of his fields. This being so, the prices of land began
                        suddenly to rise. For instance, within a few weeks of the dam being
                        commenced land in Upper Egypt rose in price from £10 the feddan, or acre, to
                        £40 ; and though this rise was naturally greater in the localities where the
                        supply of water had hitherto been deficient, a gradual, though less rapid,
                        rise took place in every province, from Assouan to the Delta. The general
                        extent of this rise may be best estimated by this fact, that while as late
                        as 1888 it was calculated by official experts on the value of land that the
                        Daira Sanieh Estates, which had been surrendered by Ismail Pacha and his
                        children in order to raise the Daira Sanieh loan of £8,000,000, would barely
                        suffiae to pay off the loan under the most favourable conditions, yet the
                        final sale of those estates in 1905 not only repaid the bondholders in fall,
                        bat left a net surplus of from £6,000,000 to £7,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The sadden accession to the liquid assets of Egypt gave birth to two
                        movements, which have materially contributed to the develop­ment of the
                        country. The fellaheen did not alter their mode of life to any material
                        extent in consequence of their newly-displayed wealth. They are certainly
                        better fed and somewhat less poorly dressed, but they continue the same
                        laborious, frugal lives they have led for centuries. Their only extravagance
                        has been in the purchase of larger and better lands. For the first time the
                        fellaheen have become open buyers of land whenever an estate came into open
                        market, and* it is their competition which has run up the price of land, as
                        it fetches much more if sold in small lots than when sold in large blocks.
                        It is astonishing how high the fellaheen will down bid, and in consequence
                        the number of petty landowners who cultivate their own lands by their own
                        labour is increasing rapidly. In itself this movement is matter for
                        congratulation, especially as Egypt, of all countries with which I am
                        acquainted, is the one where the system of petite culture can be tried with
                        much chance of success. I am assured by all the land­owners I know that the
                        fellaheen makes a greater profit out of his lands by manual labour than the
                        most grasping of landlords— even if he should be a Copt - can ever make by
                        hired labour. Indeed, I should regard this dispersion of large estates in
                        Egypt amidst small holders as an unmixed benefit if the fellah purchased his
                        new lends out of his own pocket. In ninety oases, however, out of a hundred
                        he raises the major amount of the <cb n="4"/>purchase money by loans
                        contracted by the Greek village moneylender, at exorbitant rates of
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>Even the Agricultural Bank of Egypt, which was specially established under
                        the patronage of the Khedivial Government in order to free the fellaheen
                        from extortion, charges 9 per cent, as its minimum rate of interest, yet,
                        though this rate is infinitely lower than those charged by the local banks
                        and by the land mortgage companies, the fellaheen, as a body, still prefer
                        the village usurer, who, in con­sideration of the large interest he charges,
                        will give the borrower time to pay, and does not sell him up at once if he
                        happens to get into default I cannot see myself how the fellaheen can
                        possibly make a sufficient profit, even out of good land, to enable him to
                        get a living for himself and to pay interest upon two- thirds or three
                        fourths of the purchase money at from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent. If he has
                        done so hitherto, this has only been due to the very high price of the
                        cotton crop; and if there should be any serious fell in this price the
                        fellaheen, 1 am convinced, will, as a body, make default in pay­ment, the
                        banks and financial institutions will forthwith call in their overdrafts,
                        and there will be a "very bad quarter of an hour" for the borrowers. I am
                        assured, however, by persons who speak with authority on these subjects that
                        any serious fall in the price of cotton is very improbable, and that even if
                        it should occur, and if the banks should call in their loans in consequence,
                        the Government would be com­pelled to take steps to hinder any wholesale
                        eviction of the small fellaheen landowners. I. am not myself fully satisfied
                        with these assur­ances; but I am bound to say that local autho­rities do not
                        anticipate any sudden fall in the present prices of land in Egypt. Moreover,
                        there is this to be borne in mind. Even if a sudden "slump" should arise in
                        the value of agricultural land its immediate effect would be to ruin a very
                        large number of small holders who have borrowed money they could not afford
                        to repay, and would thus become dispos­sessed of their lands ; but the
                        intrinsic value of these lauds would remain the same, and pay the same
                        land-tax as at present, so that the country as a whole would not he affected
                        by any changes in the proprietorship. </p>
                    <p>A similar statement cannot be made, if my view is correct, with regard to the
                        second cause of the present inflated prosperity—the sadden and extraordinary
                        rise in the value of town building lots throughout Egypt. Owing to the
                        general increase of wealth and to a conviction that this wealth may nowadays
                        he displayed with impunity, the well-to do classes, unlike the fellaheen,
                        are changing their modes of life. Instead of concealing their command of
                        money they indulge in hitherto unaccustomed luxu­ries and become large
                        purchasers of foreign wares, a fact which accounts for the extraordi­nary
                        increase in the imports daring the last few years. The imports have
                        gradually risen in value, till they almost surpass the exports. This change
                        may possibly prove detrimental here­after to the financial position of
                        Egypt, but its immediate effect has been to cause an extraor­dinary rise in
                        the value of building sites. Within the last few years the class of
                        landowners, whose income is not derived from manual labour, have adopted the
                        custom of having houses in the town as well as in the country. The necessary
                        result has been a sudden demand for town pro­perties, and a rapid rise in
                        the values of such properties. The first thing which strikes any traveller
                        who, like myself, knew Egypt well in the days before the British occupation,
                        is the transformation which has taken place in what we should call the
                        roadside towns, hut which •—as there are still no roads in Egypt—must, I
                        suppose, be described as the railway and river-side towns. Everywhere one
                        sees new and handsome stone houses replacing the old lath and plaster
                        tenements, and even the mud-built hats of my early recollections. If you
                        enter these towns you will find fairly good hotels, rows of flourishing
                        shops, which have displaced the old windowless mud hovels, where the
                        mer­chant sold his wares in the open-air ; and com- fortable carriages
                        plying for hire in the streets. To some extent this is accounted for by the
                        development of the railway system, and the great increase in the number of
                        tourists, but it is mainly due to the constant immigration of well-to-do
                        natives from the countryside into the towns. </p>
                    <p>I am told on all sides that the main cause of this immigration is usual in
                        domestic matters all over the world—the influence of women. The ladies of
                        the harem are determined to have residences in the towns, and as usual,
                        their lordsand masters have succumbed to their predominant partners. To me,
                        as an outsider, it is not very intelligible why ladies who, in town or
                        country, reside, or are supposed to reside, within the harem, should attach
                        much import­ance as to whether the harem is situated in the former rather
                        than in the latter. In the East, however, as in the West, it is useless for
                        a mere man to investigate the workings of the female intellect. If it is
                        difficult to argue with one wife, it is still more difficult to argue with
                        four legal wives, supposing they all happen to be of one mind, and a wise
                        husband, in Africa as in Europe, gives way for the sake of peace to the
                        wishes of the harem, whether monogamous or poly­gamous.</p>
                    <p>The inmates of the harem naturally prefer the capital to any provincial town,
                        and I have no doubt the wealthy landowners, if they have any choice in the
                        matter, however much they may dislike quitting their country homes, where
                        they could look after their lands, are less reluctant to take up their
                        abodes in the metropolis. For them, at any rate, Cairo has many attractions
                        of a personal, political, or social character, far greater than those
                        offered by the large provincial cities, such as Tantab, Zagazig,
                        Mansourab,or D&amp;manhonr, not to mention a score of others. Be this at it
                        may, the exodus from the country has been mainly, though no <cb n="5"/>be
                        any means exclusively, directed to the capital. This exodus, commenced at
                        least a dozen years ago, has gone on increas­ing year by year, and up to
                        date has shown no sign of diminution At the outset the new houses required
                        by the newcomers, Levantines as well as Mussulmans, were built to order, the
                        builders having first satisfied them­selves as to the requisite funds being
                        duly forth­coming. In so far as I can learn, what I may call speculative
                        building only commenced about two or three years ago. New quarters of the
                        town sprang up in the direction of the Abas- sieh and of Ghezireh. The price
                        of land rose by leaps and bounds, and landowners, builders, contractors,
                        upholsterers, and architects amassed large fortunes without incurring any
                        serious risk of loss. The process of housebuilding con­tinued with such
                        unchecked rapidity that the day seemed near at hand when no building ground
                        could be found within the existing confines of the city. It was then that
                        the era of speculative building commenced in earnest. </p>
                    <p>Cairo proper is practically confined between the Nile on the west and the
                        Mokattam range of hills on the east. The site lying between these two
                        boundaries is already covered by dwellings. The principal spaces left
                        untouched for building purposes were roughly the desert land lying along the
                        plain, across which the old railway ran from Cairo to Suez, in the days of
                        the overland mail, and the partially culti­vated land about Ghizeb, on the
                        western banks of the Nile. When I returned to Cairo last November, after two
                        years' absence, I found Cairo in the course of reconstruction. The Ismailieh
                        and Kasr el-Doubara quarters were built over up to the hilt. Everywhere
                        whole streets of houses, which were quite new in 1903, were being pulled
                        down in order to make room for new houses with additional storeys. To an old
                        visitor like myself, who remembers the time when the desert commenced at the
                        back of the then New Hotel, and when the Esbekieh gardens, now the
                        Continental Hotel, were a sort of no man's land, haunted by pariah dogs, the
                        city has lost much of its Oriental character. I coaid say a great deal more
                        about the disfiguration of Cairo and especially about the enormity of
                        building huge flats of many- storeyed buildings, shutting out the light and
                        air from the streets in which they stand; but I am writing about Cairo, not
                        from an artistic, but from a business point of view; and I must admit that
                        if l had owned landed pro­perty in the city the certainty of being able to
                        sell it at a fabulous profit would have conso­led me to a large extent for
                        the desecration of a city which is to me almost a second home.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
