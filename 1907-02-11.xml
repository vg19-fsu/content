                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S DRINKING WATER.</head>
                    <p>"The Filtration Works for supplying the , Town of Alexandria with Potable
                        Water" is the subject of an interesting but highly technical pao|phlet by
                        Mr. H. R. C. Blagdon, manager of the Alexandria Water Company.</p>
                    <p>The completion of the filtration works described in this paper marks an
                        import ant epoch in the modern history of Alexandria, and even of Egypt, as
                        the works are the first of their kind in the country, and Alexandria is the
                        first town in Egypt to be supplied with an efficient and up-to-date
                        filtration-system for its water-supply.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blagden gives a very complete account of the installation and expresses
                        his satisfaction with the Jewell filters</p>
                    <p>It | will be remembered that in September, j 1 the Water Company and the
                        Municipality jointly were approached by the Jeweli Export Filter Company of
                        New York, with a view to the introduction of their system <cb n="6"/> of
                        rapid sand-filtration, but at first the suggestion was received with a good
                        deal of opposition, not only because the slow sand-system had been
                        practically decided upon, but also because the Water Company and the
                        Municipality together had already spent some years in carrying out
                        experiments on this system with some small settling-tanks and biters which
                        had been specially made for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>The Jewell Filter Company, however, gave extremely favourable guarantees as
                        to 't;.e saving in first cost of the new works by the adoption of their
                        system, and also the higher efficiency of their filters as compared with
                        that which probably would be obtained with the slow sand-filters; they were
                        further prepared to substantiate their guarantees by erecting, on their own
                        responsibility and at their own expense, in Alexandria, near the Water
                        Company's intake on the Mahmoudieh Canal, a complete model plant,
                        includingpomps, settlingtanks, and one Jewell gravity-filter capable of
                        delivering 22,400 gallons of filtered water in 24 hours This plant was
                        actually delivered in the following October, and the ultimate result of the
                        trials was that these filters were selected.</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt, says Mr. Blagden, that, for a town like Alexandria,
                        which is unfortunately occasionaliyGvisited by an epidemic of cholera, the
                        Jewell system of filtration presents many great advantages over the slow
                        sand-system.</p>
                    <p>It requires only about one-sixth of the area of the ground required for the
                        same daily output by the slow sandsystem.</p>
                    <p>The cleaning out and washing of the filters ia done entirely mechanically,
                        without any handling whatever and without any man coming in contact with the
                        filtering-sand, whereas in the slow sand-system at least thirty men would be
                        employed in scraping the' top layer of sand in fcffe filters for cleaning
                        purposes, and in times of epidemic there would be considerable risk of
                        infecting the filters ; anyone who is acquainted with the extremely
                        insanitary habits of the natives will thoroughly appreciate this point.</p>
                    <p>The Jewell filters are contained in a covered house, and are not exposed to
                        the hot ^un and dust ; this is an important point inEgyj^t, where
                        masonic-work, especially cement, deteriorates and cracks very rapidly from
                        exposure to the sun, and requires constant repairs ; all the valves and
                        automatic regulating-apparatus are also within the filter-house, and
                        consequently can be easily kept clean, besides being far less liable to get
                        out of order.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the washing of the filters can be easily done by one nrwfr, each
                        filter occupying only 5 minutes per day in cleaning, and not only the top
                        ayer of the filter, but the whole bed of sand, is cleaned at each washing ;
                        the Jewell filter is also in itself an ideal sand-washing machine.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, it can be justly claimed for the Jewell filter that it possesses an
                        almost ideal regulator for the speed of filtration, and for the pressure;
                        the How of filtered water is absolutely constant during the entire run, and
                        the diagram of pressure is perfectly regular, as has been shown by constant
                        experiment.</p>
                    <p>This is a most important fact, as it is well known that the perfect working
                        of a sand-filter depends entirely upon the constancy of the rate of
                        filtration and the regularity of the increase of pressure.</p>
                    <p>The Weston automatic controller on the outlet likewise has the advantage that
                        the rate of filtration, in case of necessity, can be changed in a few
                        minutes ; this is of great importance in the event of a sudden demand for an
                        abnormal quantity of filtered water, due to an outbreak of fire or other
                        cause.</p>
                    <p>The results, given by Mr. Blagden, leave no room for doubt as to the
                        efficiency of the method of sedimentation and filtration ; the action of the
                        alumina in the settling-tanks is most marked, and it has been found when
                        cleaning out the settling-tanks that the amount of deposit remaining in the
                        first compartment of the settling-tanks was nearly five times that in the
                        second compartment, showing that the time allowed for sedimentation, which
                        at present is 7 to 9 hours, is amply sufficient.</p>
                    <p>The percentage removal of bacteria from the raw water is distinctly high, and
                        exceeds the guarantee of the Jewell Filter Company ; the daily averages are
                        very uniform, and never since the first month of the filter's working has
                        the removal of bacteria been le9s than 98 per cent.</p>

                            murder of thegent of Boghos Pasha Nubar near Damanhou. On the night of
                            the tragedy the victim was sitting in his house surrounded by his family
                            at the time of his death and was actually playing with his youngest
                            child, whom he was dandling on his knee. Suddenly the repeat of firearms
                            was heard, and he received two bullets in his head. The murderers
                            demped. On the following morning, the modir and the niabeh left for the
                            scene of the tragedy and after a careful enquiry two Arenians were
                            arrested. On Saturday Mourees Be left for the ezbet accompanied by the
                            two accessed, whom he ultimately released as no pro of their guilt could

                    <p>The Reported Raids.</p>
                    <p>We understand that there is no foundation in the report that the Egyptian
                        Bedouins have suffered from Turkish attacks in the frontier district. The
                        Awakir tribe, who inhabit the hinterland of Barka, have undoubtedly
                        committed depredations on the Bedouins who are under Egyptian rule, but
                        there is no reason whatever to suppose that the Turkish Government is in any
                        way responsible for the acts of this lawless and turbulent tribe and its
                        chief, Sheikh Abdel Kader el Kozza.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that the commission which left yesterday for Benghazi, and which
                        includes representatives of the aggrieved tribe, will make a satisfactory
                        settlement of the questions at issue between the Egyptians and the Tripoli
                        Bedouins. The Turkish authorities are certainly most unlikely to put any
                        difficulties in their way.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Gould announced the resignation of Miss Waeber from the post of matron on
                        account of ill health, and in a few well chosen words recalled the devoted
                        services which Miss Waeber had rendered to the Home during her four years'
                        tenure of office, during which time the Home had very greatly improved in
                        efficiency. He pointed out that Miss Waeber possessed all the qualities
                        required in a matron, and added that she takes with her in her retirement
                        the very highest appreciation of her services by the committee.</p>
                    <p>A vote of thanks to Miss Waeber for her very valuable services was
                        unanimously accorded, and the meeting terminated with a vote of thanks to
                        the chairman.</p>

                    <p>As was to be expected, the subscription for shares in Caffari's Co-operative
                        Markets has proved a great success, the amount offered to the public having
                        been covered several times over during Friday and Saturday. In fact, so many
                        have been the applications that the directors have generously consented to
                        allot some of the shares they had reserved for themselves.</p>
                    <p>We mentioned in a former issue of our paper the many advantages offered to
                        the public in dealing with these stores. The foremost is the convenience of
                        being able, by one walk through the extensive premises in Sharia
                        Kasr-el-Nil, to procure all one's household requirements in one place and,
                        what is still more important, be sure of getting everything of the best
                        quality and at the most moderate price.</p>
                    <p>The career of the founder of this business is a striking example of what can
                        he accomplished by dint of hard work combined with perseverance and strict
                        integrity. Mr. J. B. Caffari began his career in this country as a broker on
                        the Alexandria Bourse in 1881 in conjunction with the late Mr. Camilleri. In
                        the following year he became agent in Egypt for Messrs. Butler amp Co., army
                        contractors, afterwards known as Butler and Bencini. He remained with this
                        firm until 1846 when he started business in this city on his own account and
                        the next year opened branches in Cairo and Crete. The business in Cairo
                        increased so rapidly that Mr. Caffari found it neccesary to remove in 1903
                        from the Esbekieh quarter to the present premises in Sharia Kasr-el-Nil,
                        which were considerably enlarged last year, and the daily sales of the
                        establishment have now attained no less than £50, which can be considered a
                        record figure for a concern of his description in Egypt. Like most of the
                        world's big stores, this one aslo started with modest beginnings, and as we
                        mentioned before, owes its marvellous success to the one great principle,
                        initated by the late Mr. Whiteley, of Westbourne Grove fame, of selling
                        sound and reliable goods at the smallest possible profit. The success of
                        this flotation should be a proof to our local financiers that sound
                        industrial undertakings in this country can be turned into companies with as
                        much case as in the case of land, building, and similar concerns.</p>

                    <p>A few days ago the Union Fonciere d'Egypte refused an offer of L.E. 101 per
                        feddan for the thousand feddans of its property in the Gharbieh province,
                        which it had originally purchased for L.E. 52 per feddan. The company was
                        well advised to refuse this offer as it is now selling this land in lots at
                        an average rate of L.E. 110 per feddan and there is great keennees amoung
                        the fellaheen to buy at this price.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the irHux of gold, which is in great part still in the villages, the
                        demand for agricultural land as an investment by the fellaheen is becoming
                        more marked every day and the Union Fociere is receiving offers at excellent
                        prices continually. For example, the other day it received an offer for its
                        land at Kafr Shargi, in the Gharbieh province, at the rate of L.E. 70 per
                        feddan for 700 feddans. The company purchased this land only a few months
                        ago for L.E. 45 per feddan. Other offers have been received at the rate of
                        L.E. 70 per feddan for land purchased from the Behera Company L.E. 40.</p>
                    <p>The Union Fonceire will close its first balance sheet on the 15th proxo.,
                        which will cover eighteen months' working as the company was founded in

                    <p>Hotels Filled to Overflowing.</p>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Luxor, February 8.</p>
                    <p>Upper Egypt is just now being invaded by an army of visitors from every part
                        of the civilised world, and Luxor is experiencing such an influx as has
                        never before been known. The hotels are filled to overflowing, and, judging
                        by the advance bookings for rooms and for berths on the steamers, the season
                        of 1907 looks like being a long one.</p>
                    <p>Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir Ernest Cassel passed through this week on their
                        way further South, while Lord Cromer is expected here shortly.</p>
                    <p>The dahabeah contingent is much to the fore just now, and the little flest
                        moored on both sides of the river adds greatly to the life and interest of
                        the scene. The Miriam, Bedouin, and Nephthis are still at their customary
                        moorings, but the Gazelle has left for the South, while the Arabia, Serapis,
                        and Scarab, have passed through once more on their homeward journey.</p>
                    <p>Amongst well-known people making a stay at the Winter Palace are Lord and
                        Lady Halsbury, the Baronne de Foret, Sir J. Hamilton Lang and family, the
                        Hon. Alexander Yorke, C.V.O., Sir Robert Dashwood, and many others.</p>
                    <p>The Tuesday dances at this hotel are proving very popular. Several of the
                        passengers from the tourist steamers responded to the invitation of the
                        manager last Tuesday, as well as visitors from the other hotels.</p>
                    <p>The Gymkhanas, on Thursdays, are also well patronised, and always fo with a
                        smoothness and rapidity that tell of long cooperation on the part of the
                        commitee. This week there were the usual races for natives, the donk y boys'
                        race (face to tail and bare back) being perhaps the most popular with the
                        spectators, while the visitors' events consisted of (1) a donkey race for
                        ladies and gentlemen, won by Miss Thompson, M. A. Found being a good second
                        and (2) a goolah begging race in which Mr. C. Warnes was first and Dr. J
                        Garner second.</p>
                    <p>After a week of cold winds and somewhat low temperature for this region, the
                        weather is once more warm and gentle, and Luxor is maintaining its high
                        recognation for sunshine and equability.</p>

                    <head>Miss Critten's Entertainment.</head>
                    <p>Miss Critten has but a small audience at the first of her "One-hour recitals"
                        at Shepheards on Friday night, but there was not one among that audience who
                        was not fully impressed by the dramatic talent she displayed. In addition to
                        her wonderful memory and pleasing voice Miss Critten possesses a fine sense
                        of humour and an instinct for effect which would have served her in good
                        stead had she only chosen the stage as her profession. Her recitations, or
                        impersonations, or whatever she likes to call them, are really delightful
                        little studies of character, and the play of feature and action in company
                        with her wonderfullly sympathetic voice are singularly attractice. As
                        raconteuse or teller of short stories, too, she is excellent, never losing
                        the point of her racy, pithy anecdotes, and recounting them with such
                        naivety and simplicity, that she holds the attention of her audience from
                        first to last.</p>
                    <p>Her programme on Friday night included a very varied assortment of items.
                        There were many short, crisp stories, and one or two very humorous dialogues
                        of greater length; and an exceedingly clever item in which she impersonated
                        a charming young aunt endeavouring to tell an edifying story to a child who
                        refused to be edified. The "piece-de-resistance" of the programme was
                        perhaps the item entitled "Harry," which gave Miss Critten real scope for
                        her dramatic instinct, and which certainly accounted for a very chokey
                        sensation in the throats of more than one of her bearers. Miss Blanche
                        Simpson provided a little music during the interval which Miss Critten found
                        neccessary to rest her voice; for the one-hour-recital did not finish for
                        some time after 10:30, and must have been a tiring performance.</p>
                    <p>Miss Critten is giving a second recital at the Savoy to-night at 9.30, when
                        it is anticipated that she will receive a very good hearing. She is so
                        exceptionally clever, that one can unhesitatingly recommend any one who is
                        in search of a new sensation to attend one of her performances. Hotel
                        visitors are so prone to complain of the dulness of their evening hours,
                        that short entertainments such as Miss Critten's should be particularly
                        acceptable.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Dicey's New Boook</p>
                    <p>A very interesting book on the political situation of this country has just
                        been published by Heinemann (price 3s. 6d) entitled "The Future of Egypt."
                        The author is M. Edward Dicey, whose forty odd years' connection with Egypt
                        renders him a peculiarly competent critic. The author's object is "to direct
                        attention to certain defects in British administration under our
                        protectorate, and to the policy by which these defects could best be
                        rectified." The author criticises Lord Cromer's system of government and the
                        suppression of the capitulations. His criticisms are characterised by a
                        boldness which is very rare among English writers in Egypt, but they are at
                        the same time quite free from the personal vindictiveness which prevents Mr.
                        Wilfrid Blunt from being taken seriously so far as matters Egpytian are
                        concerned. We will deal with Mr. Dicey's work in other issue, as there are a
                        great many passages which deserve reproduction. Meanwhile we will conclude
                        this brief, preliminary notice of a book, which we recommend all interested
                        in Egypt to obtain for themselves, by one excerpt, which will give our
                        readers some idea of the style of the work. The following are Mr Dicey's
                        opinions on Lord Cromer's scheme of reforms in connection with the
                        suppression of the capitulations as contained in his latest report:-</p>
                    <p>'To speak plain English, the way to understand the projeot in question is to
                        strike out the name of Egyptian Government whenever it appears, and to
                        substitute for it that of the British Agency. The capitulations, the Mixed
                        Tribunals, the Consuls-General accredited to the Khedive, and last but not
                        least the European companies and capitalists, are the only influlences left
                        in Egypt which interfere with the absolute autocracy Lord Cromer's policy
                        would confer, not only upon himself, but upon his successors in the post, he
                        now occupies as the representative of our unavowed Protectorate. I find it
                        difficult to comprehend how antonomy is compatible with absolute personal
                        autncracy. I learn from Lord Cromer's two last reports that the aim of his
                        policy is tp prepare Egypt for antonomy. I do not doubt for one moment the
                        sincerity of this avowal. My intelligence, however, is unlimited to enable
                        me to understand how the absolute autorsey of the ruler can be the way to
                        prepare the ruled for autonomy. The process seems to me analogons to that of
                        the schnolmeter who undertook to teach his pupils the art of swimming but
                        would never allow them to go into the water till they had learnt to
                        swim."</p>

                    <byline>(From Our Correspondent)</byline>
                    <dateline>London, January 27.</dateline>
                    <p>Lieutenant the Honorable CD. Baring, Coldstream Guards, has left the
                        army.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. J. M. O'Connor, Presbyterian chaplain, has been directed to proceed
                        to Egypt for duty there.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieutenant Loftus. 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, has
                        been promoted lieutenant after three years' service.</p>
                    <p>The three troopers of the Deopt Squadron 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons,
                        Ballincollig, whose Christmas midnight escapde has been already reported in
                        these notes, were tried by a district court martial last week, and found
                        guilty. The sentence will be duly promulgated and it is safe to say that the
                        three men will not hanker after gagging and tying up sentries and
                        commandeering horses for some time to come.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Haldane's new organisation scheme has been not ineptly likened to the
                        mountain in labour, and "Punch" has very happily hit off the situation by
                        representing the author in the guise of a motherly old hen clucking
                        triumphantly over her six chickens (divisions), whilst Mr. Brodrick in a
                        simliar guise, but without the chickens, reminds the former of the fate of
                        his six (army corps) chicks. The scheme is eminently a paper one. A striking
                        force of 150,000 is promised, of which only 70,000 will be regulars, and a
                        large proportion of which is not, nor never will be, available. The
                        remainder has to be made up by problematical Militia, Yeomanry, and
                        Volunteers. In the interim, the nucleus of the "striking force" will have to
                        find the usual Indian, Egyptian, and Colonial drafts, a process which will
                        result in the usual lemon squeezing of the battalions and batteries. As
                        heretofore India and the Colonies will demand the very pick of the army at
                        home, and nothing will be left for the striking force save the immature and
                        the unfit. Whilst the defence of India depends on the rise and fall of the
                        home labour market there can be no permanent solution to the difficulty. The
                        only redeeming point in the scheme is the promised attempt to make a better
                        use of the militiamen already serving in the old Constitutional Force. But
                        it is only an idea of expediency, and until it is properly tested by the
                        assay of experience no definite pronouncement can be made. To repeat it
                        again, India blocks the way.</p>

                    <p><persName>Lady Cadogan</persName>, whose death is announced in this morning's
                        telegrams, was the daughter of the second Earl of Craven, her other sisters
                        being the Countess of Wilton and the Countess of Coventry. She was born in
                        1844 and married in 1865 Earl Cadogan, by whom she had six sons and two
                        daughters.</p>
                    <p>We are sorry to learn that much anxiety is felt about the health of Lady
                        Suffield, who is lying seriously ill with a complication of influenza and
                        bronchitis. Lady Suffield, who is a sister of the first Lord Revelstoke and
                        of Lord Cromer, and aunt to Countess Granville, is a lady of advanced age,
                        for it is now several years sinoe she and Lord Suffield who is past
                        seventy-seven, celebrated their golden wedding day. They have long enjoyed
                        the intimate friendship of the Royal Family, and it is close on forty years
                        since Lord Suffield obtained his first Court appointment as Lord-in-Waiting
                        to Qaeen Victoria. He holds the same office in the Household of his present
                        Majesty, and in his case it is, by Royal favour, a permanent one, for he
                        does not resign it on a change of Government. He was, as a matter of fact,
                        taking his turn of waiting last week ; but, in spite of that fact, his name
                        is omitted from the list of the King's Household in several wellknown books
                        of reference.</p>
                    <p>In his younger days Lord Suffield was one of the finest riders and keenest
                        all-round sportsmen in the kingdom. He was Master of the Royal Buckhounds in
                        1886, and hunted the Norfolk Foxhounds and Staghoands for many years showing
                        capital sport. At one time he was superintendent of the Prince of Wales's
                        stables, and in the Royal expedition to India of 1875 (when he was chief of
                        the staff to His Royal Highness he organised the sporting part of the tour
                        with the greatest success. Lord and Lady Sufffield have had a large family,
                        and their life has been clouded with seven domestic trials ; but their
                        danghters, who include Countess Carrington, Lady Hingdon, and Lady Hastings,
                        murel happily as well as Ini' ia tiy, and they have a son and heir and a
                        grands (now in his tenth year) to carry on the family name and honour .</p>

                            <p>The "Frankfort Gazette" says that the new Reichstag is as pacific as
                                the old one. The great majority of German people are always pacific.
                                The words used by the Emperor in his speech, "You will overcome all
                                who oppose you," cannot refer to a warlike purposs with regard to
                                the foreign policy of the nation, because the passage was made use
                                of in speaking directly of the elections. Before the elections a
                                section of the foregin press hoped that a victory for the Socialits
                                and the Centrists would bring about internal difficulties and lessen
                                Germany's power abroad. The German Empire will not modify any of her
                                inclinations or her foreign policy. (Reuter) </p>

                            <p>The whole commission appointed to report on the speed trial was on
                                board when a terrible explosion occurred which was followed by a
                                sudden rush of flame from the furnace into the engine-room where 11
                                men were working. After the explosion the quartermaster Levey,
                                although wounded, entered the engine-room, closed the valves, and
                                opened the ventilators, thus probably averting a greater

                        <p>We are happy having some warm weather at last, as visitors who have come
                            here in search of sunshine and to escape the cold have been grumbling
                            with good cause. Let us hope the change will be lasting, and that Cairo
                            will not loss its character.</p>
                        <p>The racing on Saturday was decidely good. The attendance also, for the
                            small meeting, was much above the average. The races on the 20th and
                            22nd inst. will be a good deal better. Visitors should not miss this
                            opportunity of seeing some of the best horses in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The course was in excellent condition. We noticed that the jump that so
                            often unaccountably brings horses to grief has been moved further up the
                            hill, with apparently satisfactory results. Our handicapper may once
                            again be congratualted on the close finishes of the handicaps.

                            was very slow. Wazir ran well up throughout, and coming into the
                            straight first was never really challenged, winning by three lengths, a

                        <p>Chater was rather fancied for this race, but, running out at this new
                            jump, lost a lot of ground. Chams led the field throughout, and seemed
                            to take his jumps fairly well. Mr. Reid on the Bard made up a good deal
                            of ground last 1/4 of a mile, but he had let Chams get too far ahead and
                            failed to catch him.</p>

                            Nimrod appeared in front for a short way. Chere also was well up. It
                            seemed any horse's race. Sinounou was first into the straight and
                            managed to stave off all challenges. Chere was beaten by a head for

                        <p>Owing to the inspection of the Inniskilling Dragoon Guards by General
                            Baden Powell, Thursday's matches were postponed until Friday. The first
                            teams to line out were as follows:-</p>
                        <p>A. TEAM. G. TEAM.</p>
                        <p>Major Pitman 3. Mr. Capell 1.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bentinck (back). Nixon 2.</p>
                        <p>Capt. Sherlock 2. Capt. Bartlett 3.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MaciGllivray 1. Sterling (back).</p>
                        <p>G. Team had the best of the game throughout and eventually won by 3 goals
                            to one. For the winners, Capt. Bartlett played a very good game, but his
                            shooting at goal was very wide of the mark; Mr. Nixon scoring two out of
                            the three goals registered. For the losers, Major Pitman and Mr.
                            Bentinok did most of the work, Capt. Sherlock and Mr. MacGillivray being
                            incidedly off their game.</p>
                        <p>D. TEAM. F. TEAM.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Merriman 1. Mr. Fieury 1.</p>
                        <p>Jervis Smith 2. " Bowen 2.</p>
                        <p>Major Haig 3. " Tellemache 3.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Graham (back). Maj. Paterson (back)</p>
                        <p>This was a faster and more evenly contested game, F. team winning by 2
                            goals to 1 D team were the first to score, but F team soon qualized, and
                            in the third chukker F team were one up. D team made great efforts in
                            the 4th chukker to get on equal terms, but failed in the attempts. For
                            the winners, Major Paterson and Mr. Bowen were conspicuons. Mr.
                            Tollemache also did some very good work. For the losers, Mr. Graham
                            played a fine game at back, and Major Haig as usual gave a very good
                            display.</p>
                        <p>E. TEAM. H. TEAM.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Soames 1. Mr. Heller 1.</p>
                        <p>Capt. Holland 2. Gibbs 2.</p>
                        <p>Rome 3. "Jenkison 3.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Raid (back). Capt. Darrell (back).</p>
                        <p>H team ought to have won on paper, but it was hard to play against Capt.
                            Rome's attacks, combined with the strong defense of Mr. Reid, this
                            last-namaed player especially being in good form. It was a close match
                            up to the last minute. H team failed to do themselves justice. Mr.
                            Jenkinson, however, made a brilliant run the full length of the ground,
                            leaving the ball just over the goal, which Mr. Gibbs tipped through.</p>

                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes specified in the Memorandum of
                        Association, and in particular to undertake contracts for the construction
                        of public buildings, private houses and other works, and to exploit the
                        manufacture of materials for construction and to acquire and carry on any
                        business useful in this connection.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed also to purchase, improve, develop lease and otherwise deal
                        with suburban and town properties</p>
                    <p>A feature of the business of the Company will be the construction of
                        buildings and houses on credit, the owner being allowed to pay the cost of
                        construction by the instalments with interest over an agreed number of
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The present demand for houses in Alexandria, Cairo and other towns in Egypt
                        is beyond the capacity of existing constructors, and it is considered that
                        there is ample scops for remunerative business for the Company in this
                        connection.</p>

                        financing sound industrial or commercial undertakings, more particularly
                        those whose objects are useful to the general scheme of their
                        undertaking.</p>

                    <p>(Aujourd'hui a midi et demie.)</p>
                    <p>Le marche a ete presque nul comme affaires, et comme tendance, c'est la
                        baisse qui predomine. Iln'yaeu de transactions importantes qu'en Nuugovich
                        Hotels et Karam; mais l'animation a regne egalement sur un certain nombre de
                        petites valeurs.</p>
                    <p>Sur la nouvelle, que nous reproduisons plus loin, de la vente de Savoy Hotel
                        par les Nungovich aux Estates, ces deux titres beneficient d'use avance
                        marquee. Les Nungovich touchent 28 1/4 et les Estates 2 21/32 acheteurs les
                        actions et 25 1/2 les parts de foundateur.</p>
                    <p>La Karam s'inscrit a 1 5/32 l'action et 9 la fondateur, l'Arditi a 1 3/8
                        l'action et 23 ia fondateur, la Langhis a 1 9/32, l'United a 1 1/4 l'action
                        et 9 3/4 la fondateur, lea Riz q 1 1/8.</p>
                    <p>Ces derniers ont donne lieu a un certain mouvement. Quant aux Splendid
                        Hotels, ilsont demandes a 4 9/16 maia sans affaires. Les pourparlers entre
                        les Ritz et les Splendid continuent et lon'est de plus en plus persuade
                        qu'ils aboutiront, au grand avantage des deux parties.</p>
                    <p>Eu hausse egalement les Cotton Mills a 6/6, la Salt and Soda a 23/9, l'action
                        Comptoir a 7 9/16 l'ancienne et 7 5/16 la nouvelle, et le Credit
                        Franco-Egyptien a 6 11/32; oes deux dernieres valeurs ont ete l'objet d'une
                        demande suivie.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, nombre d'autres sont en reaction: l'Agricole tombe a 9 27/32, la
                        National Bank a 28 5/16, les Priviegiess Tramways a 197, la Daira a 17 1/2,
                        l'Obligation Credit Foncier a 346, l'Union Fonciere a 6 11/32, la Land Bank
                        a 9, l'Urbaine a 7 3/8, la fondateur Comptoir a 90, les Constructions a 1
                        1/2 et l'Auto-Transport a 4 1/4.</p>
                    <p>L'ensemble du marche est plutot indecis. Il y a un certain malaise cause par
                        les nouveilles emissions.</p>
                    <p>Demain, a l'occasion du mardi-gras, le marche sera ferme.</p>
                    <p>L'Union Fonciere a refuse, ilyaque'ques jours, une offre de L.E. 101 par
                        feddau pour un lot de mille feddans de sa propriese de Gharbieh, qu'elle
                        avait achetes a raison de L.E 52 le feddan. Elle a ete bien inspires en
                        refusactceite offre, car les fallahs se disputent maintinant les lots a L.E
                        l1O le faddan. G. ace a l'afflux croissant de l'or dans les villages, les
                        placements en terrains sont en effet de plus en plus recherches et l'Union
                        Fonciere recoit continuellement des affres de jour en jour plus allechantes.
                        On lui a propose, entre autres, d'acheter 700 feddans de sa propriere de
                        Kafr Chargui (Gharbieh) a raison de 70 L.E. le feddan, propriete qu'elle a
                        eue, il n'y a que quelques mois, pour 45 L.E. le feddan. Pour d'antres
                        terrains quelle a obtenus de la Behera au prix de 40 L.E. on lui offre
                        maintenant 70 LE. par feddan.</p>

                        tient a 4 3/4, en attendant une neuvelle reduction, car on prevoit que la
                        Banque d'Angleterre ne tardera pas a abaisser son taux a 4 1/2, voire a 4%.

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that jmne of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer then the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to an leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co's steamers,
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            mochto interest the visitor The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored
                            under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna,
                            and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                            remains that are found all over the island, are an endless source of
                            pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                            which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                            in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The
                            cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000
                            inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a deligthful
                            climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city The Palazzo
                            Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia
                            degli Erimiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                            Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino
                            Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours All who can will
                            devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                            portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too
                            well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings yon to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is |
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            deligltful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are Unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                            possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                            sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba). — The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature— warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes and paintings, are
                            a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in
                            Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble calumns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santa filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern ltaly before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours' journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other seaport. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            and is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso,
                            situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting
                            paintings, "Entombment," by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by

                    <head>To The Printers of Egypt.</head>
                    <p>TEN years ago we established in London the CAXTON TYPE FOUNDRY to manufacture
                        Printing Types on the interchangeable time and labor-saving principles of
                        Standard Point Line, and Point Set on Point Body. We claimed, and have
                        establisked the statement, that the exclusive use of Caxton Printing Types
                        would save one-fourth of the compositors time in the setting of all kinds of
                        hand composition. At the present time over 10,000 Printers in tke United
                        Kingdom, Australasia, Canada, Africa, tke Indian Empire and other British
                        possessions are customers of tke Caxton Type Foundry.</p>
                    <p>As is well known, the type industry of America is controlled by a type TRUST,
                        and in the United Kingdom by a similar organization known as the type RING
                        of British Type Manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>The CAXTON TYPE FOUNDRY was founded to oppose all suck combinations. It is
                        independent of all such connections, and is therefore, selling type at a
                        lower price, and furthermore, guarantees to sell at the same price in all
                        parts of the British Empire.</p>
                    <p>Another branch is the CAXTON WOOD MILLS, the largest and most complete Wood
                        Working Plant in the British Empire exclusively employed in the production
                        of space and labour - saving woodwork for Printers. We kave made a
                        speciality of using hard wood exclusively in all our productions. Wood
                        Furniture and Reglet is made out of Tungstone. a specially close-grained
                        Wood which is so heavy that it sinks in water and is therefore particularly
                        valuable.</p>
                    <p>We are also makers of the widest and the most complete range of PLATEN
                        PRESSES in the World, comprising the well-known ''Caxton" Platen, for fine
                        work: the light-running "Swift" Platen for small printers: the Haddon
                        "Improved Gordon," suitable for any jobbing printer: the Haddon "Safety
                        Platen," capable of printing 2,500 full forms per hour: the Haddon "Improved
                        Victoria," modelled on the Croppar principle, but superior in construction
                        and output.</p>
                    <p>We invite enquiries, when complete Catalogies with all details will be sent
                        post free.</p>
