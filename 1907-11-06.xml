                        whether it will be necessary for the Bank of England to raise the rate of
                        discount at to-morrow's meeting, the probability of which has been suggested
                        by earlier telegrams. </p>

                    <p>The Survey Department has issued the following report on the weather during
                        October </p>
                    <p>last: </p>
                    <p>Throughout the month, the weather has been usually fine and undisturbed in
                        character. </p>
                    <p>Lightning occurred at Cairo and Port Said on the evening of the 21st. At
                        Cairo, this was immediately followed by a short but violent hailstorm in
                        which there fell hailstones up to 25 m.m. in diameter At Port Said on the
                        following afternoon, there was a similar more violent storm, also preceded
                        by lightning. In this case, the hailstones were even larger than at Cairo,
                        the largest piece picked up being of the weight of 560 grammes. </p>
                    <p>Pressure was above normal over the Eastern Mediterranean, but somewhat below
                        at all stations south of Cairo. </p>
                    <p>Temperature was higher than normal in the Central Mediterranean, lower over
                        Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean, higher over the Sudan north of
                        Khartoum, and lower again south of Khartoum. </p>
                    <p>Rainfall was in excess in the south at Kodok and Gallabat usual in the month
                        appears to have failed entirely. </p>
                    <p>River gauges fell steadily throughout the month except for the two small
                        waves which checked the fall of the Blue Nile. Roseires is now 25 cms. below
                        the average of seven years and Wadi Halfa a metre below the average of
                        sixteen years. </p>
                    <p>The volume of the flood has been about 35% below the volume of a sormal
                        flood. </p>

                    <p>To-morrow being the 1st of Showwal is the commencement of the Ramadan Bairam
                        or Id es Sugheiyer. This festival is held on the first three days of
                        Showwal, and celebrates the close of Ramadan, whence it is also called Id
                        el-Fitr ('Festival of Breaking the Fast'). This, though called the minor, is
                        in reality the greater of the two great Muslim 'ids as regards ontward signs
                        of rejoicing. Prayers are performed in the mosques. New clothes are worn.
                        Visits are made, especially by women, to the tombs upon which palm branches,
                        etc., are laid. Particular dishes are prepared. Amusements of various sorts
                        are provided, and the streets present an animated appearance. The district
                        outside the Bab en-Nasr is one of the chief scenes of gaiety. In the
                        cemetery beyond, and near the 'Tombs of the Khalifs,' tents are pitched, and
                        the buildings there situate are occupied by visitors, many of whom
                        distribute cakes, dates, etc, to the poor. The Khedive holds an early
                        reception, which all officials and many others attend. The princesses also
                        receive visits of numerous ladies. Visits are exchanged by friends and
                        relations amongst all classes. The ordinary salutation between friends, who
                        kiss each other on both cheeks, is "Kul am wa int bikheyr" (May you be
                        prosperous every year), or "Kul saneh int tayib," equivalent to our "Many
                        happy returns of the day." </p>

                        <p>To The EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." </p>
                        <p>Sir,- It is an extraordinary fact that notwithstanding the number of
                            English residents in Cairo, there is not a school in the town to which
                            Englismen can send their children and at the same time be sure that the
                            education they receive will be the same as it would be in England, in
                            fact there is not a single English school in the town, and such parents
                            as are unable to afford the expense of keeping their children at
                            boarding school at home, are obliged to send them to schools in Cairo,
                            which, however, excellent they may be, are still conducted on foreign
                            lines and principles. The foundation of an English school for the
                            exclusive use of the English is of course quite outside the province of
                            the Government, it is only necessary for the people who are interested
                            in the subject to prove that the demand exists, and the foundation of
                            such a school would follow as a matter of course, but as long as these
                            people appear to be content with the existing system, so will it
                            continue, the persons in whose power the forming of the desired school
                            would lie being naturally backward in the carrying through of a project
                            which has not been asked for and the success of which is to all
                            appearances doubtful. It must be borne in mind that the governing bodies
                            of our large schools at home are for the most part in ignorance of the
                            needs of this country, indeed we do not doubt that there are a great
                            number of Englishmen in Cairo, residents, who have not the slightest
                            idea of the number of married people of their own nationality, who have
                            families growing up, and would welcome an educational establishment here
                            in order to avoid the necessity of keeping their children at home, or of
                            sending them for instruction to schools of an alien nationality. There
                            are of course schools in Cairo, where English masters are kept for the
                            teaching of English, but this is not all that is required, the children
                            are forced to mix with others who are not of their country, and the
                            essential features of our methods of educational training are thereby
                            lost to them. It is doubtless an advantage for ones children to grow up
                            with the knowledge of divers tongues, and the insight into the varied
                            characters of the different nationalities with which they are brought
                            into contact is often of undeniable use to them in after life, but in a
                            town such as Cairo it is not necessary for such experience to be picked
                            up at the schools, the every day existence of residents offers
                            sufficient opportunities for the assimilation of such language and
                            ideas, and I consider that in the majority of cases more harm than good
                            is effected by the indiscriminate mixing of nationalities which of
                            necessity occurs under the present regime obtaining in Cairo. It would
                            be to the advantage of any one to start a good school here, make it
                            thoroughly English, and run as nearly as possible on the same lines as
                            at home, and a great and pressing need would be satisfied. It must be
                            distinctly understood that I do not wish to attempt to minimize in the
                            least degree the excellence of the moral and mental training common in
                            the existing schools of Cairo, many of our countrymen have profited
                            materially by them and I wish them all the success which they so
                            undoubtedly deserve, I desire only to call the attention of English
                            parrents to the fact that the formation of English schools for the
                            teaching of their offspring, lies, to a very great extent in their own
                            hands. </p>

                    <head>A MOSQUITO CAMPAIGN. </head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR PORT SAID CORRESPONDENT) </byline>
                    <p>Professor Ronald Ross, the director of the Liverpool School of Tropical
                        Medicine, has jast passed through Port Said on his way to Mauritius. He is
                        going there by the invitation of the Colonial Office to institute a campaign
                        against mosquitoes and malaria in that island. On his arrival in Port Said
                        he visited the Governor and the Canal Authorities and made an examination of
                        the campaign in progress here. He expressed his approval of the measures
                        taken and the results obtained-almost a complete extermination of the past
                        throughout the whole of the European and Native quarters. </p>
                    <p>The work bas presented some considerable difficulties which have now been
                        overcome thanks to the energy of the Governor and Dr. Ross our Sanitary
                        Inspector. There was no opposition on the part of the inhabitants as was at
                        first anticipated by some. There has been a great reduction of all fevers in
                        our town this year, and Port Said, which before was insanitary, is now a
                        healthy summer resort. Considering that 18 months ago when the campaign was
                        first started, mosquito curtains were used in offices during the day and
                        that now they are not needed for the beds at night, is sufficient proof of
                        the success of the campaign at Port Said under the supervision of our able
                        inspector. </p>

                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard" writes as follows concerning a rumour, probably quite
                        baseless:- </p>
                    <p>A rumour is current in political circles - even in the local press. It is
                        more than a rumour, more than a report, and we, for reasons that need not be
                        defined at any length in these columns, are in a position to state that
                        these rumours and reports are almost facts, or, to say the least, are
                        founded on facts. </p>
                    <p>Consequently we do not exaggerate when we state that it is not only possible
                        but probable that the autocratic despotism of the provincial inspectors is
                        going to cease; that in future they will limit the sphere of their activity
                        and authority to the task of inspecting and not ordering the police force in
                        the provinces, and that, on the other hand, the mudirs will recuperate,
                        after having been monopolised for years in the hands of British inspectors,
                        in many cases unfit for the task imposed upon them, their legitimate and
                        legal right to provide for public security and safety in the rural districts
                        of the Valley of the Nile. </p>
                    <p>The reform is important. It is one we have incessantly advocated in the
                        interests of the dwellers in the provinces. Consequently we are the first to
                        applaud this new decision taken by the Occupation authorities and which is
                        perhaps due to the new Agent's initiative in the matter. </p>
                    <p>We have likewise pointed out that the police organisation in the provinces,
                        wrested from the hands of mudirs trained to their work and carefully chosen
                        by the central government, and placed "apparently" in those of manikins, in
                        some cases uneducated, and "in reality" in those of so-called inspectors
                        whose duty it was to spend many months at head-quarters, many months in
                        England and a few months in a soi-disant turn of inspection -- had wrought
                        far greater harm than good to the country and its inhabitants. </p>
                    <p>We even compared Mehemet Ali's times - as far as public safety is concerned -
                        with those of the Occupation, and the deductions drawn from these
                        comparisons favoured the former and not the latter period in Egypt's
                        history. </p>
                    <p>We insisted upon the reforms which would have to be introduced in the
                        provincial police organisation, namely, the recuperation by the mudirs of
                        their authority; the limitation of the inspectors' duties to the task of
                        inspecting, and of thoroughly inspecting without giving precise orders or
                        moving the police force about at their own sweet will. And thirdly we
                        insisted upon the education of mudirs and omdehs and police officers-upon
                        the practical education which would give them the necessary insight into and
                        knowledge of social organisations, to enable them to discharge their duties
                        as their more experienced forefathers had done before the days of the
                        Occupation and the epoch of denationalisation. </p>
                    <p>We now learn that the first two parts of our demands have been listened to,
                        namely that the inspectors' rule is to be limited to inspection, and that
                        the mudirs and omdehs are to be given a freer hand in the discharge of their
                        duties. Remains the third part of our demand, which we sincerely hope will
                        be taken into immediate consideration and be deserving of a special mention
                        among the proposed educational reforms. </p>
                    <p>That inspectors should inspect, is a truth which Webster's
                        Dictionary--without going any further-will confirm. Thus it is but natural,
                        logical and rational that they should do so. We are glad to see that such in
                        going to be the case and heartily approve of this first step in the
                        direction of "Egypt for the Egyptians." May it not be the last, because the
                        only way for the British to obtain the good-will and esteem of the
                        Egyptians, is by introducing the reforms we propose in our columns, and by
                        returning to Egyptians their usurped right of looking after, organizing and
                        furthering their own interests. </p>
                    <p>But it Webster's Dictionary confirms our - and everybody's - belief that
                        inspectors are those who inspect, it likewise approves us when we assert
                        that advisers are those who advise. We do not know - we do not even pretend
                        to know - what the new Agent's instructions to the advisers are. But we do
                        know and have no hesitation in repeating that the only task these gentlemen
                        are supposed to perform is that of advising in the ministries to which they
                        are attached. </p>
                    <p>Therefore, whilst awaiting the propitious moment - when these posts will be
                        entirely abolished because superfluous - it seems to us logical enough that
                        the gentlemen who fill them should limit their pent-up energies to the wise
                        performance of their duties without overstepping the bounds our friend
                        Webster has clearly defined. </p>
                    <p>In view of which - and we repeat it - we hope that the same restrictions will
                        immediately be placed upon the sphere of the Advisers' influence, as have
                        been - or are about to be - put on that of the provincial inspectors. </p>

                    <p>AN INDIAN'S APPRECIATION.</p>
                    <p>The following letter has been received by Sir Eldon Gorst from a certain
                        Naraindas Tiloomall, of Indian nationality: - </p>
                    <p>"May it please your Excellency, I the undersigned, beg to state as follows.
                        It is a remarkable phenomenon that India was in a forlorn state some
                        centuries ago. Its inhabitants were quite illiterate. They used to wear
                        clothing made of a very coarse quality of stuff resembling Hessian cloth.
                        There was no dream of the railroads no trains, no post offices, people were
                        travelling to and fro in carts driven by bullocks and a journey of short
                        distance was taking months to complete. No individual dared neither to leave
                        his country nor had any ideas of a voyage beyond the seas. The most
                        important thing to mention it is that it was governed by such people who had
                        no fixed rules of their own and every human being both male and female was
                        in a great terror, in fact the whole country was in a great alarm. But when
                        the British Government occupied the country, a sunlight of their good deeds
                        was thrown upon India and the Indians. Education was widely spread, schools
                        and colleges were opened for the public, hospitals were opened for the use
                        of indigent unhealthy persons, clothing of varieties were imported into the
                        country. Railroads were constructed, post offices opened, telegraph wires
                        were connected and many other things were amended which are quite
                        innumerable to mention. The journey which was to be completed in days prior
                        the paramount British reign can now be finished in hours. Every man both
                        rich and poor has an absolute liberty and permanent prosperity, as English
                        people are the founders of civilisation and reforms, and the British
                        Government has gratified and has been endeavouring to keep up the wishes of
                        the loyal India and the Indians and every precautionary measures have been
                        taken to protect and safe guard the country from those who desire it to
                        suffer. Looking to the question from a broad standpoint, India has been
                        raised to a highest pitch since the British rule and it is quite apparent
                        that the foundation of British rule in India is peaceful, creating free
                        liberty and mercy.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE SIR AUGUSTUS HEMMING </head>
                    <p>SHIP STEWARD'S ALLEGED FRAUD. </p>
                    <p>Jules Hamel, thirty-six, alias George McGie, a steward, was charged on a
                        warrant before Mr. Paul Taylor, at Marylebone with obtaining £1 2s.6d. by
                        means of false and fraudulent pretences, from Mrs. Mabel G.G. Fausett, the
                        daughter of Sir Augustus Hemming, residing at 57, Cleveland-square, W. </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Fausett said her father, Sir Augustus Hemming, died on March 27 last at
                        Cairo. Six days later a letter was left at her house addressed to her
                        father, and on the following day the prisoner called there. He said he was
                        the writer of the letter, and went on to explain that be was steward on the
                        S.S. "Hurona," which had just come from Egypt, and had called there
                        expecting to see her father. She replied that he had died a few days before.
                        He expressed surprise, and then stated that the British Consul at Port Said
                        had given him two cases and deputed him to bring them to London and despatch
                        them to Sir Augustus Hemming. This, he said, he had done. He then turned to
                        go, but on reaching the front door he stopped to explain that the charges on
                        the box had been fully paid, and handed her what purported to be a receipt
                        for £1 2s.6d. signed by the purser of the S.S. "Hurona." Believing his
                        story, she said she supposed she ought to repay him the money. "Yes, you
                        ought," he said, "because I have paid all the charges," and she thereupon
                        handed him the money, and he signed the receipt on the back and left. Her
                        husband afterwards made inquiries, and discovered that no such a ship as the
                        "Hurona" had some from Port Said. </p>
                    <p>Detective Parsons said he found the prisoner detained the previous day at
                        Brixton, and in reply to the charge he remarked. "All right." Upon him were
                        found eight receipt forms filled in similarly to the one given to Mrs.
                        Fausett, eighteen blank forms, two letters like the one sent to Sir Augustus
                        Hemming, a fountain pen, and some blotting-paper. The officer added that the
                        prisoner was well known to the police. </p>

                        careful to leave their names and particulars of their addresses, because
                        they experience very great difficulty in finding out where people live. This
                        would be the case with newcomers in any town, but it is much more so in a
                        great city like Cairo, where the names of streets and localities are so hard

                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes - The state of the Cairo streets has for so long
                        a time been the cause of complaint, their filth and roughness have so
                        frequently been commented opon without avail, that we had almost come to
                        look upon the existing state of things as a inevitable disgrace which we
                        were powerless to remedy, and to cease to marmur when we are forced to leave
                        a pavement strewn with the stone and rubbish which is being carted to 'or
                        from some new building, but bitherto we have had no reason to speak of
                        either roada or pavements as being absolutely dangerous. </p>
                    <p>We cannot, however, say the same thing any longer, for the department which
                        has previously only been guilty of an astonishing laxity, bas now gone to
                        the extreme of allowing the exes vations for new buildings to eneroach upon
                        the public pavement, and to leave it to chance that the passer-by may notice
                        it before he is precipitated into an excavation at least a couple of feet
                        deep </p>
                    <p>A few days ago there was a pavement in the Sharia Madebegh, of which last
                        night a portion had been removed and the excavation above mentioned had
                        taken its place. There was no light to mark the spot and absolutely no
                        barrier of any kind erected to prevent the possibility of an accident </p>
                    <p>There is no excuse for such gross carelessness on the part of the authorities
                        who are responsible to us for at least safety in the streets. In no other
                        town would such a thing be allowed, and one can see no reason why it should
                        be tolerated here. The constant block ing of the pavements with building
                        material is perhaps unavoidable, though even in this case a little
                        supervision of the contractors would do much to redace the evil, but to
                        leave a gaping excavation in one of our most frequented streets is an
                        anpardonable breach of duty. </p>

                    <p>It would no doubt be interesting for the publie to know that stenm plongbing
                        was in troduced in Mersina distriot as far back As twenty years ago. Abdeon
                        Pasha, one of the goveryons general of Aden, was the first to bay and steam
                        plough of the somewhat primitive type then in existence, about two decades
                        ago, for a large farm of his in Soletkin. But the Oriental, far more the
                        Turk, is apt, no matter bow progressive his spirit, to allow some what
                        compliented machinery requiring carefal handling and vigilant maintenance,
                        Bosnovamb to the rust of innate negligence and hereditary indolence. But
                        there seems to be a general Awakening, and, at least this part of the bear
                        Bast, is catching the emulative spirit, and girding up its loins. The steam
                        ploughin question was taken up some time ago by successor to the estate of
                        Abdeen Posbe certain Abdel Kader Blondi and put by him to a more or less
                        pratical asa. This paved the way for the introduction of up to date steam
                        ploughs, and the John Fowler atean plough works in Leeds, that have a
                        leading position in this industry, took naturally the first footing, and
                        through the perfection of their machines are likely to hold an undisputed
                        ground. Whar Agricultural possibilities the vulgarizing of these machines
                        will open up in this virgin country can hardly he ganged, especially in
                        connection with the cotton culture. Six Fowler steam ploughs are already in
                        practical use by wealthy landowners in Mersins district. Two 16 hp.
                        steam-driven ploughs, worth about £4000 each, are oweed and worked | by
                        Chaker Effendi Boutros and wealthy Syrian </p>
                    <p>landowner and tour 20 h. p. ploughs of £5000 worth each, have quite as
                        recently been | bought by Chaker Pasha, a very wealthy Ansairi landowner. </p>
                    <p>Despite the cost and difficulty of discharge And transport of such beavy
                        lifts in a port like Mersins, the advantages of these perfected machines
                        have become so patent to the in telligent class of wealthy landowners that
                        fartber large orders have recently been made, And as many as 300 tons will
                        shortly be on the way from England by Prince liners. Once landed these
                        machines insy by their own motive force be made to roll them selves to
                        ultimate destination inland. No roads are required and fields may be crossed
                        provided they are more or less level. To avoid wear and tear to the motor,
                        and reduce the difficulty of ponderous manipulation to its minimum, steel
                        cables of rope wire are used, and while the motor is fixel in a sheltered
                        place in the farm-bouse, the motive power in transmitted by means of the
                        cables to the plough, that is set working at a distance in the fields. The
                        Powler machines used actually in Mersine district can plough from eighty to
                        125 donums per day and they torn up the soil st'a depth varying between 25
                        and 30 centimeters. Six thousand donums (three don ums making about an acre)
                        of cotton land are now under cultivation by the steamplough. The results
                        obtained seem to have been startling. The same land ploughed by these
                        maehines bas given a treble and quadro ple yield compared with an adjoining
                        property of identie soil and position, worked by the ordinary plough. But
                        the great value of these steamploughs does not reside merely in the fact of
                        their turning up virgin soil for exploitation and allowingexhaust ed one to
                        rest and acquire fresh fortilizing power, but also in the fret that by
                        breaking it up to such a depth it allows whatever quantity of rain falls, to
                        sink slowly and infiltmte into the lower strata, and thus keep the land
                        fresh and humid, instead of the water running over it and losing itself in
                        lowlands, converted into marshes, or into the sen, as has hitherto been the
                        case with land ander ordinary primitive cultivation, which leaves the soil
                        hardened and, to a certain extent, impervious to the beneficial aetion of
                        rain. This quality for a country like Syria, where rain is so precious and
                        som certain is inestimable. A more or less uniform yield may thus be insured
                        Another great advantage of these steamploughs is their rapid work. The
                        ploughing season, as is well known, is limited, and for a vast property
                        where a very considerable supply of hands and cattle is required the
                        importance of this point acquires further value. With the problem of labour
                        that wholesale emigration bas lately raised in Syria labour-saving machinery
                        in general in getting to be indispensable. </p>
                    <p>Thus Mersinais destined to enter into the ranks of cotton producing
                        countries, and to be the pioneer among Turkish provinces in the adoption of
                        scientific methods of agriculture. of particular significance is this
                        impending revolution in the history of Agriculture in Turkey, because, with
                        the state of insecurity that there reigns, the growing of cereals and
                        edibles in general is being gradually neglected especially in places far
                        from Government centres, and the growing of cotton becomes a most
                        recommendable, and, indeed, the only agricultural resource of a more or less
                        safe exploitation. When one thinks of the vast and fertile landa in Syria
                        that actually lie in waste and could, so to speak, be got for a song, And of
                        their posible transformation into cotton fields under the magie-influence of
                        the perfected stein-driven plough, without the fear of robbery or damage (or
                        at least these dangers greatly minimized) it would be surprising if foreign
                        capital should any more hesitate to come into this land. In the vast plains
                        of Hama and Homs there are magaificent pro perties, irrigable and otherwise

                        long usage and tradition. If cotton were to be subtitated and grown
                        according to up-to-date methods as described above, the risks of theft and
                        aggression would, to my mind, be sensibly minimized, and indeed set off by
                        the chances of rich and remunerative crops. The undisputed domination of the
                        cotton market by Ameries and the dangers of an abusive single control
                        constitute a problem that ons het seriously engaging the attention of

                    <p>On strolling through the town of LAMA one cannot but be strook with the
                        enormous improvements that bave been made in its appearamos and the look of
                        prosperity it now enjoys. On every band one notices new and beautiful
                        buildings taking the place of its older and smaller houses and its waste
                        spaces Among these are the new offices for the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which
                        will, when finished, add greatly to the beauty of the Konak Square, a site
                        in itself to gain the envy of many a larger town. One asks oneself why this
                        energy and life in this sleepy and said to be dying old town 1 On yuzing out
                        upon the wide expanse of its glorious buy the answer is easy to see, for
                        lying off the port are no less than eight steamers busy loading and
                        unloading, ench constantly calling in varions musical tones for the lighters
                        to burry and wante no valenble time. Around the steamers are at least one
                        hundred siling craft of various sizes and shapes, each adding its quota to
                        the trade of the port </p>
                    <p>On the beach, in the streets, are huge stacks of corn waiting to be shipped,
                        the overflow of the crowded stores, in the square are rows of cattle and
                        flocks of sheep going to help feed the people of Egypt, while near by are
                        hondreds of baskets of fruit, destined to find the RAINO market. Amongst all
                        the bustle one notices carts and truoks loaded with hundreds of soka gypsum
                        and with which all three piers may be seen laden. Passing along the marina
                        one is compelled to notice the fact that LAMAR is very far from being a
                        dying town. </p>
                    <p>Strolling through the town itself one notices many factorier, each busy
                        adding to the prosperity of Larson. That of Mr Amiet! situated in the heart
                        of the town is interesting with its combined gypsum, flour and cotton
                        ginning mills. Passing on and over the main road one notices the tall
                        chimney of Mr. Soundia's factory where gypsum and the burning of terra umbra
                        is the order of the day, following the line of mails one at length comes to
                        the new factory of the C.B.D. cement company, whose square buildings and
                        straight even roofs are in themselves an object lesson. Here is hurry and
                        bustle amongst its 60 to 80 men and women, vying with each other in trying
                        to satisfy the needs of its greedy kilns, which night and day give out their
                        cooked stone all pure white ready to be ground into plaster, such as one
                        sees only in Barope. On enquiry one learns that the factory is only yet in
                        its infancy, its powerful engine, probably the most powerful in the island
                        was destined to do great er work than the 50 tons per day it now can grind.
                        Now and larger kins are to be added until the output of this factory resebe
                        the maximam for which it was designed, namely, 20 tons of finished plaster
                        per hour. On leaving by the Famagusta Rond obe notious new houses and stores
                        in every direction with near by huge mountains of the terra ambra all rendy

                        LATDAN may well be proud of her progress and enterprise, and may the day be
                        far distant when she loses her place as the busiest centre of trade in the

                    <p>EGYPTIAN MANUSCRIPTS AT OXFORD.</p>
                    <p>Volume 2 of the "Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts in the Boldleian Library has
                        just been issued under the joint editorship of the late Dr. Adolf Neubauer,
                        and Mr. Arthur Ernest Cowley, MA, but in reality the major portion of the
                        work is due to the latter scholar, for as long ago as in 1894 the health of
                        Dr. Neubauer gave way and necessitated Mr. Cowley continuing the work. </p>
                    <p>This volume enumerates the additions of Hebrew Manuscripts acquired since
                        1886, that is to say it gives a list of all manuscripts con taining any
                        Hebrew text, because very many of the Codices mentioned are really Arabia
                        manuscripts with Hebrew interpolations and colophons. This second instalment
                        of the Bodleian Hebrew catalogue may most appositely be entitled The
                        Egyptian Manuscript volume for it contains the short descriptive notes
                        referring to the numerous fragmentary texts from the Geniza manuscript
                        monument room or the Jewish Synagogue at Old Cairo which commenced to pour
                        into the Oxford collection in the year 1890. Thus out of the 316 volumes
                        described in the new volume of the entalogue no less than 166 containing
                        about 2,673 frag: ments are believed to be from the Geniza </p>
                    <p>Mr. Cowley says that the contents of the Cairo Geniza were first brought to
                        notice by the Reverend Greville. J. Chester: but we believe that some year
                        of 80 previous Count d'Hulst sent' care containing specimens of the
                        manuscripts from it to the British Museum when the authorities neglected to
                        even examine its contents, and that by the time that Mr. Chester came across
                        some of the manuscripts the majority of the great store had been des troyed
                        and all more or less mutilated. </p>
                    <p>For readers of the "Egyptian Gazetto" the most interesting manoscripts
                        catalogued will be those from the Geniza and it will therefore be to them we
                        shall mainly refer. Being preserved in a Hebrew Synagogue the maJority of
                        the texts are necessarily portions of the "Old Testament". Many of them
                        being Arabio translations with Hebrew notes, or short passages. Closely
                        connected with this class of text are the Midrash commentaries and Talmudio
                        treatises, Liturgies and such like. The bulk of the pieces from the Geniza,
                        like the older Greco-Roman Bgyptian papyri, are legal documents or personal
                        communien: tions. In the case of the former the Bodleian Catalogue gives the
                        names of the parties, and those of the withesses, and officials and
                        magistrates mentioned when legible. For the letters, a brief sommary of the
                        contents is given Much interesting society and family history may be
                        obtained from those fragments, but they require comparing with the larger
                        series of Gepiza documents now preserved at Cambridge where are probably
                        other parts of the same persons, correspondence. Nearly all the older legal
                        memoranda with are mostly of the 11th and 12th centuries, are dated from Pos
                        tat. A few are earlier, such as the marriage 1 contract in volume 2805 which
                        relates to al certain Aaron bar Jeshuah. It is dated 5th of the month Elul
                        A.M. 4750-990. AD The same date is assigned to another record wherein the
                        son of a Jew ai Nisibis, in Asia Minor, is concerned. This bondle of old
                        Fostat texts contains four other marriage contracts. </p>
                    <p>One of these dated 1030 A.D. is interesting because of the numerous biblical
                        names it bears as Japheth, Soloman, Berakha, Shemariah, Abraham, Samuel,
                        Phinehas, Ephraim and Joseph As a specimen the most important texts bound up
                        in volume 2859 may be enumeratel. There is an astrological fragment. A deed
                        of gift dated A.D. 110. A contract of the same age and part of another deed.
                        These in Syrian coursive characters. Then come Some homilies, and fragments
                        of a commentary on Jeremiah in Arabie with Hebrew notes. A </p>
                    <p>huilar work on Hakaloth and another on Nambers 21, and part of Deuteronomy.
                        Then por tions of a Hebrew commentary upon Hosen Other pieces of Studies on
                        the Old Testamento follow. Then come poetical fragments and extracts from
                        Alfasi's treatise an the Babylonian Talmud. </p>
                    <p>As with Greek and Latin paypri the writings on the recto and verso of a
                        manuscript often differ materially. For instance on the back of and page
                        giving Leviticus 2. 6.17. as a naptial contract of Mubarakat daughter of
                        Soloman Kahna, drawn up at Postat in 1368 of the Seljuk era viz A.D. 1067.
                        Many of these writingi are in Spanish Rebbinical characters and also many
                        legal doouments refer to cities in North Africa and some to Toledo and
                        Spanish towns. One manuscript preserves the end of a Hebrew work upon the
                        plantes. The remains of medical books recoyered from the Geviza treasure are
                        perhaps of some value. For instance there is unfortunately incomplete,
                        Hassin-b-Isbag's introduction to Galen's Techne and fragments of a medical
                        dictionary in Hebrew, Arabie and Spanish. Some of the Antsie papyri Ind

                    <p>La température dans la première moitié d'Octobre n'a pas été favorable aux
                        cotonniers, les nuits ayant été souvent trop fratches. </p>
                    <p>Cette circonstance a naturellement, et un peu partout, retardé l'éclosion des
                        noix de la seconde oueillette ; même, dans certains dis. tricts, quelques
                        dégâts ont été constatés de ce chef. </p>
                    <p>En somme, la seconde cueillette, qui n'est pas encore terminée, ne répond
                        plus aux pers pectives qu'elle laisait entrevoir. </p>
                    <p>la troisième oueillette se présente irré. gulière, suivant les localités ;
                        ses résultats definitifs dépendront d'une continuation de temps propice en
                        Novensbre. </p>

                        passe </p>
                    <p>De la Haute-Egypte, il y a eu aussi des plaintes à cause de la température ;
                        mais, malgré tout, la récolte là-bas nous promet une forte augmentation sur
                        l'aunée préordente. </p>
                    <p>En résumé, et prenant l'ensemble des renseignements, la récolte semblerait
                        devoir etre a pet pres égale and celle de l'année dernière ; aussi notre
                        première estimation est-elle de Cantats 6,750,000 à 7,000,000. </p>

                        you are so highly successful there is little left to be desired. Your very

                    <p>L'aspect de notre corbeille n'a pas sensiblement différé de celui d'hier,
                        sinon en ce qu'il a présenté plus d'animation, il faudrait dire plus
                        d'empressement de la part des vendeurs. Malgré tout, les affaires sont
                        restées clairsemées et limitées aux Comptoir, Estates, Delta Land et en
                        proportions plus restreintés aux Agricole, National Bank, United et Ritz.
                        Pour quelques-unes de ces valeurs il est difficile de dire si le tapage a
                        donné lieu à des transactions. Dans ces conditions on comprend que la cote
                        sit subi une nouvelle moius-value. Cependant on a constaté en cours de
                        séance un peu d'amélioration sur les prix d'on verture. Notre marché, qui
                        n'a pas l'habitude de pécher par excès de pessimisme, espère qu'après les
                        fêtes du Balram nous aurons de meilleures nouvelles do dehors et qu'une
                        reprise se prodaira. Encha Allah. </p>

                    <p>On voit que la situation ne n'est pas améliorée jusqu'ici. Cependant, pourvu

                    <p>Il a été vendu ce matin aux enchères publiques 216 obligations Crédit Foncier
                        Egyptien, dont 113 anciennes à un prix moyen de 91 fr. 50 et 103 nouvelles à
                        une moyenne de 251 fr. 25. C'est à l'annonce de ventes forcées de ce genre
                        qu'on attribue en partie la dépression de notre marché : les détenteurs de
                        titres de la même société que ceux mis en vente cherchent, en effet, à
                        liquider leur stock en prévision de la baisse que ces ventes peuvent
                        occasionner. </p>
                    <p>Le bruit courait ce matin que des courtiers vendaient des titres d'une

                        les agents visés une vive altercation. </p>

                    <p>Le Caire, Mardi 3 Novembre.</p>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre est renseigné en hausse de 3/4 à 6 1/2 pour cent.
                        Une dépêche Reuter annonce que hier le Conseil de la Banque d'Angleterre a
                        décidé l'élévation du taux officiel de la Banque à 6%. </p>
                    <p>Au Stock-Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé hier de 1/8 à 81 7/8 et
                        l'Unifiée de 1/4 à 100. La National Bank a rétrogradé de 1/2 à 20 5/8 et la
                        Daira de 1 4 à 12 1/2. L'Agricole s'est maintenue à 8 1/8 et la Delta Light
                        à 10 1/4 </p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Pongier Egyptien a perdu 7 franes à 680. La Banque
                        d'Athènes est restée invariée à 106. Les Lots Tures se sont inscrits à 167,
                        en perte de 1 franc. </p>
                    <p>Ici, la légère amélioration d'hier n'a pu se maintenir et la séance de ce
                        matin, influencée par les mauvaises nouvelles d'Occident, a été nulle comme
                        transactions, bien qu'à vue de nez l'animation parut considérable tellement
                        les vendeurs mettaient de ceur à leur besogne. </p>
                    <p>Les prix bien entendu n'ont pas été favorables et la clôture a enregistré une
                        baisse assez sensible sur toutes les valeurs traitées, à une on deux
                        exceptions pres, les plus maltraitées ayant été les valeurs dirigeantes. </p>
                    <p>La situation actuelle apparait comme très explicable à ceux qui se rendent
                        compte de l'emoi causé au capital par les événements d'Amérique apres ceux
                        d'Allemagne et d'Angleterre, sans oublier l'Italie. </p>
                    <p>Pour le moment l'argent se'cache, mais tout a une fin et sous peu le capital
                        oubliant ses terreurs réclamers en Europe et ailleurs des placements
                        rémunérateurs. L'Egypte en profitera largement d'autant plus que l'élévation
                        du taux de l'escompte, à part un effet moral, ne peut avoir chez rious de
                        grandes conséquences, nos taux officiels étant de beaucoup supérieurs et en
                        tous temps à ceux demandes Lontres au moment les plus aigus des périodes
                        d'argent cher. </p>

                        obligation ancienne à 295 et la nouvelle à 253. La privilégiée Béhéra gagne
                        1 16 à 4 1/16. La Nile Land revient à 9 et le fondateurs Allotments à

                    <p>"Les brokers et banquiers de Londres sont généralement d'avis que la crise
                        américaine est passée et ils considèrent que les liquidations qui s'opèrent
                        à l'heure actuelle constituent un facteur favorable. D'après eux il va sans
                        dire que rien ne pourra faire mieux renaitre la confiance que l'estime pour
                        les aptitudes et le caractère des personnalités qui dirigent les grandes
                        entreprises industrielles. </p>
                    <p>"Avee M.J.P. Morgan à la tête de Wall Street, il est très probable que l'on
                        verra bientôt les choses sous un autre angle qu'aujourd'hui. En un mot,
                        malgré la hausse récente des tanx d'intérêts à 100 %, malgré les faillites
                        signelées, les perspectives paraissent un peu plus encourageantes. </p>
                    <p>"Evidemment, les reprises seront presque à coup sur suivies de liquidations,
                        mais tout bien consid-ré, les plus grosses difficultés paraissent maintenant
                        écartées. </p>

                        priori" on assistera à une reprise de mouvement ascensionnel des Etats-Unis.
                        Certes ce ne sont pas les énergies et les initiatives qui manquent de
                        l'autre côté de l'Atlantique, ce sont surtout les capitaux. Aussi ne faudra
                        t-il pas s'étonner que le situation monétaire mette quelque temps à
                        s'améliorer." </p>
