                    <head>EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT HOURS.</head>
                    <p> Next to the worry of having to live probably comes that of having to work,
                        and though we all like to live well we do not all care to work hard.
                        Business men and places often claim for themselves a superiority in this
                        respect which they do not deserve; there are many places in the world where
                        the life and work of the Government official are far harder than those
                        endured by members of the mercantile community, and for all we know to the
                        contrary some of these places may be in Egypt, But on the particular
                        question before<cb n="6"/>us we are glad to feel that Alexandria can proudly
                        hold up her head. In the matter of office-hours we have long been quite
                        European in having many of them and few holidays. In Cairo it has remained
                        different, and calculations, prompted by curiosity but made with knowledge,
                        have shown how small a number of full days' office work are contained in a
                        year, if the annual leave and all else be taken into consideration. Under
                        these circumstances we may not feel that sympathy which is probably expected
                        from us for those who are in danger of curtailment of their two whole and
                        five half holidays per week plus extras. We can, however, offer them
                        consolation even though it be of a passing nature. It appears that a certain
                        branch of a certain department of the State at Cairo is threatened with
                        afternoon office hours. The consolation we can offer is that it is, so far,
                        only a threat and limited in extent; the danger which is foreseen is that it
                        will become a reality and of general effect. The fact, which seems to have
                        escaped recognition, is that the principle already exists and it is its
                        extended application that is resented. Only a few whose ease it suited would
                        be found ready to argue that the Posts and Telegraphs, Railways, Trams,
                        Banks, and offices should not work sufficiently long and convenient hours;
                        it has proved to be possible to make it compulsory and to be easy to a
                        degree to effect the same object by voluntary attendance during the
                        afternoons in consideration of small extra allowances. It is thus placed
                        beyond doubt that no customs or habits peculiar to Egypt stand in the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>A fact that may require recognition is that salaries are or are supposed to
                        be-based upon the existing short hours in most Government departments, but
                        we are not prepared to take for granted that this is to be ignored. From
                        what we have learnt by such enquiries as we could make we are, on the
                        contrary, inclined to believe that the better quality as well as the larger
                        quantity of work from the individual is aimed at by the gentleman who is
                        making these disturbing proposals to Government, and if the present
                        increased cost of living can be met by a corresponding increase of work,
                        responsibility, and pay it seems to us the basis of a fair bargain. In
                        definitely concluding it we can well understand there is some difficulty:
                        there is sufficient ground for believing that some who can fall back on
                        pensions would not sacrifice their afternoon ease or engagements, and in
                        their case it may be sufficient ground for doubting whether an increased
                        quantity of work is of any increased value. On the whole, however, we
                        commend the idea, not only to the authorities, but to all concerned who mean
                        business, and we regard the present time as highly opportune, for the
                        enhanced cost of the necessaries of life compels a consideration of
                        salaries,</p>

                                the Government majority. The future Government must, however, con-

                        at docks. When the first season's transactions are completed the
                        shareholders will be asked to decide whether the company shall continue the
                        trade or be wound up.</p>

                    <head>THE HOLY CARPET.<lb/>CEREMONY OF DEPARTURE.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday, two companies of the 16th Batta lion Egyptian Army, with the
                        Infantry Band, paraded at El Gamalieh at 3.30 p.m. and escorted the Mahmal
                        as far as the Mastabat el Mahmal, in Mohamed Aly-square.</p>
                    <p>All Arab Cairo was in the streets at an early hour this morning to witness
                        the departure of the Holy Carpet, and great numbers of visitors and
                        residents lined the route followed, and occupied every point of vantage that
                        commanded a good view of the people and the procession.</p>
                    <p>H.H. the Khedive came up from Koubbeh to Pount Limoun station at 9 a.m. and
                        at about 10 a.m. the booming of guns announced his arrival at Mohamed
                        Aly-square to preside over the ceremony. His Highness drove up in a State
                        coach preceded and followed by a Cavalry escort.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the Egyptian force in garrison had paraded in honor of the
                        occasion, the Infantry in line without intervals between companies, the
                        Artillery in line at half-intervals on the right flank of the Infantry, the
                        Cavalry and Maxim section in line on the right flank facing inwards, and the
                        16th Battalion in line on the left flank facing inwards. The troops, who
                        were in review order, presented a very smart appearance.</p>
                    <p>Many of the principal residents of Cairo, as well as the Ministers, were
                        present at the ceremony, which was watched with the greatest interest. The
                        Khedive handed the insignia of the Mahmal, with the ceremonial usual on such
                        occasions, to the Emir el Hag.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards the Sacred Carpet and its escort wended their way towards
                        Abbassieh, where they will remain until their departure for Suez, there to
                        embark on a Khedivial steamer for Jeddah.</p>

                    <p>Judgment was delivered yesterday by the Alexandria Native Summary Court in
                        the libel action brought by the well-known native milliners, Messrs. Yousef
                        and Ahmed Bey el-Gammal, against the editor of El Tamcil. The defendant
                        stated in his newspaper that large numbers of native ladies and girls used
                        to resort to the shop as a rendez-vous, and that the proprietors used to
                        invite young men to their establishment in Midan-street with a view to
                        meeting fair female customers. The newspaper concluded its scandalous
                        imputations by saying it would publish more revelations the next week. The
                        article was published a fortnight ago and Messrs. Gammal at once commenced
                        proceedings.</p>
