                    <head>THE STORM-SWEPT BALKANS.</head>
                    <p> Mr. Fisher Unwin has just published a new work on the Near East, which gives
                        us some interesting side-lights on the present position of affairs in the
                        Balkan Peninsula. The author, who witholds his identity on the ground that
                        much of the information given to him was of a confidential nature, and
                        because the work contains "many plain truths and much out spoken criticism,"
                        apparently had every oppor tunity of studying the situation first-hand. He
                        was the bearer of despatches from the British Government and had
                        introductions which obtained for him audiences of the kings and princes of
                        the Balkan states, the Sultan of Turkey, and the highest officials in
                        various cabinets. At the outset he makes the frank confession that "the
                        writer who attempts to place the various Balkan questions impartially and
                        clearly before the public will at once find himself utterly confused, and
                        wallowing wildly in a morass of roisstatement and misrepresenta tion. The
                        Balkans torn by race-hatreds, party strife, and the intrigues of the
                        Powers." This accurate description of the position in the storin-swept
                        Peninsula is followed up by the equally frank statement that "much that w's
                        told me in one country was contradicted in the next," so that, even for an
                        observer who had so free an entry to the inner circles of diplomacy, the
                        difficulties of getting at the truth were anything but slight. The writer
                        visited in turn Montenegro, Northern Albania, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina,
                        Servia, Bulgaria, Rou mania, Turkey, and Macedonia, and he gives as a vivid
                        description of the unrest and race feuds everywhere prevalent.' Austria and
                        Ger many figure throughout the book as dominat ing and sinister influences.
                        The author bluntly accuses the two powers of competing for the supremacy in
                        the Balkans. "The Austrian Eagle has overshadowed and grasped Bosnia, she
                        has ber talons into Servia, and is casting covetous glances upon gallant
                        little Monte negro." Germany, on the other hand, is pursu ing her rôle of
                        Defender of the Faithful to such a successful degree that her influence at
                        Yildiz is paramount, and the tragedy of Macedonia is quietly ignored.
                        Austria is de nounced for adopting "Russian" methods in order to bring about
                        the subjugation of Bosnia. The peasantry are oppressed, and subject to an
                        elaborate system of 'espionage, and the liberty of the press is unknown.
                        Austria, we are further told, is also responsible for the adverse criticisms
                        of King Peter's rule in Servià which have appeared in the London press, the
                        correspondents being in the pay of the Austrian Government. </p>
                    <p>This seems very astonishing, but not inore so than the author's fattery of
                        King Peter, who is held up to us as a patriot without guile. </p>
                    <p>Both Servia and Bulgaria, it is interest ing to note, are anxious for British
                        capital to be introduced in order to exploit their mineral resources, and
                        bona fide applications for concessions are welcomed. The author says that
                        from information which he gather ed the opinion seemed to be unanimo's that
                        the troubles still existing between Bulgaria and Turkey over Macedonia are
                        in no way decreasing, but rather the contrary, and he <hi rend="italic"
                            >g</hi>oes so far as to predict that war is inevitable batween these two
                        countries, and that hostilities will probably break out before the end of
                        the year. An important factor in the situation, he says, is Roumania.

                        result of the war, annexes any Macedonian territory, then she should cede to
                        Roumania that portion of her territory lying between the Danube and the
                        Black Sea, taking a line from a little east of Varna. Such a condition is
                        certainly not to be viewed in Bulgaria with any satisfaction, yet as its
                        acceptance wonld mean the extension of Bulgaria to the Adriatic, the
                        settlement of the Macedonian question, and the final destruction of Turkey
                        as a power in Europe, the Bulgarian Cabinet are considering it very
                        carefully." This seems a very ambi- tious programme, with regard to the
                        execution of which the European powers might reasonably be expected to have
                        something to say. The Sultan and the high officials view the outlook with
                        their usual philosophical calm. The writer's opinion is that Turkey is
                        uncertain of the attitude of Servia and Roumania, and is rather mystified as
                        to what Austria will in the event of war. Relying upon Germany, and treating
                        Great Britain with studied politeness, she views the present critical
                        situation with perfect indifference." The prospect is anything but
                        reassuring. We are given a terrible picture of wholesale massacres, and the
                        latest informa- tion to hand shows that the "reforms" have done little to
                        check the operations of the Greek bands, who are spreading misery and death
                        in all directions. What will be the end of it all is difficult to forecast.
                        Sir Edward Grey the other day received an influential deputation headed by
                        the Arch- bishop of Canterbary, who urged the necessity of European control
                        in Macedonia, but he could give them but cold comfort. He had to admit that
                        in spite of what had been done to restore order the condition of things in
                        Macedonia remained much the same as before, and the situation was now
                        complicated by internecine warfare. The proposal that a Euro- pean
                        Governor-General should be appointed he considered impracticable. To attempt
                        to secure it by isolated action on the part of Great Britain would result in
                        international complica tions. This is obviously the fact, and the other
                        members of the Concert would naturally resent any attempt at individual
                        action by the British Government, were such action possible. It now remains
                        to be seen whether the increase of the Customs dues will bring about any
                        better supervision of this unhappy country, and we await with interest the
                        proposals for reform which Austria and Russia are expected to make in the
                        course of the present summer. Professor Agoura, of Sofia University, suggest
                        ed to the author that the best settlement would be a restrained autonomy,
                        that would not separate Macedoins from Turkey. Macedonia. should be placed
                        under a European Governor- General, preferably a Swiss, in whom the central
                        administration should be vested, all other questions being left to Turkey.

                        countries under survey, and is illustrated by a number of excel- lent

                            princess. Despite the fact that the mummy is believed to be more than
                            3,400 years old, and is one of the very few perfect specimens still
                            remaining outside the museums, it failed to attract the attention of any
                            notable Egyptologists, and after a languid bidding was knocked down for
                            the sum of thirteen guineas.</p>

                        <p>The auction sale of building sites offered by the Government at Omdurman
                            took place on the 8th inst. at Omdurman zaptieh. Eight leasehold sites
                            were offered in the "suk," and bids for these went up high. As much as
                            £1 per sq. metre was the average premium paid for these sites. Evidently
                            the purchasers needed the sites for their business and had no
                            speculation in view. The freehold sites offered at the Mulazimin quarter
                            realized about 10 or 12 P.T. per square metre, which is not very bad,
                            considering the extent of territory at Omdurman that is available for
                            building sites.</p>

                        instance was forthcoming. We understand that no further clue has resulted
                        from the investigations of the police.</p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER'S MEMORIAL.<lb/>ANGLO-EGYPTIAN INDIFFERENCE</head>
                    <p>Considerable attention has been drawn by the foreign and native local Press
                        to the letter of Mr. R.J. Moss, which recently appeared in our columns on
                        the subject of the attitude of the members of the Anglo-Egyptian Colony at
                        Alexandria to the question of a memorial to Lord Cromer. Out of one thousand
                        circulars letters addressed to British residents in Alexandria asking for
                        their opinion as to the form the testimonial to Lord Cromer should take,
                        only 29 replies were received.</p>
                    <p>The facts given in Mr. Moss's letter admit of only one interpretation, which
                        is that the persons to whom the letters were adressed were so indifferent to
                        the matter that they never took the trouble to give any thought to them.
                        This attitude of indifference is deserving of notice, because the British
                        Colony at Alexandria is the most important non-official section of
                        Anglo-Egyptians in the country. They represent the permanent section of the
                        English population of Egypt far more than the Anglo- Egyptian official
                        inhabitants of Cairo. It would therefore be thought that here, if anywhere,
                        such an appeal as that made by Mr. Moss would have been readily responded
                        to. The appeal, however, failed completely in its object. One local
                        contemporary in drawing attention to this interesting fact remarks "Sie
                        transit gloria mundi." Another contemporary enunciates the following theory
                        for this indifference :-</p>
                    <p>It appears that the English Colony are not of the same opinion as their
                        heads, or are not satisfied with the pioneers of the occupation. With the
                        object of erecting a monument to the memory of Lord Cromer, one of these
                        addressed a circular to 130 of his compatriots and only received 29 answers
                        to his appear. We have looked for the reasons for this ill-feeling towards
                        Lord Cromer and his policy. The English Colony did not enjoy the
                        consideration which extended by their authorities towards the various
                        European Colonies, Italian, French, and German. The English nation is
                        represented in Egypt by Government officials to the exclusion of the
                        colonists to such a point that Lord Cromer imported the employés directly
                        from England. English business men have not found in Egypt the help which
                        they hoped for. These are the reasons which made them hate the Cromerian
                        administration.</p>

                    <p>"Al-Watan" says:-</p>
                    <p>A case will in all probability be brought before the native tribunal at one
                        of the centres of Upper Egypt in which the hand of secret societies is bound
                        to appear. It will be remembered that the principal aim of these societies
                        is to boycott British goods in general. Our friends of the Nationalist party
                        hastened to refute our news whenever we published a line on this subject;
                        but they let the cat out of the bag last month when they enjoined upon their
                        Mohamedan brethren in the columns of "Al- Lewa" to buy no goods from
                        foreigners and take all they require "from their brother even if his goods
                        were bad and dear." This fact was pointed out by us at the time when
                        "Al-Lewa" attempted a lame explanation that did not satisfy its own
                        supports. Now that a law-suit is pending with the boycotting of foreign
                        goods by two members of a secret society as its raison d'être it will be
                        hard, even for "Al-Lewa" to explain the matter away. We hope to give more
                        details on this law-suit and the working of secret societies on a future
                        date. The Cairo correspondent of the "Pall Mall Gazette" agrees with us that
                        the frequency of complaints and accusations and, the evident pains to which
                        the Nationalist Press has gone in every instance to refute them, show that
                        they are not ill-founded. Our able contemporary will, no doubt, find
                        additional proofs in the open letter published by "Al-Lewa" to which we have
                        referred and in the coming law-suit which we are promised in a few days. We
                        in our turn, agree with the correspondent of the "Pall Mall Gazette" that
                        the Government is fully informed of what is happening and that its secret
                        service men are distributed all over the country. But in certain cases these
                        secret agents are utterly useless, either from wanton duplicity or from
                        crass imbecility. Morcover, the proverbial indifference and inaction of our
                        Government in all matters connected with the anti-English movement have
                        assumed alarming proportions. If the London Press well help to move our
                        authorities to action in these questions a great danger may be smothered
                        before it grows too tough.</p>

                    <head>THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.<lb/>THE CRISIS AND THE COTTON CROP.</head>
                    <p>Under the above heading "C.R." has in a recent issue of "La Reforme"
                        discussed the position of the coming staple export crop of Egypt with
                        reference to the cultivator, the export buyer, the speculator, and the
                        banker; and the conclusion at which he arrives is what we should have
                        expected from any one inoculated with the financial heresies of "La
                        Reforme," viz: "that, the time has arrived for the Government to intervene
                        and place at the disposal of the National Bank sufficient funds to enable
                        that institution to make large advances etc. etc." but our contemporary's
                        nostrum, so frequently prescribed, and now adopted by 'C.R.,' is too well
                        known to require completion.</p>
                    <p>On this occasion the appeal is more earnest than ever and the Government are
                        solemnly warned that if they fail to apply the prescription of La Reforme
                        then "the fellah's interests will suffer cruelly and the crisis will become,
                        frightfully acute and general; the striken fellah will fall into arrears in
                        the payment of his taxes" and at the culmination of this disaster the very
                        credit of the Government itself may be shaken!! From this appalling picture
                        we turn to a consideration of the conditions of the cotton cultivation in
                        Egypt which "C.R." has clearly and accurately set forth and while the
                        conclusions at which we have arrived are very different, we claim to have
                        given the subject as serious consideration as "C.R." has done, and to have
                        consulted the opinions of those we consider most entitled to respect.</p>
                    <p>We find the situation calls for the exercise of prudence and judgment, but we
                        fail to see any occasion for alarm or fear that the business capacity of the
                        exporters engaged in the cotton trade will prove inadequate to financing the
                        crop without prejudice to the interest of the fellah and without upsetting
                        the money market.</p>
                    <p>It is unnecessary to follow "C.R." into his explanation of the modus operandi
                        by which exporters, who sell ahead of the season to spinners abroad, cover
                        their sales by contract purchases against fluctuations of the market.</p>
                    <p>His explanation is perfectly lucid and any one of our readers who is
                        unacquainted with the operation will do well to study the explanation given
                        on the subject in "La Réforme" of the 15th inst.</p>
                    <p>From the comments of "C.R." we might be led to believe that exporters of
                        cotton are compelled this year to cover their sales abroad by purchase of
                        contracts, owing to insufficiency of funds to purchase in the country from
                        the fellaheen, and it is on this point especially that we join issue with
                        "C.R." as we believe him to be entirely misinformed.</p>
                    <p>It appears to us that he has jumped to this conclusion owing to the recent
                        exposure of some of the difficulties which confront the exporters in
                        covering their sales by contracts.</p>
                    <p>Of course it is impossible for the exporters to cover in the interior, during
                        the summer months, the large sales made abroad as promptly as during the
                        cotton season, hence recourse to contracts purchased on the bourse for
                        temporary cover of their sales: and what has occurred this year in the way
                        of purchase of contracts is in no way singular, but merely what is done
                        every year, though perhaps to a larger extent this year, because, as "C.R."
                        remarks, forward sales have been very heavy.</p>
                    <p>It is generally estimated that one third of the coming crop has already been
                        sold, a great part of which has been purchased or engaged from the fellaheen
                        and the balance covered by contract.</p>
                    <p>Any difficulty that the exporter may experience arises from the fact that
                        brokers, knowing the enormous losses made by speculators, are unwilling to
                        deal in contracts. But "C.R." apparently fails to realise that, at this
                        period of the year, cotton shippers have much, if not most, of their own
                        capital free and hence have very little need of recourse to the local banks
                        for assistance. Now as to the cultivator, so far from the fellah being the
                        object of our sympathy, we are inclined to regard him with feelings akin to
                        envy.</p>
                    <p>The Government by the guarantee of a further sum of one million sterling has
                        enabled the Agricultural Bank to increase its working capital to that extent
                        during the past few months, which sum is available for the cultivator, and
                        this favoured individual can dispose of his crop if he so desires at $20 per
                        cantar resulting in a profit of anything up to 100% on his outlay. And it is
                        on his behalf that the Government are invited to place huge sums of gold
                        with the National Bank of Egypt Ld., in order to enable him to pay his taxes
                        and so save the credit of the Government itself!!!</p>
                    <p>We think that we have made it evident that the position of the felaheen need
                        cause anxiety neither to the Government nor to any one else.</p>
                    <p>The individual whose position is actually precarious is the speculative
                        seller of cotton, whose calculations of lower prices have been completely
                        upset by the poor prospects of the American crop and the consequent advance
                        in the price of Egyptian, and it is in his interest that the recent decision
                        of the Committee of the Bourse is being engineered. But even if the
                        speculative spirit be paralysed and exporters be unable to purchase
                        contracts for futures, we fail to see how the cotton trade of the country
                        can be ultimately damaged. The fellah will either sell his crop at a fixed
                        price for forward delivery, or he will wait until it has been marketed.
                        Probably in fear that a glut may occur if he waits too long he will sell
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>As regards financing, the crop is virtually financed by the spinners whether
                        British, American or Continental, the accomodation <cb n="4"/> extended by
                        the banks here being merely of a temporary nature and quickly repaid by the
                        exporters. Last year owing to the early and heavy arrivals of the crop, and
                        to its unexpected value, the Banks found themselves unprepared for the
                        demand made on the stock of gold which they had provided: but there is
                        little fear of any such state of unpreparedness this year. We have every
                        reason to believe that a larger stock of gold exists in the vaults of the
                        Banks in Egypt to-day, than at any previous period: and this hoarding is not
                        for the luxury of the thing, but to provide for all contingencies of every
                        nature whatever.</p>
                    <p>The large export houses too, have carefully scrutinised and forecasted the
                        position, and we feel confident that nothing has been left to chance which
                        can be controlled by prudence and forethought.</p>
                    <p>We understand "C.R.'s" assertion to be that bills drawn in Egypt are at
                        present viewed askance in European centres, but this cannot possibly refer
                        to cotton transactions, for the capital of the exporters is intact. They
                        have enjoyed a prosperous year and their credit never stood higher than
                        to-day in consequence.</p>
                    <p>The fellaheen's wealth is greater this year than last and the value of land,
                        his only investment, is not depreciated: Therefore the condition of the
                        cotton business is sufficiently sound all round for no cause of any
                        anxiety.</p>
                    <p>It is in no censorious spirit that we have dealt with "C.R.'s" remarks for we
                        believe them to be the honest outcome of careful investigation. None the
                        less we do believe his conclusions to be erroneous and to be fraught with
                        danger, inasmuch as they may be read and accepted abroad, being shielded
                        under the aegis of our respected contemporary "La Reforme." We consider that
                        unnecessarily alarmist reports and reiterated appeals to the Government for
                        unnecessary aid are calculated to damage Egyptian credit and to counteract
                        these mischievous if honest appeals we shall continue to direct our untiring
                        energies.</p>

                    <p>The Paris "Temps" publishes an article concerning the resignation of M.
                        Lambert, a Frenchman, from the directorate of the Khedivial School of
                        Law.</p>
                    <p>After calling in question the qualifications of Mr. Hill, the Englishman by
                        whom M. Lambert has been superseded, the "Temps" says: "The supplanting of a
                        Frenchman by an Englishman is correct according to the letter of the law,
                        but it is not very just, friendly, or clever. It is not just, because the
                        School of Law is an essentially French institution: not friendly, as being
                        contrary to the mutual engagements between France and Great Britain, and to
                        the agreement of April 8th, 1904; not clever, since the decision is not in
                        consonance with the general trend of British policy."</p>
                    <p>The "Temps" asserts that what it describes as "the vexations" of Mr. Dunlop
                        drove M. Lambert to resign, and goes on to urge favoured treatment for the
                        French in Egypt, who represent considerable material and moral interests.
                        "The mutual confidence which characterises Anglo-French relations," it
                        concludes, "impels us to say quite frankly that there is no justification,
                        no explanation, and no excuse for the treatment inflicted on us by officials
                        of the Dunlop school."</p>
                    <p>The following telegram has been sent to M. Pichon, Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs, Paris, by Messrs. Caneri and Vaast, deputies of the French Nation:"
                        Not only as regards ourselves personally, but in the name of the whole
                        French Colony in Cairo, we wish it to be brought to your notice that we
                        cannot agree with the opinions expressed by Sir Edward Grey in the House of
                        Commons on July 16 as regards the Affaire Lambert and the directorship of
                        the Khedivial School of Law at Cairo. We express our wish that the post in
                        question be allotted to a Frenchman. The entente cordiale will be void of
                        any real signification unless our interests in Egypt be provided for.</p>

                    <p>Our Army and Navy correspondent writes from London:- According to present
                        arrangements, the 1st Battalion of the Alexandria Princess of Wales's Own
                        Yorkshire Regiment, familiarly known as the "Green Howards," will embark on
                        the S.S. "Soudan," at Southampton, about the 16th January for Alexandria,
                        Egypt. The battalion, which will relieve the 2nd Battalion Royal
                        Inniskilling Fusiliers at Cairo, will detach one company for duty in Cyprus.
                        The "Soudan" will also carry out various drafts and details for Gibraltar,
                        Malta and Egypt. The Green Howards were in the Soudan Frontier operations of
                        1884, and participated in the action of Giniss. Lieutenant Colonel E. M.
                        Esson, who now commands the battalion, was then a subaltern of the
                        battalion.</p>
                    <p>In some recent instructions issued by the Army Council in regard to the
                        procedure to be adopted in carrying out reliefs, it is pointed out that in
                        years past the non-commissioned officers posted in relief to the service
                        units abroad have, in some cases, been very young soldiers, who on joining
                        their units have found themselves senior in rank to non commissioned offices
                        of greater experience and length of service. The Council has directed that
                        in selecting reliefs officers in charge of records are to send out
                        non-commissioned officers of more equal length of service and seniority, so
                        far as it is possible to do this without detriment to the requirements of
                        units at home.</p>

                        <dateline>Larnaca, July 11, 1907.</dateline>
                        <p>The British Fleet has come and gone, and those few officers who were
                            privileged to spend a few days on Troodos will doubtless regret that
                            their stay could not have been longer. The majority of the officers
                            being unable to visit the mountain station, preferred, and wisely so, to
                            remain mostly on board ship, landing only for a little walking or riding
                            exercise.</p>
                        <p>The Bluejackets can have found little to attract them on land, as at this
                            time of year no entertainments could be arranged for their amusement.
                            Certainly the pleasantest hours out of the twenty four must at this
                            season of the year be those spent in bathing, and very thoroughly did
                            they seem to enjoy it, prolonging their aquatic exercises well through
                            the afternoons..</p>
                        <p>H.M.S. 'Venerable' and H.M.S. 'Prince of Wales' have been anchored in
                            these roadsteads, the former being the Flagship of Rear-Admiral H.R.H.
                            Prince Louis of Battenberg. The Prince is already well known in this
                            town where he is highly popular, and where his commanding presence and
                            affable manners have won for him the admiration and the good opinion of
                            all the inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>The bands of both vessels came on shore and played selections of music in
                            the afternoons, much to the delight and appreciation of the
                            townspeople.</p>

                        <p>Much trouble and inconvenience has been caused to residents in the chief
                            towns by the sudden cessation last week of the ice deliveries from the
                            new ice factory here, due we believe, to a temporary breakdown in the
                            machinery. The ice was in good demand and those who had become
                            accustomed to its use have felt the deprivation severely. The usual
                            consignments of snow from the Troodos 'snowpits' had this year been
                            stopped in order that the new ice venture might not be unduly interfered
                            with, and Nicosia residents are therefore not able even to fall back on
                            that alternative. We hope the production and delivery of ice will soon
                            be recommenced.</p>

                            also received promotion, having received a police appointment in Uganda.
                            He is proceeding by this mail to England, for the purpose of undergoing

                            has accepted a similar appointment in Bishop Blyth's schools, Cairo, and
                            will be proceeding to Egypt this autumn. The Rev. Cooke-Collis-Smith,
                            who is vacating the Chaplaincy of the Anglican Church in Nicosia, is

                    <p>According to a note received by the Municipality on the subject of the
                        projected esplanade from Fort Silsileh to Mustapha from Mr. Lloyd Davies,
                        chief engineer, it is impossible to criticise in detail the project from the
                        construction point of view, but taking it from the general point of an
                        engineer the plan is well laid out and there is no question as to its
                        practicability. It would, indeed, greatly improve the coast from Fort
                        Silsileh to Mustapha. Mr. Lloyd Davies sees no technical objection to the
                        project, but suggests that the plans should be subjected to the Municipality
                        before the concession is granted, and that the work should be conducted
                        under its supervision</p>

                        croissante des offres de vente. A mesure que les prix fléchissent, de
                        nouveaux létenteurs se voient pris dans l'engrenage et, encore une fois, il
                        est impossible de prévoir exactement où s'arrêtera la déroute. C'est panique
                        qu'il faudrait dire, car l'ensemble de la spéculation ne raisonne plus. On
                        vend m!me De qu'on n'a pas. Il est acquis, en effet, que beaucoup vendent le
                        jour même ce qu'ils espè rent racheter le lendemain à meilleur compte, et
                        l'opération leur réussit à merveille. C'est pour cela qu'ils sont
                        embarrassés de livrer im médiatement à leurs achetenrs. Il nous semble, pour
                        prévenir cet abus, que les acquéreurs tevraient insister sur la livraison
                        immédiate on annuler l'opération. De cette façon les ven deurs en blanc,
                        risquant trop de garder les titres pour compte, ne voudraient plus se livrer
                        &amp; une combinaison aussi hasardeuse. </p>
                    <p>D'autre part, il est clair que les détenteurs de valeurs en sont à jouer leur
                        dernier carte. A délant d'autres titres aisément négociables, ils se voient
                        obligés de se défaire des obligations Crédit Foncier, anciennes et
                        nouvelles. C'est la seule explication plausible à la dégringolade rapide de
                        ces obligations qui s'inscrivent au jourd'hui à 285 l'ancienne et 251 la
                        nouvelle, en perte respective de 9 et 4 francs. Pour en arriver là il faut
                        que l'épargne soit forcée dans jes derniers retranchements. </p>

                    <p>Ainsi qu'il fallait s'y attendre, la tendance à la faiblesse s'est accentuée

                        Certes, les baissiers sont favorisés par un concours extraordinaire de
                        circonstances et conservent indiscutablement le beau rôle ; mais ils n'en
                        profitent guère, la stagnation battant son plein. Les offres trouvent de
                        moins en moins les contre-parties ; la dépression ne s'exerce que grâce aux
                        ventes forcées et aux exécutions, qui ne tarderont pas elles-mêmes à prendre
                        forcément fin, étant donné que, tout compte fait, ce jeu de massacre est
                        appelé à tourner 10, détriment des exécutants - qui auraient cout intérêt à
                        attendre — plutôt qu'à celui les condamnés. Il n'en demeure pas moins que
