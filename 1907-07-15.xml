                    <head>THE DISEASE OF THE AGE.</head>
                    <p>Dr. C. W. Saleeby, who is such a fascinating writer on scientific matters,
                        has just published through Cassells &amp; volume of the deepest in terest,
                        entitled "Worry: The Disease of the Age" (6s.). In this he points out the
                        significance, the consequences, and the cures of <cb n="6"/>worry, and in so
                        doing he touches on a wide range of subjects of vital importance to the
                        public well-being. All interested in religious and social questions will
                        find the book most informative and suggestive. </p>
                    <p>"To worry is to miss the purpose of one's being," Dr. Saleeby boldly
                        declares. "It is to fail--to fail for self, to fail for others, and it is to
                        fail gratnitously. But the blunder is universal, and it is the
                        characteristic symptom of an age which I believe to be the greatest in human
                        history hitherto. To the evolutionist no other belief is open." </p>
                    <p>"What has not been sufficiently recognised is the importance of worry, not
                        merely in itself as implying the absence of happiness, but as the cause of
                        ills far greater than itselfthe cause predisposing to disease which would
                        otherwise have been escaped altogether... As man becomes more
                        self-conscious, and therefore more human, so he becomes more liable to that
                        disease of the mind which is certainly unique in this respect, that alone of
                        all human diseases there is no analogy to it whatever in the case of any of
                        the lower animals. :.. Nowadays many cannot stand the psychical strain. They
                        are injured partly by fatigue, partly by worry. It is a proved and accepted
                        physiological truth that the adult is much more gravely injured by worry
                        than by fatigue. Hence our nerve doctors are kept busy. Hence the incessant
                        discovery of new nervous diseases." </p>
                    <p>Dr. Saleeby does not believe that mere mental overwork ever killed or injured
                        anybody. "Brain work in a stuffy room will kill you of tuberculosis ; brain
                        work plus worry has killed thousands, brain work plus worry, plus in. somnia
                        many thousands more ; but if the brain work had been omitted, the impure air
                        or the worry and the consequent loss of sleep would have had just the same
                        result." But Dr. Saleeby points out that insanity is in no small measure a
                        consequence of worry. Farther, "the consequences of worry in relation to
                        ordinary physical disease are familiar to every physician. Not a few
                        non-infectious diseases are known which seem frequently to be predisposed to
                        be worry. Among these are gout, diabetes, and a certain form of goitre." </p>
                    <p>The many ways in which worry manifests itself is shown in a succession of
                        chapters deal. ing with worry in illness; worry and boredom; worry, drugs
                        and drink; worry, and action ; worry in childhood ; domestic worry; worry
                        and old age ; worry and sex; the psychology of worry. And all these are full
                        of striking illustrations. </p>
                    <p>In writing of "Worry and Disease," Dr. Saleeby says:</p>
                    <p>The piles of crutches at Lourdes indicate real cures of real diseases. The
                        cures wrought by Christian Science are real cures. Faith| healing is a fact.
                        Neither faith nor Mrs. Eddy can remove mountains - or kill a bacillus-but
                        mind can act on mind. Terrible maladies exist which the united wisdom of
                        every physician on the earth might be impotent to affect, but which would
                        yield instantly and finally to the nonsensical jabbering of an immoral
                        imbecile if only the patient's mind were affected thereby. These are
                        scientific facts, as certain and as, important as the infectiousness of
                        cholera, the germ causation of tuberculosis, or the triumphs of Listerian
                        surgery. </p>
                    <p>In another place, speaking of Christian Science, he says : </p>
                    <p>If proof of the power of the mind in relation to hysteria and all forms of
                        fanctional nervons disease be desired, the mere progress of Christian
                        Science will provide it. Christian Science is increasing, and is even
                        threatening, as Mark Twain declares, to become the dominant religion,
                        because it meets a real need. It teaches that to worry and to fear must be
                        attributed all the ills that flesh is heir to. And this is true of such an
                        amazing proportion of these ills that Christian Science cures them. The
                        religion that has this kind of survival value will survive. </p>
                    <p>One of the worries peculiar to our own time is due to our thought of the
                        future of the race. "No idea of a duty to posterity, no recognition of the
                        fact that the present is not only the child of the past but also the parent
                        of the future, played much part in the thoughts of our ancestors." The
                        writer says he has no space for an essay on "Anxious Patriotism and Worried
                        Patriots," but he does point out that "concern about the future of the race
                        is not merely a form of worry new to our time, nor yet is it merely a new
                        and elevated form of moral sentiment; it is a force that makes for action.
                        ... Our children's chilIren will rise up and call us blessed; this rery
                        generation will be remembered as the irst which consciously and deliberately
                        made he future its own highest concern," </p>

                        <p>The learning of the ancient Greeks has not yet after 2,000 years yielded
                            up the last of its secrets. It is claimed for a Danish scientist, M.
                            Heiberg, that he has quite recently discovered in a palimpsest in
                            Constantinople a bitherto unknown work on mathematics by Archimedes. The
                            MS., which is entitled "On Method," and is dedicated to Eratosthenes,
                            relates (says the "Globe") to the applying of mechanics to the solution
                            of certain problems in geometry. To be brief, there is in this ancient
                            Greek MS., developed with remarkable boldness, a method that may be said
                            to bear a strong resemblance to the integral calculus of onr modern
                            days, and capable of being used for the solution of problems reserved
                            for the genius of Leibnitz and Newton eighteen centuries later. </p>

                        Chairman, Alfred Nabman, E. Mercinier, who represented the firm of Arditi,
                        Dimitri Caralli, Alfred Salinas, F. B. Rossano and Victor Levi, members. Mr.
                        Clement Suares opened the meeting and stated that he had received a petition
                        signed by the majority of the meinbers of the Association, dated 22nd June
                        last, wherein it was stated that owing to the peculiar position of the
                        Egyptian market in the present crisis it was necessary to safeguard the
                        collective interests. Accordingly on that date the commmittee of the
                        Alexandria Bourse decided to Suspend operations in dealing in the shares of
                        the company in question. The petitioners were in favour of regulating the
                        dealings in the following way. All transactions at £1 and over were to be
                        considered valid without delivery of the shares, and the value of the shares
                        was to be considered as being actually on a basis of £1. Transactions under
                        £1 were to be treated at the price made without delivery of shares. The
                        chairman then asked if anyone present wished to make any remarks. Mr.
                        Rodocanachi said that he was willing to abide by the conditions laid down in
                        the petition, he was ready to lose what he had lost, but he could not allow
                        others to 'benefit thereby. He suggested that the profits realised should be
                        lumped together. Mr. Nahmann said it was impossible to exactly ascertain the
                        individual position of each person. He remarked that very few persons would
                        profit by the arrangement. The chairman then asked Mr. Rodocanachi not to
                        persist in bringing forward a motion and in consequence of further
                        explanations from Mr. Nahman, Mr. Rodocanachi gave way. Mr. Rossano next
                        suggested that the delivery of the shares should not take place until six
                        months hence. He said that if the public interested were not in agreement,
                        and if the shares were delivered now, their clients could insist on a
                        settlement by presenting their shares. We brokers are, he said, doing a
                        favour to the Company by our policy and the Company ought to show its
                        gratitude to us by witholding the shares for from three to six months. Mr.
                        Nahman said that if legal proceedings were resorted to by the persons
                        interested, they would meet with many obstacles and all dealings had to
                        conform to the rules of the Bourse. Mr. Mirissi supported Mr. Rossano and
                        said that supposing their clients came to them with the shares in their
                        hands after the time proposed, what could they do? The question of the
                        founders shares must be settled now. Mr. Nahman said that Arditi had given
                        up nearly 3,000 founders shares and that these shares would probably
                        afterwards come into the possession of the Association. It would, he said,
                        be interesting to ascertain who were the real losers. Mr. Mirissi said that
                        everybody naturally was trying to do the best for their own interests.
                        Maitre Mercinier after some discussion said that the question was of
                        settling the differences and the original subscribers would keep their
                        shares. A person said that the original subscribers in some cases could not
                        keep their shares, as in certain cases the bank would insist on delivery of
                        the shares due to them. Maitre Mercinier answered that the scheme would
                        apply to all, banks as well. If the proposal was adopted it would be
                        beneficial. Brokers could not be made bankrupt as they were protected by the
                        decision of the association, and that the project must be adopted in view of
                        the intense crisis now existing. If the parties interested went to law with
                        their brokers, the latter could not be declared insolvent. It was a question
                        for the law to decide, and either party could gain the day in the law
                        courts. The dealings in this Company's shares were abnormal. As transactions
                        in the shares had taken place before the shares arrived, the settlement
                        could be postponedindefinitely by the directors of the Company. The Company
                        had made a proposal, if the parties interested did not care to accept it,
                        they could go to law. But, he said, an arrangement, even a bad one, was
                        better than a long lawsuit. The scheme' proposed was loyal, honest, and
                        salutary and he advised the brokers to tell their clients that they did not
                        refuse to settle, but only wanted to follow the regulations, After further
                        observation by Mr. Gessarian, Mr. Nahman, etc., the Chairman proposed that
                        the dissentients should raise their hands. Some isolated individuals did so
                        and at the same time energetically protested against the scheme, but the
                        majority being in favour of it, the Chairman declared the project
                        carried.</p>
                    <p>All the interest this morning in the Bourse was concentrated on this meeting
                        and transactions were very few.</p>

                    <p>MURDER OR SUICIDE ?</p>
                    <p>The mysterious death of Vivante, who was found lying dead against a bed-pos
                        in a room of an Alexandrian hotel is the subject of comment throughout the
                        city Vivante entered the hotel at half past on on Friday morning in company
                        with his cousin, Nacamuli. The bowab saw both mer enter and Vivante and
                        Nacamuli went to the room of the former, where the latte remained for a
                        quarter of an hour befort going to bed. During the night Nacamul heard no
                        noise, but this fact is of ni account as his room was at the other end of
                        the hotel. About three o'clock a jewelle who had taken a room at the hotel
                        next to Vivante's heard a noise like the falling of a body, and at the same
                        time he heard a shriek Being disturbed by the noise he listenec for a
                        moment, but hearing nothing furthe he paid no more attention</p>
                    <p>Up to five o'clock in the morning no one else left the hotel, but at that
                        time the boal noticed a young, fair man, of medium stature go out, who had
                        taken a room the night before</p>
                    <p>About 8.10 a.m. the servant attending Vivante called him, but receiving no
                        answer, he opened the door, which the deceased never locked on account of
                        his being very asthmatic, and found Vivante at the foot of his bed with a
                        rope round his neck. The room was not disarranged in the slightest degree,
                        every. thing was in order, and there was no trace of toul play have taken
                        place.</p>
                    <p>The rope which was found round the de ceased's neck had no knot in it but was
                        drawn very tight, and his head was hanging down over his chest. The rope was
                        of the thickness of a little finger and about two metres long.</p>
                    <p>Vivante was a regular visitor to the hotel in which this sad event took
                        place, and on this occasion he only engaged his room on his arrival from
                        Cairo on the 8th, inst. On the afternoon of the 11th inst. he played
                        dominoes at the Bourse Café, as was his custom, and in the evening he took
                        supper with Elia Coneegliano. He was in excellent spirits and told Mr.
                        Conegliano that on the following day he was going to sell some of the shares
                        which he held. Afterwards he went to the hotel with Nacamuli.</p>
                    <p>The deceased was the representative of the Remington Typewriter Company and
                        of the automatic machines placed in the bars, and leaves some £10,000. He
                        was 47 years of age.</p>
                    <p>The question which everybody, including the police, are asking is : was it
                        murder or suicide ?</p>
                    <p>The police as yet have no clue to enable them to take decisive steps, and we
                        can only add that the only information we have been able to gather is that
                        one of his employés, a certain Arunson, is said to have threatened to
                        strangle him. If it is case a murder, it is certain that it was not for
                        theft, as money was found in the deceased's pocket, as well as his gold
                        watch.</p>

                    <p>With reference to the recent disaster to a party of the Camel Corps when l
                        aving Bir Natron post, the "Sudan Times" is officially informed that a Court
                        of Enquiry has recently been held at Dongola to investigate the
                        circumstances connected with the incident. </p>
                    <p>The fact that a Court of Enquiry was held does not imply that there were any
                        particular circumstances connected with the case which demanded an enguiry,

                        or if it was dae to misfortune. </p>
                    <p>The disaster is officially said to be attributable to the following causes

                    <p>The advanced section of the Radical party have been much exercised in their
                        minds regarding the proposed national grant to Lord Cromer in recognition of
                        his magnificent services to Egypt and the Empire, and a meeting was held at
                        the House of Commons on Monday week, presided over by Mr. R. C. Lehmann, to
                        discuss the matter. There was much difference of opinion on the subject of
                        opposing the grant, it being held by some members that a monetary reward to
                        a servant of the State for the discharge of his duty was contrary to public
                        policy; but others urged that an exception should be made in the case of
                        Lord Cromer, in view of his unique record. Ultimately the subject was
                        allowed to drop without any decision being arrived at in respect of
                        concerted action in the Honse.</p>
                    <p>The "Globe" commenting on this meeting remarks :</p>
                    <p>It is satisfactory to note that there has been a divergence of opinion among
                        the antipatriots in the House of Commons, as to the action to be taken with
                        regard to the proposed grant to Lord Cromer. We are quite ready to admit
                        that the several members of Parliament who met together yesterday to discuss
                        the matter are actuated by no personal animosity towards the late
                        Consul-General. What is very appar. rent, however, is that the opportunity
                        is regarded as an excellent one upon which to raise the whole question of
                        Egyptian administration, and, of course, to find fault with the system of
                        government in operation. And herein lies the danger of the situation. Had
                        these political iconoclasts merely conspired to attack Lord Cromer himself,
                        their action would have passed unnoticed. When, however, they range
                        themselves alongside Egyptian agitators, fuel is added to the smouldering
                        elements of disaffection. Not many months ago, as Lord Cromer stated in his
                        annual report, there was cause for considerable un easiness, in official
                        quartiers, as regards natiye unrest. By a firm hand, however, and a proper
                        application of the law, the movement was suppressed, and quiet has reigned
                        over since. The fact' was, those responsible for the agitation discovered
                        that there was no responsive echo in England. Now, however, they will take
                        heart again, and should a debate be raised in Parliament, and those
                        responsible for it indulge in the usual condemnatory language of everything
                        that is Bratish, the Egyptian agitator will recommence his campaign.
                        Fortunately, there are still a few men on the Radical benches who realise
                        and appreciate the advantages of our role in Egypt, as also in other parts
                        of the world. The result of the debate, therefore, will only be to encourage
                        native discontent at the expense of a more rigorous execution of the
                        law..</p>

                    <p>ALEXANDRIA'S CELEBRATION:</p>
                    <p>The celebration of the foundation of La République Française was marred in
                        Alex adria to a great extent on account of their being no official
                        organisation of a fête, but nevertheless yesterday was generally recognised
                        in Alexandria as a day of celebration. The buildings of the main streets
                        were gaily paroisés with bunting, in which the tricolour naturally
                        predominated, but all of the many nations who find homes for their sons in
                        Egypt were well represented. In the evening there was a feeble effort at
                        illumination, but for this we can only give credit to the French Consulate,
                        Cercle Français, Crédit Lyonnais, and Comptoir National d'Escompte. </p>
                    <p>The fête at San Stefano Casino on Saturday evening was a great success. </p>
                    <p>Yesterday evening special, performances were given at the Tour Eiffel and the
                        Eldo rado, and both music-halls were well filled with enthusiastic
                        audiences. At the Tour Eiffel an excellent and varied programine was
                        provided and every turn was received with loud outbursts of applause,
                        especially those of the English performers, whom we are glad to recoga nise
                        as among the best artistes on the stage. Bert Flatt, the humorous American
                        musical comedian scored a huge success, and both Violet Esdaile and the
                        three Sisters Florence were most warmly received, while Annie Grey, who
                        opened the programme to a somewhat thin audience was more heartily applauded
                        than ever. At the conclusion of the performance the Marseillaise was sung by
                        the whole troupe and the enthusiasm of the audience was unbounded. At the
                        first notes of this soul-stirring national hymn the cosmopolitan audience
                        rose to its feet, and, awaiting the chorus, joined in with a hearty good
                        will. At the end of the second verse the strains of "God save the King"
                        evoked a strong combination of voices from the many EngJishmen present, and
                        was sung with a verve which delighted the hearts of those severed from their
                        Motherland, while the shouts of "L'Entente Cordiale" which followed amply
                        exemplified the genuineness of Anglo-French friendship. The last verse of
                        the Marseillaise followed this, and the band then played the Italian
                        national anthem, and the chorns of the Marseillaise was then repeated, the
                        Khedivial national anthem being also given. Needless to say the audience
                        unanimously and vociferously demanded an encore, and this was given, the
                        Marseillaise being repeated without interlude. A similar scene was enacted
                        at the Eldorado, to which extra attraction was given by the illuminated
                        garden, the presence of four bands, and a lavish display of fireworks. </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir.- We residents in the Muallaqa buildAngs, Old Cairo, beg you to
                            devote a space in your daily paper for the following: -</p>
                        <p>Some time ago, the Antiquities Department, in order to discover the door
                            of the Tower of the Old Citadel, called Kasr esh-Shama or ElMuallaqa
                            Fortress, made some diggings close by the buildings neighbouring the
                            Muallaqa. A great pit was thereby created which was filled by
                            infiltration water of a stagnant and offensive nature, as may render the
                            place a source of deadly epidemics during the four seasons. The case
                            having been submitted to the Public Health Department, it was suggested
                            by it that the Antiquities Department which is most interested in the
                            place, should pump out the water, of which it may profit at the same
                            time by using it in watering a plot of ground adjacent to the place,
                            some half an acre in area, and attempting to make a small garden of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion was however allowed to drop and a less expensive plan was
                            recurred to by the Antiquities Department. The plan consisted in
                            throwing a cantar of lime in the pic every month for killing mosquitoes.
                            Advisable as the plan may appear, it has its drawbacks, as it will
                            certainly deface the scenery and make the place less attractive to
                            tourists and visitors, who flock in hundreds every year to visit the
                            place. We, therefore, request you to join us in taking the cause of one
                            of the best ruins in Egypt and enjoin on the Antiquities Department to
                            adopt the plan proposed by the Sanitary Department, to which allusion
                            has been made above.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT. <lb/> MINISTERIAL CHANGES. </head>
                    <p>NATIVE PRESS OPINION. </p>
                    <p>The forthcoming changes in the official world, which it is believed will take
                        place in the autumn are the subject of as much comment in the Native, as in
                        the Emopean Press. "Al Lewa" remarks : </p>
                    <p>The changes expected to take place in the present Government are now the
                        important topic of conversation in every native circle. The position of the
                        Council of Ministers will be vacant, for H.E. Mustapha Pasha Fahmy has
                        resolved to tender his resignation con account of a ngw change of
                        circumstances which does not permit his policy to continue as it is. It is
                        said that H. E. was going to present his resignation before leaving for
                        Europe, but it was decided that this resolution onght to be delayed and that
                        Saad Pasha Zaglool the son-in-law of Moustafa Fahmy Pasha should go to
                        London to have himself nominated for the premiership and to use Lord Cromer
                        as an intercessor for him. But the latest news from England indicates that
                        Saad Pasha's efforts have proved unsuiccessful. The information we have
                        atout the new ministry indicates that two or three Ministers will resign and
                        be replaced by two or three from the bar. We are now in a position to state
                        that the new ministry will be practically responsible for its actions and
                        the advisers will be advisers in the real sense of the word. The anthority
                        of the provincial inspectors will then shrink and not exceed the bounds of
                        simple superin tendence instead of actual interference with the duties of
                        the mudirs who will be enti tled to a wider sphere of authority. The
                        jurisdiction of the Provincial institutions will he extended. When these
                        changes take place they will doubtless reyolutionise the present system of
                        Government to the advantage of the Egyptians. </p>
                    <p>A Coptic vernacular newspaper of Cairo comments as follows on the rumours of
                        the impending changes : </p>
                    <p>Great hopes are now evidently entertained by the Opposition party on the
                        subject of the Egyptian Ministry. Theseindefatigableagitatora are under the
                        impression that Sir Eldon Gorst carries in his pocket to England elaborate
                        plans for a complete change in the presen order of things with the formation
                        of a ney Ministry at the top of the list. Of course, the wish is in this
                        case father to the thought, fo our Nationalists have always expressed a
                        desire to see the present Administration overthrow and have been hammering
                        on this copic fo over a decade. Their bête noire is the venerabl gentleman
                        who has acted as Prime Minister i Egypt so long and is expected to relinqois
                        the reins of office from day to day, owing to th delicate condition of his
                        health. The enemie of our honest and cultured Premier seem t think that once
                        he is out of the way the whol Government of Egypt will be remodelled on
                        different plan and every object of the Nation alist agitators will be
                        attained. The other Ministers are equally obnoxious to sedition mongers;
                        their fall will be an additional pleasure no doubt. But if they happen to
                        remain unde a new Premier selected from the other camp the triump of
                        sedition will be considered complete for some time. </p>
                    <p>No doubt Moustafa Pasha Fahmy will retir one day and the present Ministry
                        will b changed. But we assure our shrieking oppo nents that no Minister
                        under the presen regime will find it possible or expedient t deviate from
                        the course of the present Admin istration, ard that the will of the rulin
                        Power "shall prevail" as long as its rule lasts.</p>

                                proposal regarding a declaration of war. The reservations made by
                                Great Britain, United States. and Japan have been withdrawn and the
                                Dutch amendment rejected. Other amendments providing for a state of

                                necessity of defining war, as war was sometimes made on China under

                    <p>Sir Charles Elirt, alike by his long and waried diplomatic experience and his
                        administration in East Africa, is a highly qualified Fudge of unfamiliar
                        civilisations. Among the numerous works that have been devoted of recent
                        years to the problems of the Far East, his unpretentious little book takes a
                        very high place, and the reader of his letters will learn more from them
                        than from nine-tenths of the more elaborate volumes on Japan and China which
                        have been published of recent years. These letters were written in the
                        summer and autumn of 1906, during a tour through Japan and the coast
                        provinces of China "The main object of my journey," Sir Charles Eliot tells
                        ns, "was to obtain some practical knowledge of the languages and creeds of
                        the Far East, and, in particular, to study the curious development which
                        Buddhism has undergone in those counEries." The result of these special
                        investigations may be published at a later date. In the meantime, we have
                        the advantage of looking on the much-discussed Far East through the eyes of
                        a very shrewd, impartial, and catholicminded observer. </p>
                    <p>The most important truth which emerges from these pages is the fact which
                        struck Sir Charles Eliot most forcibly during his trayels, _"the
                        distinctness of China and Japan from the rest of Asia, and particularly from
                        the Indian and Mohammedan East." We are too much inclined to speak of </p>
                    <p>"Asiatics" or "Orientals" in the same broad sense as that in which we speak
                        of"Europeans," and so to ignore the fundamental distinctions between the
                        East and West of Asia. Yet there is at least as much difference between a
                        Hindu and a Japanese as there is between a Frenchman and an Arab, and to
                        forget this fact is to be led upon a fatally erroneous path of argument. In
                        his very able introduction, summing up the main features of his experience
                        in the Far East, Sir Charles Eliot suggests that the civilisations of the
                        world as now existing may be divided into four main types,-European
                        (including the white races all over the earth), Mohammedan, Hindu, and
                        Chinese. This is a far more rational division than the commoner one into
                        European and Asiatic. The civilisation of the white races has the central
                        fact of Christianity in common, and enjoys joint ownership of the great
                        mechanical discoveries which have done so much in the last century to modify
                        the facts of human life. Christianity, as Sir Charles Eliot reminds us, for
                        all its Asiatic origin, must be regarded as an essentially European
                        religion, for it has taken hold on humanity nowhere outside the confines of
                        the white races. Our author doubts how far it is responsible for the
                        material, scientific, and moral progress of Europe, point ing out that this
                        has been least striking where the clergy have most power, as in Spain and
                        Russia. Perhaps he has here failed to distinguish between Christianity and
                        the Church, which are not at all the same thing. But the general unity of
                        white civilisation is unquestionable. The civilisations of Westen | Asia, as
                        far as the Chinese frontiers, are less questionably the outcome of the
                        dominant religions, Mohammedanism and Hinduism. Neither of them is likely to
                        have any extended future before it. Islam, though essentially proselytising,
                        has been restrained within well-marked limits owing to our recognition of
                        its dangers, as illustrated by the long struggle of Eastern Europe against
                        the Turk and by the recent fight to save Egypt from Mahdism. Hinduism is not
                        aggressive, and is practically confined to India. When we come to the
                        Chinese sphere, includJing Japan, we are confronted with a new set of
                        conditions, much more closely recalling those of Europe. Religion here has
                        less to do with the dominant type of civilisation than in any other part of
                        the world. "The basis of Chinese institutions is an excellent, sane,
                        prosaic, moral philosophy," which can hardly be called a religion at all.
                        Japan has nothing that can | be called a national religion, in the sense we
                        which we speak of Britain as a Christian country. China and Japan are
                        neither fanatical nor aggressive by natural tendency, though the trend of
                        recent events has taught the leaders of both countries that their old policy
                        of dignified conservatism and splendid isolation can only be preserved by
                        force of arms. Japan recognised this fundamental truth in the last
                        generation, and the thoroughness with which she has adapted herself to the
                        new conditions is one of the most surprising facts in the history of the
                        world. China is gradnally awakening to it, and the history of the next
                        half-century in the Far East will probably be dominated by this recognition,
                        in which Japan is likely to take a very important share. Si Charles Eliot
                        has thus been led to the conclu sion-shared by most competent publiciststhat
                        the Chinese and Japanese are destined to become one of the dominant Powers
                        in the Pacific, and to be brought into acute rivalry with the other great
                        world civilisation--the aggressive, esurient, and haughty civilisation of
                        Europe. This probability is what the German Emperor and many other statesmen
                        agree to name as the "yellow peril," against which it is often asserted that
                        a league of Christendom must be formed It is worth while to quote the
                        impressive passages in which Sir Charles Eliot gives the reasons for his
                        refusal to join in thi outcry, since it is the keynote and the con clusion
                        of his researches :</p>
                    <p>"I would not call this the Yellow Peril, for do not myself feel the danger.
                        European civilisation is not, to my mind, so perfect tha any alteration or
                        amalgamation with othe schemes of life would degrade it, or tha humanity
                        would be a loser if it does not be come paramount in all parts of the globe.

                            Arnold. [8s, 6d, net.] </note>
                        <cb n="4"/> one possesses the necessary impartiality and cosmopolitan
                        outlook to be able to decide whether the Asiatic or the European character
                        is, as a whole, the better. It is, however, just to say that the greatest
                        achievements of Europeans in art and literature are superior to the greatest
                        achievements of Asiatics in the same spheres ; but, then, these achievements
                        are far from being a general characteristic of Europeans. The productive
                        periods are few, widely. scattered in time, and confined to few countries.
                        On the other hand, the evils and ugliness of modern European civilisation
                        are as obvious as its disadvantages, and there is no clearer proof of them
                        than the fascination which the East exercises upon nearly all who come under
                        its spell. The extension of European influence does not mean the
                        distribution over other continents of the beauty and genius of Europe, but
                        merely of the most commonplace aspects of European life and industry. To
                        those who are occupied with the task of organising new cities and states
                        colonial life may seem the most interesting in the world-and I have felt the
                        passion myself in East Africa---but for those who do not share in this
                        creative joy, and look simply at the results, it must be confessed that
                        America, particularly Western America, and the British colonies have added
                        very little to the art, literature, interest, variety and pleasure of
                        humanity ; nor do I see why it should be considered a calamity if European
                        influence does not become everywhere predominant or even has to recede in
                        certain spheres. Variety must be for the intellectual and pictorial
                        advantage of mankind as long as the various types are not destructive or
                        evil in themselves. I should be sorry to see the strength and extent of
                        Mohamedanism increased, for it is an intolerant and destructive religion,
                        which with difficulty frees itself from such evils as slavery. Yet much will
                        be lost to the worldnay, is being lost-with the gradual disappearance of
                        Mohamedan states. But Far Easter, and specially Japanese, civilisation can
                        be reproached with no particular evil, and it brings with it a
                        picturesqueness, cheerfulness, and courtesy which must be recognised as good
                        elements. Its fault is not aggressiveness, but rather a too great
                        willingness to learn, which makes it ready to abandon its own good points."

                        from the hinterland of Accra of a native woman and six children, all born at
                        a birth. The fact is, we believe, authentically established, and must be, we
                        should imagine, without, a parallel. Un former times, such an event would
                        have been deemed a portent of the most terrible kind, presaging war, famine,
                        and pestilence, but we daresay that even on the Gold Coast it will at this
                        time of day be received with comparative equanimity.</p>

                    <p>CRICKET. RAILWAY INSTITUTE</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">versus 3RD COLDSTREAM GUARDS. The second meeting of these
                            clubs took place at Guezireh Badrane last Friday. The Institute were
                            unable to place a full team into the field but the coldstreams were at
                            full strength. The Guards skipper having won the toss sent in Sergts.
                            Smith and Sohrstadt but the former was out 1.b.w. second ball. Major the
                            Earl of Lanesborough the next man was missed off the two first talls he
                            received. He only scored five, however, before being taken nicely in the
                            long field by Wilson. On Private Revell joining Mohrstadt runs came
                            fairly fast, Revell inaking some splendid "carpet" drives. When 20
                            Mohrstadt was clean bowled by Revd. Burns, Lieut. Tollemache who
                            jollowed was also bowled by Revd. Burns for the unenviable "duck." White
                            kept in while Revell scored a few but was finally caught brilliantly by
                            Windsor, Capt. Lane and Lieut. Burton the two next men were both bowled
                            by Revd. Barns for "ducks." Revell was the next man to go after a
                            splendid innings of 32. His dismissal was a curious one. He played
                            forward to a fast ball from Wilson and a confident appeal was inade for
                            a catch at the wicket which the umpire refused. The batsman under the
                            impression that he had struck the ball and not hearing the umpire's
                            decision commenced to retire but was told to go back, but before he
                            could return to his crease Davies had whipped the bails off. None of the
                            other batsman did much and the innings closed for 74.P.G. Windsor and
                            Revd. Burus opened the Institute innings and so brilliantly did both men
                            play that the Guards total was passed before both were out. Windsor who
                            made 42 made some magnificent strokes, one huge drive going right out of
                            the ground. He made some splendid cuts and he deserved the ovation he
                            received on coming in. Rev. Burns who made 26 batted very well indeed.
                            Wilson subsequently batted well for 20 and on the fall of the eighth
                            wicket stumps were drawn, the Institute reversing the result of the
                            previous match. Rev. Burns deserves special praise for his bowling. He
                            made a record by capturing 9 wickets for 36 runs. Appended are the
                            scores :</hi>

                    <p>IN WEIGHT SINCE USING DOAN'S</p>
                    <p>BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS.</p>
                    <p>21, Moore's Lane, Standish, near Wigan, England. Your Doan's Backache Kidney
                        Pills have been worth their weight in gold to me. Before using them I had
                        long been a sufferer with kidney complaint. The slightest cold or chill told
                        on my kidneys, rendering their action irregular and unnatural. The
                        secretions were thick, and contained a white, chalky sediment after
                        standing. At times the water was scarce, and painful in passing ;
                        frequently, too, I have been compelled to leave my bed several times during
                        the night.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes on rising in the mornings I scar cely dared to draw my breath,
                        because of the awful stabbing pain in the back. I got reduced to a very low
                        state, and though I tried many medicines, nothing relieved me except you
                        pills. </p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>I am sure you will share my joy when I tell you that I have been splendidly
                        cured by Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. I get up in the nornings now withont
                        feeling the slightest pain in my back; and I have gained 17 lbs. ir weight.
                        I owe my splendid cure to Doan's Pills, and I shall be only too glad to
                        recom mend them. </p>
                    <p>- Believe me, yours faithfully, </p>
                    <p>(signed) J. DANIELS. Some months later our representative hac the pleasure of
                        seeing Mr. Daniels, who declar ed himself to be still enjoying good health
                        and freedom from kidney complaint. </p>
