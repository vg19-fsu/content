                    <head>PROFESSOR PETRIE'S BOOK.</head>
                    <p>"I was reading the other day a remarkably interesting account of Professor
                        Flinders Petrie's researches in the Sinai region," writes Mr. J. Ramsay
                        Macdonald in the "Labour Leader." "It was a triumph of patient seeking after
                        evidence, of patient piecing it together, of patient reading of its enfolded
                        meaning. I felt for the time how much better are the deserts of Sinai than
                        the green benches of the House of Commons, how much richer is the harvest
                        one reaps from the effort spent in the one than in the other, how much more
                        pleasure one gets from scientific work than from political worry, and how
                        much happier is the scientist that the politician. Amidst the altars of
                        Sinai the petty has been hushed by the soothing best of many centuries, and
                        only the worthy and the venerated arise at the resurrecting call of the
                        explorer. </p>
                    <p>"After that I saw that this explorer of Egyptian temples and Arabian
                        settlerrients had written a book on politics, and I got it to see what a
                        scientific mind had to say on the fights of modern men and the turmoil of
                        living cities. But no pleasure awaited me in 'Janusin Modern Life'
                        (Constable: 2s. 6d. net). A scientific man in the market place is apt to be
                        a Jeremiah and is prone to be the most unscientific of persons. </p>
                    <p>"Professor Petrie's excursion in politics is not worth discussing in detail,
                        but it has set me thinking why advanced political thought gets so little
                        support from the scientific professions nowadays in this country. Once upon
                        a time the learned professions were Liberal almost to a man ; now they are
                        Conservative. Elsewhere, even when they are opposed, their critical
                        contributions to political thought are valuable ; in this country few of
                        their political pronouncements are worth reading. </p>
                    <p>"One of the reasons is that in this country there is no scientific class. It
                        is mixed up with and patronised by other classes. Its successful men enter
                        society, and abandon that intellectual simplicity which a simple-minded
                        devotion to science demands. </p>
                    <p>"The catholicity of English society is its most portentons characteristic.
                        This thing which has grown up through the centuries, which has a blinding
                        dazzle, fabulous wealth, smiling attractions—which is too wise not to be
                        sensuous, and too much alive not to be exhilarating—is like a Upas tree,
                        under whose shadow no rival plant will grow. Faraday was the last of the
                        pure class of scientists. Since then society has seen that it most win the
                        homage of intelligence by playing down to the weakness of intelligence.
                        Moreover, English science has been in the main individualistic. The
                        competitive side of Darwinism has been exaggerated until its co-operative
                        side has been lost sight of. </p>
                    <p>"Professor Petrie, lamenting about the sloth of the day, tells how it is to
                        be found in all classes, and yet be puts it down to individual shortcomings.
                        Surely a scientific eye would have seen that this widespread disease
                        requireed some social cause. Or, again, when Professor Petrie refers to the
                        great effect of mechanical appliances upon character, a scientific instinct
                        would have seen at once that that was an important fact, establishing some
                        organic relationship between the individual and his society which made crude
                        individualism an untenable creed. One day the significance of these things
                        will not. be missed, and it will a then be as impossible for a scientific
                        man to write `Janus in Modern Life' and think of his individual apart from
                        his society as it will be for him to be satisfied with the proots that the
                        earth is flat." </p>

                        <p>A very amusing story is reported by the "Depêche Coloniale." Two torpedo
                            boats are kept at Harve under the charge of a non-commissioned officer.
                            The Vice-Admiral commanding the first naval district has just heard with
                            amazement that for a month past an individual, giving himself out as a
                            naval officer, has "taken command" of the Havre torpedo craft, making
                            the crews man the boats, dress the ship, and perform exercises almost
                            daily. He borrowed thǝ tunic of the non-commissioned officer in charge,
                            and tacked on epaulettes to suit the 'rank he had given himself, of
                            captain. A few days ago he disappeared, but in order, presumably, to
                            leave a good impression behind, he cancelled all punishment he had
                            inflicted. He is now being busily searched for. Whether his proceedings
                            are those of a practical joker, lunatic, or spy seems uncertain. </p>

                            morning and the company separated with many pleasant memories of a
                            charming fete. The music provided by the Society band, under the able
                            direction of Maestro Cav. U. Pucciarelli was executed with considerable
                            skill on the terrace, which was brilliantly illuminated by electricity.

                    <head>THE "OLIVEMOOR."<lb/>CREW LEAVES THE SHIP.</head>
                    <p>ARRIVAL OF SALVAGE STEAMER.</p>
                    <p>As reported in our issue of Saturday the position of the ,"Olivemoor" had
                        become so dangerous that a tug had been sent out to her to stand by to fetch
                        the crew ashore in the event of it being impossible for them to remain
                        aboard the stranded vessel. The tug arrived shortly after we had gone to
                        press and the same afternoon the crew left the boat. Behind the Porta and
                        Lights tug were towed two of the "Olivermoor's" boats, but so rough was the
                        sea that shortly after leaving Agami one of them broke away and was lost. </p>
                    <p>Thenceforth the boat was all but a derelict. Deserted compulsorily by her
                        crew, it was only by the captain standing by in a tug, that she could not be
                        lawfully claimed in ownership by the first who could step aboard her. The
                        shore is crowded by a hoarde of Bedouins, anxiously waiting for the ship to
                        break up that they may seize upon the wreckage. Driven hither and thither by
                        the coastguards, these wild sons of the desert retire to return in stronger
                        force, and should their avidity be increased by the sight of wreckage which
                        might become their booty it would be quite impossible for the small force of
                        coastguards to hold them back. Resistance would undoubtedly result in a
                        fierce fight between coastguards and Bedouins, and report says that of the
                        latter there are some two thousand. It is well-known to all that to the
                        Bedouins of the coast the possibility of securing booty is the strongest
                        incentive to fighting that one could offer them, and nought would they care
                        did a few of them fall in the attempt to obtain it. </p>
                    <p>As for the vessel, her position becomes worse almost every hour, and on
                        Saturday night she turned right round, her bow now pointing seaward.
                        Needless to say the hole in her bottom is becoming larger and larger, and
                        there is no doubt that she is on the pinnacle of a rock, which acts as a
                        pivot to aid her in her circular movements. The water, which up to Saturday
                        was confined to holds 1 and 2, is now filling her engine-rooms, and the "
                        Berger Wilhelm " will have a hard fight to save her from becoming a total
                        wreck. </p>
                    <p>At this point we would like to pay a just tribute to the manner in which the
                        captain, officers, and crew have conducted their work since they were placed
                        in their unfortunate position. Stranded for a week in a most dangerous
                        position, with a jagged rock penetrating the bottom of the boat, hoping
                        against hope for the sight of a salvage vessel to save a newly-built ship,
                        baulked by unpropitious winds and rough seas, pitched from side to side,
                        with the bolts and rivets threatening to give way with every movement of the
                        vessel, these men have performed what little lay in their power with stout
                        heart, and with the true stamina of the world-famed British sailor. Their's
                        has been a hard task, for they recognised that they were working against the
                        heaviest odds, while the hearts of the crew, who were working for their
                        families at home, must have been sad at the thought that should they have to
                        leave the ship, discharge was awaiting them ashore. But such is the law of
                        shipping, and such is the condition under which they signed. We can but
                        express the hope that other billets will speedily come their way. Meanwhile
                        they will be housed and boarded at the Seamen's Home, and at the first
                        opportunity will be offered passages to England. </p>
                    <p>At half past eight this morning we received a message to say that the salvage
                        steamer "Berger Wilhelm" was entering the pass in order to go through the
                        necessary formalities, such as taking practique, and to take in coal, on
                        completion of which she would proceed direct to the "Olivemoor" and commence
                        salving operations. The sea continues rough and the wind is blowing as
                        strongly as ever.</p>
                    <p>The situation, disastrous as it is, has not been without its glimpse of
                        humour. This morning a gentleman to whom had been consigned two trunks of
                        patterns for suitings etc., called at the agency of the company to impress
                        upon them the urgency of saving his consignment, even if nothing else could
                        be salved. He suggested sending out a special tug to attempt their rescue,
                        for they were worth, he said, £5,000. The impractibility of his suggestion
                        was pointed out to him and he was told that in all probability they had been
                        spoilt by the water, which floods the vessel. "Impossible," he cried, "I've
                        got the key in my pocket !" </p>
                    <p>Later. </p>
                    <p>Most unsatisfactory reports on the situation of the "Olivemoor" continue to
                        reach us and. just as we are going to press a message comes to hand that the
                        vessel is practically "done for". So strong is the wind and so rough the sea
                        that we understand there is little chance of the "Berger Wilhelm" being able
                        to start operations before tomorrow morning. </p>
                    <p>Latest News. </p>
                    <p>The Captain of the "Berger Wilhelm" is going to make an effort to reach the
                        "Olivemoor" this afternoon and, if possible, will commence operation&amp;
                        The vessel is now quite full of water. </p>

                    <p>WORK DONE IN 1906</p>
                    <p>We have just received a report from Captain H. G. Lyons, D.Sc., F.R.S., on
                        the work of the Survey Department in 1906. The two principal features of the
                        work were the completion of the cadastral survey and the publication of
                        about one-quarter of the general map of the Nile Valley and the Delta on the
                        scale of 1:50,000. In this report some statistics are given of the cadastral
                        survey, but it is proposed to treat this more fully in a special report. The
                        organisation of the Department remains as it was last year, viz. :—(1)
                        Headquarters : comprising— (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Central Office. (<hi
                            rend="italic">b</hi>) Computation Office. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Map

                        Precise Survey. (3) Topographical Survey. (4) Cadastral Survey. (5)
                        Geological Survey. </p>
                    <p>In the central office are included not only the administrative staff of the
                        department, but also certain important sections which are engaged in
                        branches of work necessary for the completion of the different classes of
                        surveying, as well as the lines of investigation to which these give rise.
                        These sections are :— </p>
                    <p>(1) The Computation Office, in which the mathematical control and discussion
                        of the observations made in the course of surveying operations are carried
                        out, as well as all calculations required for the accurate drawing and
                        reproduction of maps. The superintendence of the meteorological stations and
                        the preparation of the observations taken at them for publication also fall
                        to the charge of this section. </p>
                    <p>(2) The reproduction office, in which all maps and plans are prepared, as
                        well as diagrams and other similar work for the illustration of reports and
                        publications. </p>
                    <p>(3) The laboratory, where rocks, ores, and minerals of the geological survey
                        are examined, the gas supply of Cairo is photometrically controlled,
                        materials such as paints, oils, lime, cement, asphalt, etc., are analysed to
                        see that they are in conformity with specification, the water-supply of
                        Cairo, is analysed weekly, as well as the river water and the silt which the
                        Nile carries in suspension during a large portion of the year. The precise
                        survey is entrusted with the first order ( geodetic ) and second order
                        triangulation, the precise levelling, and the charge of the meteorological
                        observatory at Helwan.</p>
                    <p>The topographical survey executes the third and fourth order triangulation,
                        the preparation of topographical maps on 1:10,000 and smaller scales, the

                        and the land registers which accompany them, together with all corrections

                    <p>A considerable amount of information, of both scientific and technical value,
                        is constantly being accumulated in the Survey Department, although in many
                        cases the investigation on any one subject does not go far enough to furnish
                        material for a full report on it. In order that such information may be
                        rendered available, the Ministry of Finance has authorised the publication
                        from time to time of "Survey Department Papers" in which work of technical
                        or scientific value will be presented. Each paper will deal with a single
                        piece of work in as complete a form as the material available will admit,
                        and every effort will be made to include a full account of all earlier work
                        on the subject which may have been done in this country. It is hoped that in
                        this way pieces of research may be rendered available to other scientific
                        workers without the necesity for the long delay often caused by waiting
                        until an exhaustive treatise can be prepared. This will also allow the
                        annual report on the work of the department to be restricted to a teport of
                        progress only, and will avoid the inclusion in it of the results of research
                        work which may thereby he difficult of access.</p>

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN INDUSTRIAL </head>
                    <p>Since the crisis in Egyptian finance a few months ago as a result of the
                        over-speculation in land we have not heard a great deal of Egyptian
                        enterprises, although there are many progressive industrial undertakings
                        well worthy of the attention of the investor. Now that matters have settled
                        down quietly again one is disposed to look round for shares of a sound
                        nature that have been unduly depressed by the temporary financial stress in
                        the country. In this connection we may direct attention to the company well
                        known here, and even better throughout the land of the Pharaohs, as Egyptian
                        Markets, Limited. This concern, which has been established some nine or ten
                        years, is not interested in land, as most of the enterprises promoted in
                        this country are, but owes its origin to a concession granted by the
                        Egyptian Government for the construction and management of official markets
                        throughout both Upper and Lower Egypt. The concession being a Government
                        grant constitutes what practically amounts to a monopoly so far as the
                        specified localities are concerned, so that the company has nothing to fear
                        in the way of competition. The idea of the Government in granting this
                        concession was to endeavour to stamp out cattle diseases, which at one time
                        were of a very serious nature in Egypt. At first the company had very many
                        difficulties to contend with in this respect, but as time went on these
                        difficulties gradually grew less, until the company has become, through
                        sound and methodical principles, so successful in stamping out disease that
                        the Egyptian Government have extended the period of the company's original
                        grant by some fifteen years, The capital is, roughly, £174,700 in £1 shares,
                        the whole of which is insured for repayment by a series of policies
                        maintained annually out of revenue, so that shareholders will receive back
                        in full their original capital whenever the properties revert to the
                        Government. It is here interesting to see the gross receipts and dividends
                        paid for each of the past three years :—</p>

                    <p>It should be pointed out that in 1903 there was a serious outbreak of cattle
                        plague, so that both in that year and the following year no dividends were
                        paid, although in the latter year a dividend was earned. as will be readily
                        seen from the above figures. We have already said that this cattle-plague
                        difficulty is gradually being wiped out, so that fear in this respect need
                        now be only of a minor character, as the company is in a position to very
                        effectively check outbreaks in fact, so successfully is this now done that
                        the directors take very little notice of an outbreak. As an instance of the
                        progress made .during the current year by the company, it may be noted that
                        the gross revenue to date amounts to £25,892, and compares with £21,809 for
                        the same period last year, thus showing an increase of some £3,583. This
                        rate of advance is satisfactory, to say the least, especially as it is
                        derived from the markets alone, and likely to be very materially increased
                        when other sources of enterprise which the company has in hand commence to
                        operate. Amongst these the company has undertaken—and lately made an issue
                        of 50,000 new shares at 27s. 6d. per share for that purpose—the sale and
                        distribution of nitrates in Egypt, for which with their 120 market centres
                        they have unrivalled facilities. Apart from this, arrangements have just
                        been completed with the two concerns in Egypt who practically between them
                        own the salt monopoly for the Egyptian Markets to act as sole distributing
                        agents for salt. It is thought that these latter arrangements are likely to
                        have an enormous influence upon the company's earnings at an early date,
                        especially in connection with the nitrate, for which there is an
                        exceptionally keen demand throughout the whole of the country for
                        agricultural purposes. People well informed as to the conditions prevailing
                        are confident that the dividends will steadily advance to an ultimate goal
                        of 20 per cent. at least, and, considering the prospects, the shares appear
                        a cheap investment at the current price of about 29s., at which figure they
                        are apparently being quietly absorbed by shrewd market individuals.</p>

                    <p>By the retirement of Colonel James Magill, M.D., C.B., the Royal Army Medical
                        Corps will be deprived of the services of a most capable officer, whose good
                        work in Egypt and the Transvaal has been highly appreciated. Colonel Magill,
                        who was appointed a surgeon in 1876, was for many years associated with the
                        Coldstream Guards, and was present with the camel corps throughout the
                        Soudan campaign of 1884-85, during which he was severely wounded at the
                        battle of Abu Klea, receiving for his services mention in despatches, the
                        medal with two clasps, and the Khedive's Star. As Principal Medical Officer
                        to a division, he saw most of the important engagements of the recent South
                        African war, including the battles of Belmont, Enslin, Modder River,
                        Magersfontein, and the subsequent operations in Cape Colony, again obtaining
                        mention in despatches, two medals with no fewer than eight clasps, and the
                        Companionship of the Bath. In 1904 he was gazetted to the rank of
                        Surgeon-Colonel, and in the following year became Principal Medical Office
                        in Egypt.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN 1907</head>
                    <p>In reviewing the cotton movements during the past season, the "Manchester
                        Guardian" states : Egyptian cotton has ruled high during the season, with
                        some violent fluctuations. The lowest price of the season occurred very
                        early. Fully good fair on the spot at Liverpool was at 9 15-16d. on
                        September 1 and at 9 1/2d. on Ootober 4, but March contracts were lowest on
                        September 1, and so was Alexandria. The highest point touched was on March
                        4—viz, 11 5/8d. on the spot at Liverpool, with July con-tracts at 11 38-64.
                        and Alexandria at 24.10. From those prices values fell to 10 1/16d. for
                        Liverpool spot on April 25 and to 18.9 for November in Alexandria. The crop
                        has proved the largest on record, and so has the consumption. The deficiency
                        of high grade long-stapled American has assisted the demand for Egyptian.
                        Financial depression in Alexandria has of late affected the market, and the
                        hoarding of gold up country by the fellaheen cultivators has, it is said,
                        contributed to the difficulties. Guesses as to the size of the coming crop
                        run from 7,250,000 to 7,500,000 cantars.</p>
                    <p>The season closes with a visible supply of 1,302,110 bales of American
                        cotton, against 864,530 a year ago. The stock of American at Liverpool is
                        658,760 bales, against 298,220. The total visible supply of American for
                        Great Britain is 666,760 bales, against 333,220 in 1906. The current price
                        of middling American is 7.46., against 5.41d. in 1906. </p>

                        Bank of Athens, to Miss Cleopatra Marcopoulo at Mr. Zouro's, uncle of the
                        bride, residence. The ceremony was conducted by Mgr. Theophanos. A large
                        number of friends of both bride and bridegroom were present and many
                        beautiful presents were displayed. The guests were most hospitably
                        entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Zouro and Mr. John Joannides, manager of the
                        Bank of Athens, who acted as best man. After the ceremony a merry evening
                        was spent by the party and the evening ended with a most enjoyable dance,
                        which lasted until after midnight. The happy couple are spending their
                        honeymoon at the New Victoria Hotel, Ramleh.</p>

                    <p>"The promotion of this enterprise," it is added, "testifies to Abdul Hamid's
                        great political far-sightedness, since the line which starts from Damascus
                        binds the Hejaaz region and with it the holy places of Islam, Mecca, and
                        Medina more closely to the rest of the Turkish Empire, and firmly attaches
                        the stream of Musulman pilgrims to the Turkish railway which is now being
                        constructed in the track of the old pilgrim highway. Under Abdul Hamid's
                        rule the authority of the Sultan, as compared with former days, has already
                        grown appreciably in those regions which are so important for Islam, and the
                        inevitable result of the construction of the railway will he still further
                        to strengthen his position." </p>

                    <p>Mr. Edward E. Lang, in the "Contemporary Review," discusses "The All-India
                        Moslem League," and points ont its vital differenee from the Indian Congress
                        movement. The intentions of these Moslem reformers are, the writer
                        maintains, such as should commend them to English sympathies. </p>
                    <p>No Britisher need have cause to fear the formation of the All-India Moslem
                        League. Its object is to help the Government of India in the administration
                        of that country, not to hinder it. It has nothing whatever to do with
                        Pan-Islamism, although persons are sure to come forward who will discover
                        all kinds of alarming evidence, manufactured to suit their own purpose, to
                        prove that the Sultan of Turkey and the Khedive of Egypt have been the prime
                        movers in the formation of the League, which the former intends to use to
                        make thoroughly sound his power as Khalifa. Its birth signifies that
                        Mahomedans now claim that right to which every free-born man is entitled of
                        combining with his fellows to protect his interests, and its watchword is

                    <head>ESSOR ECONOMIQUE DE L'EGYPTE</head>
                    <head>L'OPINION EN EUROPE</head>
                    <p>Deuz traits caractérisent la situation économique de l'Egypte contemporaine :
                        la plus value des importations, supérieure à la plus value des exportations,
                        et une plus value du rendement des impôts déterminant une réduction des
                        tarifs douaniers. En dernière analyse, en remontant aux causes premières, on
                        observera que ces deux faits procèdent d'un fait primordial, initial, la
                        capacité d'achat. </p>
                    <p>Cette eapacité d'achat, ou puissance d'changabilité, réside dans la culture
                        coton-nière, non pas exclusivement, mais principa-lement. Vers cette
                        culture, l'Egypte a tendu tous ses efforts ; à cétte culture, elle doit pour
                        a la majeure part sa prospérité ; sur cette cul-ture repose la garantie de
                        son avenir.</p>
                    <p>Un évènement historique lui révéla sa fonc-tion économique dans la
                        concurrence des na-tions industrielles : la guerre de sécession arreta,
                        momentanément il est vrai, la culture cotonnière dans la vallée du
                        Mississipi. L'E-gypte voulut donneraux usines de Manchester la matière
                        première dont les Etats-Unis ne pouvaient plus les approvisionner. De là
                        date l'essor de ce pays rajeuni, rappelé à une vie nouvelle. Le coton
                        conquis le premier rang parmi les articles d'exportation : sur un total de
                        520 millions, il figure pour 410 millions de francs, soit environ 80 %.
                        Cette proportion suffit à démontrer que c'est la culture coton-nière et
                        l'approvisionnement en cette précieuse matière textile qui ont constitué à
                        l'Egypte par un monopole naturel sa puissance d'a-chat.</p>
                    <p>L'histoire de cette culture serait même inté-ressante à étudier dans ses
                        rapports avec l'his-toire politique de l'Egypte. La nécessité pour la
                        Grande-Bretagne manufacturière et tribu-taire des Etats-Unis de se créer
                        dans une zone plus rapprochée d'elle un marché de matière première
                        n'expliquerait-elle pas sa diplomatie en Egypte? La première nation de
                        l'Europe pour la fabrication des cotonnades n'avait-elle pas un intérêt
                        puissant à se placer la première sur cette terre nilienne? Sur 417 millions
                        de coton que l'Egypte vend an total, la part de l'Angleterre est de 208
                        millions de francs; 50% ; celle de la France de 36 millions ; celle de
                        l'Al-lemagne 35 ; celle des Etats-Unis 31 ; celle de la Suisse, de
                        l'Autriche, respectivement, d'en-viron 20 millions. Cette nécessité
                        n'a-t-elle pas été plus impérieuse du jour où les Etats-Unis ont essayé de
                        se réserver la production du coton ; du jour où ils ont même tenté
                        d'acca-parer les stocks sur les divers marchés du monde ? Ce fut pour
                        l'Egypte, qui vit les prix bondir, une oceasion, une ère de fructueuses
                        opérations. Ce fut pour la Grande-Bretagne inquiète, menacée, un
                        avertissement, un stimu-lant pour sa politique de pénétration et
                        d'ex-ploitation. Voilà pourquoi elle s'est empressée de mettre le Soudan en
                        valeur, le transformant en un vaste domaine deculture cotonnière pour un
                        prochain avenir. Voilà pourquoi elle s'est empressée d'aménager les eaux da
                        fleuve ; de là sa vigilance sur les sources, son ingéniosité dans les
                        travaux d'irrigation : elle a réussi à assujettir le Nil à sa domination
                        économique. La culture cotonnière est garantie, assurée contre le climat par
                        une savante et prudente hydraulique.</p>
                    <p>Le coton est devennu le régulateur de la vie en Epypte ; ce n'est pas la
                        senle culture ; ce serait un erreur de ne point noter la canne à suere, et
                        les autres cultures ; c'est la première, c'est. la directrice des énergies,
                        des initiatives; c'est la source du bien-étre. Ces faits se sont accusés
                        dans un relief plus net depuis quelques années, par une coïncidence curiense
                        avec la tactique américaine. La valeur de la terre a augmenté du simple au
                        double et même an triple : une plus value analogue est à remarquer sur les
                        immeublés dans les villes. De nombren-ses et importantes sociétés
                        immobilières se sont constituées ; 23 en ces trois dernières années ; sur
                        420 millions de capitaux apportés à environ 106 sociétés industrielles,
                        commerciales ou im-mobilières, la proportion te ces dernières est d'environ
                        49 %. On a même craint une spécu-lation et prévu une crise.</p>
                    <p>Aujourd'hui, la condition du fellah s'amé-liore : il remplace la case en
                        terre battue par une maisonnette en briques ; le luxe pare les villes,
                        étendant sa coquetterie jusqu'aux villes de l'intérieur ; le tourisme
                        d'ailleurs apporte de l'argent. Bref, la population s'enrichit et les impôts
                        rendent.</p>
                    <p>A ce moment de l'histoire économique de l'Egypte se place un fait des plus
                        dignes d'at-tention pour l'économiste, qui ne peut négliger d'observer la
                        logique sùre, infaillible des événe-ments. Confiante dans la plus value des
                        rende-ments des impôts, l'Egypte a réduit les tarifs douaniers, ce qui
                        montre que le protection-nisme, s'il a des préoccupations fiscales, devrait
                        finir avec elles: les tarifs ont été réduits de 8 à 4% ; certains articles
                        entrent même en fran-chise, ce sont la houille, les minerais, les bois, ete.
                        Ici encore reparait un trait de la politique anglaise : sur 22 millions de
                        charbon que l'Egypte achète, elle en paye 21 millions è la Grande-Bretagne.
                        L'Egypte enrichie par l'agri-culture s'offre comme un débouché pour les
                        produits manufacturés: c'est un débouché a large espace, de long avenir,
                        solide. De par la constitution du sol, il n'est pas à prévoir que la terre
                        des Pharaons, agricole par ses éléments géologiques et par ses éléments
                        ethniques, donne jainais naissance a l'industrie.</p>
                    <p>Dans ces conditions, l'Egypte ne doit-elle pas attirer et retenir les regards
                        dela France ? Alexandrie et Marseille, ces deux emporia de la Méditerranée à
                        l'issue des grandes vallées où se déroulent des routes transcontinentales,
                        ne doivent-elles pas se relier par des communica-tions, par des échanges de
                        plus en plus actifs ? La position commerciale prise par les Français dans un
                        pays où leur souvenir est encore vivace et leur influence réelle, est
                        encourageante : l'in-dustrie Marserillaise représente la avec honneur leur
                        personnalité.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>La France est, avec la Belgique et les Etats-Unis, la nation qui a le plus
                        progressé, soit de 93 à 106% ; le Grande-Bretagne a perdu 20 %, l'Allemagne
                        4% à l'importation. Pour plus de précision, on lira avec le plus grand
                        intérêt le rapport substantiel, clair et judicieux de M. R. Girard, consul
                        de France à Alexandrie.</p>
                    <p>Pour conserver, pour étendre leur influence commerciale en Egypte, pour
                        profiter des cir-constances qui s'annoncent sous les augures les plus
                        Favorables, les français ont à redoubler d'efforts et de méthode. Une
                        croisière com-merciale, l'organisation d'une institution Mar-seillaise
                        centralisée pour le placement des jounes gens qui ont reçu une instruction
                        technique, connaissent les langues étrangères, plus de soins donnés par la
                        jeunesse à l'étude du grec moderne et de l'arabe, ce sont autant de sujets à
                        soumettre à la méditation et peut-être antant d'objets à proposer à
                        l'initiative.</p>

                            <p>Three Moors presented themselves yesterday to General Drude and in
                                the name of the Kabyles offered to deliver up their arms within 48
                                hours, and cease all hostilities against the French. General Drude
                                has allowed them until the 8th inst. to make their submission, and
                                if not made on that date he will attack Taddert. Two of the deputies
                                remained in the French camp as a guarantee of good faith. (<hi

                    <head>THE TURKISH ARMY.</head>
                    <p>The Turks have always been essentially and above everything else a military
                        people, says a writer in the September "Contemporary." By this I mean that
                        they soon learned to frame the martial qualities of their race in a strong
                        and comprehensive organisation which raised them from the level of warriors
                        to that of soldiers. The foundations of this system, which for several
                        centuries was far in advance of the conceptions and practice of Europe in
                        the matter of warlike institutions, were laid as early as the first half of
                        the fourteenth century in the reign of their second Sultan, Orkhan
                        (1826-1860). Ever since that time they have disposed of standing armies,
                        regularly recruited and strictly national, instead of the levies of feudal
                        troops and mercenaries, raised only as occasion, arose, in an outside of
                        their own geographical limits, by the European States until a comparatively
                        recent date.</p>
                    <p>To-day the principle upon which the mili-tary establishment of Turkey was
                        reared has become almost universal. The "armed nation" idea is only an
                        extension of it. In many other respects relating to prepar-ation for war,
                        especially in their armament, which included artillery long before it came
                        into use in European camps, the Turks show-ed themselves superior to their
                        European neighbours. This superiority has disappeared long ago. Turkey has
                        still retained all the characteristics of a military State, but the poison
                        of dissolution, which has been circu-lating in her veins for the last two
                        centu-ries, and which thas reduced to profound decay a State once so
                        exuberantly healthy and vigorous, has not spared her military
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>Military service is compulsory in Turkey, but only for the Mussulman
                        population. The Christian subjects of the Sultan are and have always been
                        excluded from the army on the reasonable ground that their presence in it
                        would only be a source of weakness, owing to social and political causes.
                        The differ-rence is so great between the customs of the followers of the
                        Cross and the Cresent re-spectively ; the relationship in which they stand
                        to one another in Turkey places them on such different levels as citizens of
                        the same State; the aspirations of the former, encouraged and supported by
                        Europe, are so dangerous to the integrity of this State, which is founded on
                        the predominance of one re-ligion over the other, that the Sultans have
                        wisely held by the rule not to introduce into the ranks of their troops the
                        Christian element, which, on its side, has not been in the least disposed to
                        protest against an ar-rangement throroughly in accord with its se-cret
                        wishes.</p>
                    <p>In time of war the Ottoman Army could muster close upon a million of men, 10
                        to 15 per cent of whom, however, would be represent-ed by irregular troops
                        and volunteers, that is to say, by Kurdish and Circassian cavalry, and
                        Albanian, Bosniak, and other amateur warriors eager to take up arms in
                        defence of the Crescent. The backbone of this force would be the Turkish
                        contingent, surpassing the others not only in nombers but in all the natural
                        qualities of the soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The bravery of the Turkish "Mehmed" (Tommy) is well known. It proceeds from
                        the absolute unconsciousness of danger. In its blindness it is almost
                        animal-like, but, precisely on that account, knows no limits. Its nature is
                        best revealed by the attention the Turkish soldier is capable of giving in
                        the thick of battle to trivial details ot ordinary life, such as the undoing
                        of his boot strings, which he will sit down calmly and unconcernedly to put
                        right, or the flight of a bird, which he will follow in its course, or a
                        humorous incident which will set him laughing. It is a purely racial
                        characteristic. Contrary to what is generally thought to be the case,
                        religious inspiration has little or nothing to do with it. Islamism only
                        adds to the warlike <hi rend="italic">enthusiasm</hi> of the Turk. It makes
                        him more eager, more enterprising in battle with the infidel, since death in
                        such a case secures to him the tran-scendent rewards of martyrdom ; but his
                        fearlessness is not greater when he is waging war against the latter than
                        when he is fighting his rebellious Albanian or Arab co-religionist, which he
                        is constantly employed in doing by order of the Sultan. He is as enduring as
                        he is brave, and and as disciplined as he is enduring. What he can put up
                        with in the way of hardships of every description is far beyond the capacity
                        of the European soldier.</p>
                    <p>The training of the Turkish soldier is con-fined to elementary drill in the
                        barrack yard. Anything beyond this, especially shooting practice and
                        manœuvres, is considered by the Sultan as likely to offer opportunities for
                        a movement directed against the Palace, and is therefore strictly forbidden.
                        The cadres are formed, with few exceptions, by men who have either received
                        no technical instruction at all and some of whom are even illiterate, or
                        whose educational equipment is that provided by the Military Academy at
                        Constantinople. To give an idea of the spirit which presides over this
                        establishment it will suffice to say that for the last twelve years it has
                        been under the direction of a man whose special and only qualification for
                        the post was his well-proven aptitude to act the part of spy, and that the
                        teaching of chemistry ceased to form part of its programme after the bomb
                        outrage com-mitted two years ago during one of the Selam-lik ceremonies.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>But what interferes even more with the effi-ciency of the Turkish Army is the
                        complete demoralisation into which it has been plunged by the misguided
                        Abdul-Hamid. It has been one of the principal objects of his reign to sow
                        rivalry and dissension in its midst, so that with the exception of the
                        Turkish reigments, who have not been worked upon because they are too
                        devoted to be feared and too stolid to be moved to hatred against their own
                        co-reli-gionists—besides which they are meant to act the part of general
                        policeman in 'the Empire—each racial section is at feud with the other. It
                        is especially among the troops entrusted with the safety of the Imperial
                        residence,and of which there is a whole brigade, that this spirit is
                        fostered, so that it is not uncommon for regular battles to take place
                        between them. No doubt when things have reached this pass the Sultan
                        considers that his object has been exceeded. But the remedy is easy. The
                        guilty battalions are tricked out of their cantonments at Yildiz, surrounded
                        by Turkish regiments, and packed off to some remote part of the Em-pire,
                        others taking their place and retaining it until they have also lost the
                        sense of the limits they may reach in their hostility to one another.</p>

                    <head>A ROYAL DIAMOND.</head>
                    <p>HISTORY OF THE KOH-I-NOR.</p>
                    <p>By the decision of the the Transvaal Legislative Assembly and Council to
                        present the Cullinan diamond to the King, one more of the world's greatest
                        gems will, should His Majesty accept it, become a heirloon of a Royal house.
                        The gift, remarks the "Outlook," is not without precedent in our history,
                        for it was in 1850 that the East India Company offered the Koh-i-Nor to
                        Queen Victoria. These two incidents, however, constitute records as free
                        offerings from representative bodies of the people to a European sovereign.
                        Another distinction, if such it may be called, possessed by the Cullinan is
                        that it is alone among the famous royal diamonds in having no romance. The
                        rest have centuries of picturesque legend and fact to add to their interest,
                        and therefore, although the Cullinan stands supreme in size and possibly in
                        intrinsic value, it will lack the pecular fascination attaching to
                        possessious which have been the load-stars of conquest, the doom of empires,
                        and talismans of evil to their successive owners.</p>
                    <p>Strangely enough the crown diamond which has enjoyed the most evil reputation
                        is the Koh-i-Nor itself. Its baleful history goes back over fifty centuries,
                        but much of this is mythical. It will suffice to begin the record with the
                        middle of the sixteenth century, when the jewell formed one of the eyes of
                        the peacock of the Great Mogul. It was one of the treasures which lured
                        Nadir Shah with his Persian hordes to the sack of Delhi, but when the city
                        fell it was not among the fabulous wealth of loot that rewarded the victors.
                        The investiga-tions of the discomfited Shah, however, at last elicited from
                        a woman of the harem that the stone was hidden in the turban of the deposed
                        Emperor Mahomed This information gave an opportunity for Oriental subtlety
                        which Nadir was not slow to act upon. There is an old Eastern ceremony,
                        wherein monarchs, as a mark of amity and reconciliation, exchange turbans at
                        great fanctions. Hence he pro-claimed his intention of placing his Royal
                        captive once more upon the throne of Delhi, and ordered a reception worthy
                        of the occasion. Then, with many professions of brotherly regard, he took
                        off his own bejewelled headgear and presented it to his dumfounded rival.
                        The discomfiture of Mohamed was complete, but his native dignity carried him
                        through the ordeal, With such composure did he return his own turban that
                        the conqueror felt a ter-rible dread lest the story had been fictitious.
                        Bringing the proceedings to a premature close, he retired hastily to his
                        tent to search his new possession. Here, in its silken hiding place, he
                        found his heart's desire, and in a transport of joy bestowed upon it the
                        present title, "Moun-tain of Light."</p>
                    <p>The evil destiny accompanying the posses-sion of the Koh-i-nor soon overtook
                        Nadir Shah on his return with plunder valued at sixty millions. Eight years
                        after his return to Persia he was assassinated by his nobles, and his feeble
                        son, Shah Rokh, was deposed. But although the unhappy young monareh yielded
                        his throne, not-even the loss of his eyes could make him give up the
                        diamond. Its fascination however, was equally strong upon his chief
                        oppressor, Aga Mahomet, who followed his blind victim in the disguise of a
                        pilgrim to his 'retreat at Meshed. The town was invested and Rokh was sized.
                        Then indescribable tortures wrung from him all his other treasures, but were
                        powerless to make him yield up the Koh-i-Nor. Ere he died of his terrible
                        sufferings he was restored to his throne by Ahmed Shab founder of the Afghan
                        Empire, the price being the jewel itself. Thus it was transferred, with all
                        its fateful influence, to the Durani dynasty. Eventually, after a tragic
                        history it came into the possession of Ranjit Sing, the "Lion of the
                        Punjaub," with whom it remained until his death, in 1839, and was found in
                        the Lahore treasury when the Crown property was taken over by the East India
                        Company to defray the Government debts.</p>

                    <head>THE MOSQUITO IN ENGLAND.</head>
                    <p>One has heard so much from time to time about the woeful experiences of those
                        who go to the nethermost parts of the earth to be bitten by the mosquito
                        that one might almost imagine that the stay-at-home Englishman were unable
                        to enjoy a similar experience. As a matter of fact, we in England have a
                        very virulent member of the tribe, belonging to the genus "culex," which
                        deserves quite as much as that other annoying parasite — with whose name its
                        own rhymes—the epithet of "irritans" bestowed upon the most unwelcome of
                        bedfel-lows. Frequent endeavour has been made to distinguish between the
                        mosquito familiar to us in this country and the common or garden gnat, but
                        as a fact the two are one and the same, although when one has been badly
                        bitten it may excite greater commiseration to speak of the injury as the
                        handiwork of a mosquito. But there "is" a difference between the kinds of
                        bites which a gnat — or a mosquito, if you prefer it — can inflict, though
                        up till now it has passed the comprehension of mankind to discover quite why
                        the creature's proboscis — so fearfully and wonderfully made in seven
                        separate parts — produces so much irritation and discomfort. It is
                        undoubtedly partly the fault of the bitten one's composition if he, or she,
                        feel it more severely than another ; but it is agreed among experts that in
                        certain weathers the bite of the mosquito is worse than in others. They say
                        that there is no poison gland in the mosquito, as in the adder for instance,
                        and it has been suggested that the irritant substance is contained in the
                        saliva of the beast. To most of us, however, it does not very mach matter.
                        We get bitten, some-times badly and sometimes mildly ; and it is always
                        unpleasant.</p>
                    <p>There are, however, those to whom the bark of the mosquito is nearly, if not
                        quite; as bad as his bite. People with nerves say that they cannot sleep at
                        night if there is a gnat buzzing in the room, but at bed time the insect is
                        really far less bloodthirstily inclined than earlier in the evening. If you
                        want to discover the mosquito at his best—or rather, at his worst—you should
                        in the gloaming seek the shady walks of the woodland, especially in the
                        neighbourhood of swampy places and stagnant pools. These in England, as
                        abroad, are the happy hunting grounds of the mosquito, al-though he is so
                        well able to adapt himself to his surroundings that you may even meet him in
                        St. James's Park and other civilised places. Even the cistern of a London
                        hotel, at which some Americans were recently staying, did duty as a
                        breeding-place for a colony of mos-quitoes which were no less indignant at
                        being evicted than were the Americans who had been accused, before the open
                        cistern was discovered, of importing the undesirable aliens in their
                        baggage.</p>
                    <p>This year the mosquitoes have not been quite so troublesome as usual, for the
                        lower temperature seems to have reduced their ardour, but during the average
                        summer, life in the country is frequently unbearable on account of the
                        persistent attacks of the insects. Native dwellers in mosquito-stricken
                        districts get more or less used to mosquito bite, as the result, no doubt,
                        of a process of vaccination which renders the bites innocuous in the course
                        of time. But visitors to the country are frequently so badly bitten that
                        their arms and hands swell to an alarming extent, the irrita-tion and
                        subsequent stiffness of the affected part being exceedingly painful. The
                        effect of the poison on the general health of the sufferer is also most
                        marked several cases, and is often worse than the sting of a bee or wasp. As
                        for remedies, none of them is of any use un-less applied immediately after
                        the bite. Am-monia is good, and so is a lump of washing soda rubbed on the
                        wound, but once the poison has begun to spread, the only thing to ease the
                        irritation and pain is the frequent application of hot water fomentations.
                        Like the umbrella, which is so seldom needed when one remembers not to leave
                        it at home, a small bottle of liquid ammonia carried in the pocket during
                        one's walks abroad, act s asa sort of charm against the unwelcome attentions
                        of the British mosquito. It should be added, in justice to the gentlemen
                        mosquitoes, that the capacity for biting is confined solely to the lady
                        repre-sentatives of the rave. The eternal feminine again!</p>

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
