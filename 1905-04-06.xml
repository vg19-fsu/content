                    <head>AN INSTITUTE FOR CAIRO.</head>
                    <p> Nearly three years have passed since, under the heading of "Wanted-an
                        Institute," we pointed out the great need that exists in 'Cairo for an
                        institution on the lines of the Young Men's Societies that render such
                        important services to the communities of the great cities of England and
                        America. It was just about the same time that the promotors of the "British
                        Recreation Club" began to put their scheme forward, and those who had taken
                        up the ideas we had advocated, notwithstanding that the two projects were
                        entirely different in their aim and scope, felt that the simultaneous
                        pushing of both would be prejudicial to the interests and prospects of each.
                        Now, however, that the Club has not only been launched but can look upon
                        itself as one of the established institutions of the city, there is no
                        longer any reason why the other scheme should not be taken up and developed
                        in accordance with the original proposals. In the letter which Mr. Keichline
                        has sent us the general nature of the scheme is explained and the character
                        that the institution should assume indicated. No one who has any
                        acquaintance with the conditions prevailing in Cairo can doubt for a moment
                        that our correspondent has but voiced a real want and one that all who are
                        interested in the social and moral development of the Capital shou'd take a
                        pleasure in supplying in the fullest and most liberal manner. That ample
                        funds will be forthcoming we have no fear, provided only that the initial
                        steps be taken in such a way as to command the confidence of those who may
                        legitimately be asked to render the project the aid it will require while
                        yet in its first stage.</p>
                    <p>Cairo, like all other large cities, has among its residents a considerable
                        number of young, men who from various causes are separated from all the home
                        and other educational and social influences that are of such importance, to
                        the right development of character, and there is no work that can be
                        suggested 'more worthy of the most generous support than the realisation of
                        a scheme which will provide the best available substitute for those
                        influences. There are, unfortunately, only too many temptations in the way
                        of men in general, to spend their leisure hours in pleasures that, if not
                        destructive of morals, are certainly injurious to all the higher qualities
                        that it is to the interest of the individual and of the community should be
                        nurtured in every possible way. It will of<cb n="6"/> course be essential
                        that the project be carried out upon broad and at the same time elastic
                        lines. To be effective for its purpose, while necessarily from its scope
                        limited to the Englishspeaking community, it must keep open doors for all
                        who are willing to enter and profit from the many advantages it will have to
                        offer. It must therefore be cosmopolitan, non-sectarian, and non political,
                        and summed up in the briefest manner, its aim should be to furnish a centre
                        where its members may find, always at their service, all the comforts of a
                        good club. coupled with facilities for the advancement of their mental and
                        moral interests. In its actual working each member should enjoy the utmost
                        liberty. His membership should not necessarily involve his undergoing or
                        undertaking any scheme of self-improvement. If he prefers to avail himself
                        of the institute merely as a club he should be quite free to do so.. In
                        short, the institute should be for Cairo what the "Polytechnic" Institute
                        has been for London, a centre where the members can find ever at their
                        command a comfortable place wherein to pass their leisure either in
                        self-improvement by studies, in healthy and rational amusements, or in
                        social intercourse with their fellow members, always feeling that they are
                        there associated with others valuing such advantages and free from all
                        restrictions other than those necessary for the just co-. ordination of
                        their common interests. We trust therefore that our correspondent's appeal
                        will receive the ready and widespread support it deserves, and that no one
                        in a position to assist will hesitate to do so in whatever manner may seem
                        most suitable after a full discussion of the project.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday morning, a severe earthquake took place at Agra and also in a
                            northerly direction towards Simla. Enormous damage was done, and it is
                            leared there has been a great loss of life, especially at Lahore where

                            catastrophe. It is reported that every house at Dharmsala has been
                            levelled and that some-Europeans and many natives have been killed.
                            Deihi suffered considerably, but none were killed. From many other

                    <p>NO LIVES LOST.</p>
                    <p>LOSS UNCOVERED BY INSURANCE.</p>
                    <p>The Abbas Helmy Theatre at Alexandria was destroyed by fire at an early hour
                        this morning.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday evening, the usual performance was given by Gatti's circus troupe,
                        which ended at a quarter past midnight. At 12.20 a.m. the dynamo which
                        supplies the electric light for the theatre was stopped, and by 12.40 a.m.
                        everyone connected with the theatre had left the building, nothing untoward
                        having happened.</p>
                    <p>At half past one in the morning, however, the alarm was given to the Fire
                        Brigade that the "Abbas" was on fire, and on arriving on the spot a few
                        minutes afterwards they found the large building in flames. The fire, which
                        had apparently originated under the stage, had spread with alarming rapidity
                        to the auditorium and boxes, and in a short time the theatre resembled one
                        vast roaring furnace.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, no one was in the building at the time, and there was. no loss
                        of life. The horses belonging to the circus troupe were, however, stabled
                        under the stage and efforts were at once directed to saving the, animals.
                        This was done, though three of the horses unfortunately were charred by the
                        flames before they could be got out. t</p>
                    <p>Little or none of the belongings of the unfortunate artistes belonging to the
                        circus troupe could be saved, as the conflagration had got a strong hold of
                        the building. The efforts of the Fire Brigade were mainly directed to saving
                        the walls of the theatre and the surrounding buildings, and it reflects
                        great credit on them that the fire was so successfully kept within bounds,
                        none of the adjacent buildings being affected. Shortly after the outbreak
                        the roof of the building collapsed with a tremendous crash, and now nothing
                        remains of the theatre but the four walls, the whole place being entirely
                        gutted.</p>
                    <p>By 5 o'clock this morning the fire was thoroughly mastered by the Brigade,
                        but the firemen are still engaged in pumping water on the smouldering mass
                        of charred woodwork and distorted iron pillars.</p>
                    <p>The cause of the outbreak has not as yet been ascertained, and the sympathies
                        of all will be with the proprietors, Messrs. A. &amp; G. Monterrato, when it
                        is known that their loss is not covered by insurance. The theatre was built
                        in 1894 and was valued at something like £16,000.</p>

                        sent in its report. The Assembly has agreed to the draft decree and has only
                        made a few slight modifications, which we mentioned recently. Mr. Machell
                        was present at the meeting.</p>

                        Municipality for Cairo.</p>

                    <head>JUDICIAL ADVISER'S REPORT.</head>
                    <p>REVIEW OF PAST YEAR.</p>
                    <p>We extract the following passages from the Report of the Judicial Adviser on
                        the past</p>
                    <p>year:-</p>
                    <p>CRIME.</p>
                    <p>The Procureur General thus concludes his review of crime: That the increase
                        in crime, properly so called, is less by half in 1904 than in 1903, while
                        criminal robbery has not risen (it has in fact fallen by 20)-that the rise
                        in délits is small in comparison with that of the last years, and no more
                        than what might be fairly expected; that such increase as there is accounted
                        for by petty cases of assault and by a more exacting standard in the matter
                        of false accusations while theft and crop-destroying have decreased, and
                        cattle-poisoning not increased; all this, while it cannot be called a
                        brilliant result, at least indicates a less marked tendency of serious crime
                        to remain on the increase, and is, so far, a matter for satisfaction. </p>
                    <p>MEHKEMEHS.</p>
                    <p>The state of things, at present, is far from encouraging, and it is not
                        astonishing that native reformers should be at length awakening to the
                        urgent necessity of serious reforms in these Courts. Notably, in suits
                        concerning private Wakfs, scarcely a week passes without some more or less
                        serious complaint being received at this Ministry. The majority of these
                        private Wakf suits are pure questions of property and private rights and do
                        not in any way affect the religion of the people. Some of the more
                        enlightened among native reformers therefore consider that the wisest and
                        most satisfactory solution for all concerned would be for the Mehkemehs to
                        hand over all that relates to private Wakfs (Wakfs Ahly) to the Native
                        Tribunals, retaining their competence in charitable Wakfs only (Wakts
                        Khairy) which, being of a more spiritual nature, fall more properly within
                        the jurisdiction of religious Courts. This would certainly be a solution of
                        the difficulty and its feasibility is under the consideration of the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>There has been some attempt, in quarters hostile to the project, to make
                        capital out of the case of Mr. Beck and the stimulus which that deplorable
                        affair has given in England to a revival of the agitation for a Court of
                        Criminal Appeal. It may therefore perhaps be desirable to say a few words on
                        this subject.</p>
                    <p>The suggestion is, of course, that the Egyptian Government is proposing to
                        abolish the very safeguard which that case has shown to be imperatively
                        necessary. Two considerations suffice to demonstrate the fallacy of this
                        contention. The first is that there is no real analogy between the functions
                        of the Egyptian Court of Criminal Appeal-which it is proposed to suppress
                        here-and those of the English Court of Criminal Appeal-which it is desired
                        to introduce at home. The one reviews, on the papers, the findings of fact
                        of Tribunals which have heard the witnesses; the other would either rehear
                        the case de novo, witnesses and all, or else order a new trial at which the
                        witnesses would be reheard. Whatever advantages, therefore, might attach to
                        the latter system-they are highly problematical, the question being, as is
                        generally admitted, an exceedingly controversial one-they are clearly not
                        possessed by the Egyptian institution which only exceptionally hears the
                        witnesses. The second consideration is that the learned Commissioners
                        appointed to inquire into the Beck case, and report thereon to the Home
                        Secretary, have not, as a matter of fact, seen fit to recommend the
                        institution of a Court of Criminal Appeal, which they apparently regard
                        -and, it is submitted, rightly (1) <note>(1) "In reply to Sir R. Reid
                            (Dumfries Burghs) Mr, Balfour states he understood the balance of expert
                            opinion was against and not in favor of a Court of Criminal Appeal" (see
                            debate in the House of Lommons reported in the "Times" of March 9th
                            1905).</note>-as calculated to impair the dignity and finality of the
                        sentences of the existing Criminal Courts. They content themselves with
                        recommending that some machinery should be provided for secur ing the
                        possible consideration, by a superior Court, of crucial points of law
                        decided by the judge at the trial. Such machinery already exists, in the
                        Egyptian system, in the powers of the Court of Cassation, before which any
                        convicted person has the faculty of showing that a point of law has been
                        erroneously decided, to his disadvantage, and that he has consequently not
                        had a tair trial, or that his conviction is bad in law. If he succeeds, the
                        Court of Cassation either quashes the conviction or orders a new trial. We
                        may, therefore, dismiss the idea that the Beck case has any real bearing on
                        the question of Assize Courts for Egypt. The ques tion remains whether, in
                        any other respect, the situation has undergone any change since last year.
                        Unfortunately it would appear that, it there has been any change, it has
                        been for the worse, crime having again increased, as may be seen from the
                        report of the Procureur General, though not, I am glad to say, in the same
                        ratio as in the preceding year.</p>
                    <p>NATIVE. NATIVE.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the project for introducing notables as assessors in the Assize
                        Court, the Judicial Adviser states that the proposal raised such a general
                        outcry that it was thought better to let it drop, and it was consequently
                        abandoned even before the scheme reached the Legislative Council,</p>
                    <p>Mr. McIlwraith then proceeds to make the following statements as to the
                        mutual distrust of native for native :-</p>
                    <p>It is one of the most significant phenomena of the problem of government in
                        Egypt that, though the introduction of European officials and of European
                        methods is systematically denounced in native organs, yet the most gingerly
                        step in the direction of conferring greater power and increased
                        responsibility upon natives-whether they be First instance <cb n="5"/>
                        judges, omdehs, notables, or any other body of men-invariably inspires, in
                        the upper classes, feelings of the most profound distrust and, not
                        infrequently, occasions an outburst of genuine alarm.</p>
                    <p>EGYPTIAN CIVIL CODE.</p>
                    <p>After citing various cases to prove the defective drafting of the Egyptian
                        Civil Code, the Judicial Adviser remarks:-</p>
                    <p>But it is not only in the drafting that Egyptian legislation is defective but
                        also in the tive but total omission of a number of important subjects and
                        the lacunæ and obscurities in the provisions regarding others. Thus Egyptian
                        legislation contains no law of copyright, no law of patents, no law of trade
                        marks, and Egypt has consequently been unable to adhere to the various
                        International Conventions relating to these most important subjects. There
                        are constant complaints from the commercial communities as to the loss and
                        inconvenience caused to them by the absence of a satisfactory law on these
                        questions of every-day applica tion. Again, the land law is very defective.
                        The law of easements (servitudes) is so brief and incomplete as to give rise
                        to constant difficulties. Wakfs and contracts of a similar nature are
                        governed exclusively by Mohamedan law, which varies according to the
                        different rites, not to mention the divergences in the views of the various
                        authorities of the same rite. Obviously the only remedy for a body of
                        legislation so radically defective is to simplify the modus legiferendi in
                        Egypt. That the Egyptian Government should be compelled to apply to fourteen
                        Powers whenever it is desired to effect an improvement in Codes of the
                        calibre above described or to provide legislation on subjects of the
                        importance above referred to is obviously absurd.</p>
                    <p>LAND REGISTRATION.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the provisions of the above project, the Judicial Adviser
                        remarks: "It would undoubtedly effect a very considerable change in the
                        existing system and there can be very little doubt that the change would
                        prove beneficial to the community at large. Indeed the defects of the
                        present system are almost universally recognised and its continued existence
                        is mainly due to the circumstance that it has hitherto proved impossible to
                        formulate an acceptable scheme to take its place. Now, however that such a
                        scheme has been voted by a majority of the technical delegates, it is
                        greatly to be hoped that political considerations may not induce the Powers
                        to veto the project and deprive Egypt of the benefits of a reform for which
                        she has been struggling for so many years."</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>London, March 25.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday the troopship "Dilwara" left Southampton with artillery and
                        infantry drafts and various details on board for Gibraltar and Malta.
                        Amongst the officers is Major C. L. E. Eustace-Robertson, D.S.O., King's
                        Royal Rifle Corps, who joins the 1st Battalion at Cairo. The "Dilwara" is
                        due at Malta on the 2nd April and at Southampton on the 11th following. Her
                        return will close the trooping season</p>
                    <p>of 1904-05.</p>
                    <p>Captain Claude J. Hawker, Coldstream Guards, commanding the Camel Corps of
                        the Egyptian Army, has just been promoted to field rank in the Guards. Major
                        Hawker entered the Guards close on fifteen years ago, the last six of which
                        have been spent in the Khedive's service. He earned the Egyptian medal with
                        clasps for the operations against the Khalifa in 1899, shortly after he
                        joined the Egyptian Army.</p>
                    <p>Captain S. J. Somerville, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, attached lately to
                        the Indian Army, has been restored to the establishment of the Inniskillings
                        vice Captain R. C. Pierce, appointed adjutant of the 3rd Battalion.</p>
                    <p>A feeling has been created that the War Office is trying to conceal the names
                        of the fraudulent contractors in connection with the Cape Stores scandal. On
                        the other hand, Mr. Arnold-Forster has given all the knowledge he possessed
                        on the matter. There is every reason to believe that every difficulty was
                        put in the way of his doing so.</p>
                    <p>The battleship "London" (Captain Philip F. Tillard), which was commissioned
                        at Portsmouth on the 7th June, 1902, for service with the Mediterranean
                        Fleet, will return home from that station on 24th prox. She will pay off the
                        following day at Portsmouth, and will be recommissioned for another tour of
                        service in Mediterranean waters. Her crew will be partially drawn from the
                        battleship "Ramillies" in the Chatham-Sheerness Reserve.</p>

                        to subscribe to financial concerns which were being formed. The hope of
                        having their capital quickly increased has encouraged many to invest. And as
                        for those who value intellectual capital as much as the other, they go to

                    <p>The recent Japanese successes in the field hate been followed by a wonderfal
                        triumph in the financial world. The fact that as the war wanton the Japanese
                        were able to get better terms, and had the shrewdness to take ad- vantage of
                        them, will always be reoognised as an additional feather in their cap. By
                        how many unnecessary millions they have secured this bloodless viotory, is
                        the question everyone is asking tb-day. Some say it beats all records,
                        excepting only that notable one—the Trans- vaal War Loan, of a similar
                        amount This was subscribed 39 times over and serves still to remind the
                        world what the United.Kingdom can do in times of stress, as compared with
                        disunited Russia.</p>
                    <p>Naturally these large applications, coming in conjunction with'the Stock
                        Exchange settle- ment, have caused a shortage of ready money, but too much
                        attention need not be given to this, as when the money is released, which is
                        promised at an early date, there is every like- lihood-of continued ease. In
                        fact, these efforts on the part of the public to collect money, and grasp a
                        profit^ to be had for the asking often, have the effect of increasing the
                        floating supply of capital Nevertheless, oven after a period of comparative
                        freedom from new issues for several years, it is not advisable to overdo the
                        calls on the publio, and this is realised by the leading financial houses,
                        who. are quite alive to the situation.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, stock markets are in- ; active this week, and the
                        arrangement of the ! Account has occupied dealers, to the exclusion Of fresh
                        business. The large number of new issues now on the market—particularly t^e
                        new Japanese 4} per cent, stock referred to Move—have kept the public out a
                        good deal, 1 find have, moreover, caused a distinct scarcity of money in the
                        settlement. There is a decided feeling that the rush of new issues has been
                        Sufficient, and that it has, for the time being, I put a check on the
                        activity that was bo marked i _ in the investment stocks during the early
                        part ] of the month.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks, after starting the week dull, have rallied sharply during
                        the past two days, 1 led by Agricultural Banks, which have been I bought
                        largely for Continental account— i especially from Paris. The price has come
                        up I over £2 to 12f; It is rumoured that a further 1 issue, both of Ordinary
                        and Debentures, is in preparation, and' the present upward move is very
                        likely "paving the way" for this. National Banks are a good market at 21 J,
                        whilst other shares are steady, nth' little change. Salt &amp; Sodas are a
                        dull point .at If on the new issue. Amongst the new companies, Corporation
                        of -Western Egypt have risen to $, on forced buying. The mining section has
                        sagged off somewhat again, and prices show a distinct set-back from last
                        week's-account, but the 1 market is not a bad one by any means, and ! ought
                        to be worth attention at present prices, lor the drop is certainly only a
                        temporary one.</p>

                        is called in .the inscriptions "the northern oasis of Amon-hotep," implying

                        reign of Shishak IV; (about 850- B.C.), which were obtained by Capt. Ly6ns
                        from the neighbourhood of Mat. They are written in oursive characters, and
                        the larger of the two relates to a disputed claim as to the proprietorship
                        of a particular spring. The case was brought before the Egyptian governor
                        upon his arrival in the oasis, but after a delay of several years was
                        decided, not by, him,. but by an oracle of the god of the place. Both the
                        governor and several-of the other officials mentioned on the two monuments
                        bear Libyan names, and it is clear that the oasis was inhabited at the time

                        described as having erected it of "good white stono" and as having covered
                        its.doors with bronze from Asia. There is a long list of the offerings
                        presented to the go.l which begins with "the wine of the Oasis," as well as

                        was very perfect: "well*, sunk to a depth of two or three hundred or even
                        live hundred cubits, pour streams of water from their mouths," while the
                        peasants wero in the habit of watering "their little enclosures every third
                        day iu summer and every sixth day iu' winter, which is the cause ol the
                        great fertility of the land, though the sky is always cloudless,"
                        Oiympiodorus further noticed that "the rocks of the mountain' which extends
                        from the Thebaid into the oasis" were full. of "marine shells and oysters,"
                        and drew the conclusion that the oases had once been islands. * .In spile of

                        prosperity of the oases continued iuto Coptio times, as is attested by the
                        ruined monasteries and Christian cemeteries which are scattered over them.
                        With the' withdrawal of the Roman garrisons, ' however, . and the. Mobamedou

                        neglected, andmtlarial fever invaded a district which had once been regarded
                        as a health resort.</p>

                    <p>This Company is formed for the purpose of carrying on the business ot an
                        Investment,Exploration^! Development Company, especially in Egypt and the
                        8oudan. ^ For some years private Syndicates have been exploring conoesffons
                        granted by the Egyptian and Soudan Governments with tery satisfactory
                        results; districts previously unexplored have been opened up, and laud
                        hitherto of little value is now steadily improving in price, and is in great
                        demand. The irrigation and reclamation schemes projected are likely to still
                        farther increase the investment demand for laud In view of the above, it ia
                        proposed that this Company shall pay epeoial attention to business connected
                        with land development irrigation schemes, and reclamation works. It is
                        generally admitted that the many industries of Egypt, unler the careful
                        supervision of the Government, are now malting stead, progress. It is -
                        intended to act as financialagents in JJoodoi^ Fans and elsewhere for laud
                        development, mining and other companies, and i. is anticipated that
                        considerable profit will result from this source. In view of the increasing
                        interest of Freooh Investors in Bgyptian Securities, it is proposed to open
                        a Branch Offise ia Paris at a.: early date. As the success of Company of
                        this nature is to a large extent dependent upon a thorough knowledge of
                        looal conditions, it is extrem ely satisfactory to have secured the
                        servioes, as Director and Agent-General in Egypt, of Mr. Hooker, late
                        Geueral Manager of the Bgyptian Salt and Soda Company, formerly
                        Direotor-Ueneral of the Egyptian Government Salt Department in Egypt ;his
                        knowledge of the conatry and local business conditions is probably
