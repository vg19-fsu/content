          <head>POWER IN SYRIA</head>
          <p>A distinguished naval officer, Lamberto Vannutelli, has recently returned from an
            expedition on which he was sent by the Italian Geographical Society, and has brought
            back interesting geographical and commercial particulars with regard to the progress
            which the principal nations of Europe are making in the penetration and industrial
            expansion of Syria and Eastern Asia Minor. New railways, lines of navigation, the large
            investments of European capital in commerce with the country, and the patient labours of
            the religious missions and of the consular agents have combined to undermine the
            prejudices of the East and have opened the country to the commerce and industries of all
            civilised people. The distinguished explorer, in an interview which he gave to the Rome
            "Messaggero," compares the positions of the various European nations, and points out the
            enormous advantages which Germany has been able to obtain by the singular and clever
            position which she has taken up of protectress of the Turkish Empire, which has rendered
            her most powerful at Constantinople. The oriental journeys of: the Emperor Williám were
            followed by a crowd of students, merchants, and capitalists, who mandated the Empire.
            German officers reorganised the army ; the firm of Krupp furnished cannon ; and thanks
            to the advantage of position, German capital has been employed in the most lucrative
            undertakings. Finally, the Deutsche Bank of Berlin, after making s. loan of 30 million
            marks (£1,500,000), was able to initiate the system of political railways which had its
            outcome in the plan for the Baghdad railway, which is the most important concession ever
            made by Turkey, and which, when the financial and political difficulties opposing its
            construction are overcome,? will form an all-powerful factor for the development of
            German interests in Asiatic Turkey. France, also, says Signor Vannutelli, has still-a
            very important position partly due to her religious protectorate. Her very numerous
            religious missions and schools, 'the great medical university of Beirut, and the
            numerOus consulates established everywhere, even in the interior, are all centres of
            French in. Buence and sympathy, while her important commercial undertakings, such as
            coal mines, railways, and ports, are supported by the inVestment of the enormous capital
            of two miljards of francs (£8,000,000). Notwithstand. during all this, the great
            extension of German influence has been greatly to the detriment of French interests, and
            French commerce has diminished until it now represents only 9.36 mer cent. of the whole.
            , Great Britain, with her occupation of Cyprus and Egypt, has a dominating position in
            the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, and from commercial point of view accounts for
            38.60 ent of imports. 'I thanks to her consular serFice, the constant visits of her
            warships, even the smallest ports of the coast, and her immense influence in the Persian
            Gulf, she may be said to hold her own against the German invasion ; and thanks also to
            the im the importance which she gives to the shortest route between Europe and India, to
            the valuable commercial enterprise which she undertakes, ach as mineral works and the
            service of gas, water, and posts in the principal cities, she may be said to keep in
            touch with all that happens, and to be the preponderating political fluence in the
            country.</p>

              Greek papyri from Theadelphia, in the Fayoum, now preserved in the Cairo Museum, bave
              afforded the necessary evidence upon the matter and prove that the events referred to

              purple. But it settles a debated chronological question definitively.</p>

          <head>THE VILLAGE TRAGEDY.<lb/>ANOTHER VERSION.</head>
          <p>It appears that the version at first circulated of the regrettable shooting incident at
            Warak, in which M. Grandmoulin is implicated, was not correct. </p>
          <p>The circumstances are now said to be as follows. M. Grandmoulin was returning from a
            shooting excursion accompanied by a native boy who carried his cartridge bag. He was
            walking along with his gun on his shoulder and holding his bicycle in one hand, the boy
            followed behind, when shortly afterwards another boy of 13 came up and wanted to carry
            part of the load in order to share in the recompense. The first boy naturally objected
            and a dispute arose. M. Grandmoulin, still holding his bicycle; turned round to put an
            end to the dispute, when by some means or other his g'n was discharged and the second
            boy received a fatal wound </p>
          <p>The "Lewa" publishes a letter from the head of the ghaffirs of the locality, stating
            that M. Grandmoulin had deliberately shot the boy, in order to avenge himself for some
            trouble he had had with the Egyptian Government. The publication of such a ridiculous
            assertion by the "Lewa" only proves that, despite all its protestations, our Nationalist
            contemporary never lets an occasion slip of displaying its xenophobia </p>

            at Damiętta and Faraskour. </p>
          <p>Apropos of Saad Pasha Zaghlowl's speech at the General Assembly "Al Mimbar" remarks:
            "Which of the Minister's declarations are we to accept, that instruction in a foreign
            language is one of the chief needs of the country,—if in that case his preoccupation in
            favour of substituting the national language for Engli-h must turn out fatally-or that
            he hoped for instruction in Arabic on account of its utility ?..... Saad Pasha states
            that the pupils of the Government schools are very weak in foreign languages, but he
            certainly does not realise the causes of their weakness. In any case it has no relation
            whatever with instruction in Arabic." </p>
          <p>Our contemporary has hardly, in our opinion, done justice to Saad Pasha's main thesis,
            viz. that till teachers and textbooks could be provided any sudden adoption of Arabic as
            the sole medium of instruction would cause the greatest confusion and disorder in the
            work of the Department. </p>

            <dateline>Luxor, Sunday.</dateline>
            <p>A very successful concert took place at the Winter Palace Hotel on Saturday evening,
              in aid of the Luxor Hospital for Natives The friends who kindly interested themselves
              in organising the entertainment worked hard for its success, and they must have been
              gratified at the result of their efforts, for not only was a most enjoyable evening
              spent, but the very creditable sum of £29 109. was obtained for the charity, nearly £4
              of this being handed in by the ladies who offered their services as programme sellers. </p>
            <p>The manager, M. Schalch, always ready to further a good cause, had converted the
              spacious lounge into a perfect concert hall, with an improvised platform decorated
              with palms, and at 9 o'clock to the minute the proceedings began. </p>
            <p>The promoters were most fortunate in obtaining to help of such clever amateurs, and
              especially in enlisting the sympathy of Fraulein Terese Schnackenburg, a lady whose
              vocal talents are of a very high order indeed, and who charmed her hearers by singing
              two extra songs besides those on the programme, all rendered with a style and finish
              that one has not often the good fortune to hear in this country. </p>
            <p>The pianoforte playing of Mr. Ewart was also a great treat, while Miss Allen's fine
              and sympathetic voice was greatly appreciated, and it is to the energy and talents of
              this lady, that the success of the concert is in a great measure owing. Space fails to
              mention individually each performer, but the entire programme was, as the chairman
              (the Rev. G F. Sams) put it, on an unusually high level, and the last notes of the
              graceful "Lullaby" song by Miss Allen in response to an encore, were heard with regret
              by all. The concert was honoured by the presence of H.R.H Prince Freidrick Wilhelm of
              Prussia, and amongst others who took tickets (nearly all of whom might be seen in the
              audience) were : Count Schulenburg, Freihen von Kuyphausen, the Earl and Countess of
              Carnarvon, Sir. Charles Cust, Count and Countess Lichtenfelde, Graf Edler von der
              Planitz, Mme Fräuhel, Countess Skannisky, Mme Klobukowski, M. Valdrôme, Lady Ewart and

            <p>The Winter Palace is still full, and is keeping up the weekly dances with much
              spirit. The hospital dance was a great success, resulting in a sum of over £20 ; while
              the Gymkhanas each Thursday are still going strong, and continue to attract large
              audiences, last week's meeting producing a record of 152 tickets sold at the gate,
              besides season tickets. </p>
            <p>An interesting visitor who has just left for Cairo is M. Chartran, the famong French
              artist, and amongst other visitors still at the hotel are Lord and Lady Carnarvon, who

          <p>Mlles Vera and Nadesda Chernetzka have already achieved no inconsiderable success
            during their tours in Russia and other European countries ; and their début before a
            Cairo audience on Monday evening at the Savoy will ensure an enthusiastic reception at
            their future appearances. They are certainly gifted with an immense natural power ; and
            if their performances are somewhat lacking in delicacy and refinement the fault is one
            which doubtless experience will rectify. Thus in Mlle. </p>
          <p>Vera's rendering of Bach's Orgue Toccata and - Fugue, though her execution was
            brilliant, she was very much inclined to force expression by too much pedalțing However,
            in several of her later items she displayed a really admirable feeling, and restraint.
            She is undoubtedly a remarkably fine pianist, and her treatment of Tschaikowski's
            "Paraphrase" was received with all the enthusiasm it deserved. </p>
          <p>Mlle. Nadesda Chervetzka is the 'fortunate possessor of a contralto voice of great
            power and compass ; and we look forward to hearing her again under better acoustic
            conditions She has an intensely dramatic instinct, but like her sister is inclined
            rather to force her effects. She was heard at her best in Taskin's "Les Cloches" and
            Rubinstein's "Pandero," and her rendering of the "Habanera" song from </p>
          <p>Carmen" was also excellent. Her natural voice is so magnificent that we only regret
            that she has not been able to devote more time to perfooting its production. </p>

          <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE."<lb/>"HERODIADE."</head>
          <byline>(From our THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
          <p>"Hérodiade" is undoubtedly a fine opera, whatever one may think of the story. Massenet
            shows real strength, beauty, and what one may call an appropriate spirit throughout ; at
            some momeðts perhaps he is above himself. In the Temple scene, for example, the m sic
            for the palm dance has á stern rhythm and set purpose that the great old writers
            themselves might not have disowned Herod's theme throughout is passionate, strong,
            wilful : Hérodiade's appeal to him, "Ne me refuse pas-rappelle-toi," has great beauty ;
            and the love duet in the cavern is a splendid episode of passion and purity meeting.
            That duet is certainly incongruous to the story. John the Baptist is too human, almost
            "feministe," M. Massenet himself, it might be, in a moment of religious fervour ; and
            Salomé seems too innocent, too ready to be a convert: Oscar Wilde's idea is surely more
            logical--the passionate oriental who loves the ascetic, dead or alive,' with the
            fullest, most sensuous desire. </p>
          <p>The orchestra again was (as in "La Reine Fiamette") really excellent, and M.
            Archimbault in thorough harmony with it, and with his singers. It was curious, though,
            and revealing to note how the one singer to whom he did not have to devote strenuous
            attention was Mme Chaix-Bonheur. Whatever one may say of her voice, as a voice, sher use
            of it is superb ; ber rendering of the appeal to the Fetrarch was beyond praise for its
            subtlety and suppressed passion. Really one has to recant one's personal taste and
            forget everything in admiration of her ert. M. Mezy as Herod was also excellent; he,
            too, showed real subtlety in "Salomé, Salomé," though it was his high notes, and not his
            delicacy, that moved the house Mme Baron, though she looked charming and acted well, was
            not at all satisfactory, and her voice gave &amp;amp; more unfavourable impression than
            usual : subdued effects evidently are beyond her. M. Maas was dignified and accurate
            throughout. M.M. Gurdin and Chappelon as Vitellius and the High Priest were fair, but
            their voices are thin and not very pleasing. M. Escalais showed, as John the Baptist,
            what he really can do with a part that hardly suits him musically, that is, for his
            acting was most excellent. He, like Mme Baron, had to rely on low notes and subdued
            effects, but unlike her, he was always accurate, and pronounced, and even in his most
            restrained moments his voice had real depth and beauty and distinction standing out amid
            all the rest. He proved himself the fine singer he certainly is, and for merit of
            interpretation and musicianship he and Mme Chaix Bunheur undoubtedly carried off the
            honours : and perhaps on the whole performance we may place M. Mézy next. In the final
            dance-here the opera leaves the tradition entirely, as the head of the prophet is the
            last thing Salomé desires!-Mlle Deliny looked most charming, and really danced
            gracefully. It is a fine opera, and on the whole can be said to have been finely given.

          <p>The members of the chorus of the Khedivial Opera House were convoked yesterday morning
            at the French Consulate in order to receive the remainder of their emoluments. Nearly
            all of them refused to accept what was offered them by M. Poncet, for the reason that
            for the months of December And January they were paid at the rate of 30 days a month,

          <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
          <p>To anyone in search of sudden hot and cold changes, we should recommend the French
            operetta company now playing at the Zizinia Theatre. There is an incompleteness and want
            of stability about their productions which is truly bewildering ; one finds oneself
            applauding and almost simultaneously wondering what there is to applaud. The reason
            probably is that the solog, well enough sung on the whole, are spoilt by a palpably
            untrained chorus and an orchestra lamentably out of time. It is disheartening to think
            that the many and vigorous rehearsals, which are necessary to remedy these defects, are
            probably without the range of possibility for a touring company giving a different
            operetta every night of their week's stay. Therefore we must not be too exacting. All
            the same our pleasure is seriously impaired at hearing Lecocq's and Messager's
            well-known airs given with such a want of swing andaccoracy. This, we have said, applies
            mainly to the chorus, for there is plenty of good material amongst the principals. Mlle
            Delormes sings and acts very vivaciously, at times alınost to excess. Mlles Hilbert and
            GillBerthe and Mme Degoyou are all satisfactory in their way, while Mlle de Kiercour

            to good effect. The former's Florestan in "Véronique" was most successful, while M Moret
            made a decided hit as Seraphin in the same piece. Besides this, there have been given
            "Le Petit Doo," "Le Jour et la Nuit," end "Les Mousquetaires au Couvent." The order of

          <p>The Earl and Countess of Meath are staying at the New Victoria Hotel, Ramleh. They will
            leave Port Said on the 8th proxo., probably by the P. &amp;amp; S.S. Caledonia. ..</p>
          <p>There are surely no more energetic peer or peeress than Lord and Lady Meath, and. Lady
            Meath's generous philanthropy is well-known in Egypt, where she has done much for the
            poor and the blind, especially in Alexandria. Lord Meath is perhaps most keen on open
            spaces-indeed, Lord Rosebery once said, "If Meath had his way, he would pull down the
            whole of London to make a garden of it for its' inhabitants !" He invented Empire Day.;
            is very keen on teaching.the young idea, not only how to shoot, but also how to drill;
            and is the active president of that remarkable organisation, the Church Army. Lord Meath
            was at · Eton as a boy, and he remembers the arrival of the late Empress Frederick and
            her husband at Windsor. He helped to drag her carriage up the Castle hill when he should
            have been otherwise engaged, and this involved a somewhat painful interview with the
            headmaster, the result being that in after years Lord Meath was able to inform her
            Majesty that he had shed his blood for her sake! After leaving Eton he had some glorious
            times in the little Principality of Schaumberg-Lippe, where he went to learn German. In
            company with some | other choice young English spirits, he organised a paperchase; so
            little was this game understood by the natives, that when the field asked. some peasants
            whether they had seen the hare, they replied, "Ah, yes, the thiet has the bouty in a bag
            ; you will catch him over the hill." Next day a policeman came from the Prince of
            Schaumberg-Lippe, his Highness having heard that the boys had been robbed of five
            hundred thalers. Prolonged explanation only drew from thë policeman the remark, "Good
            heavens ! the English are all mad." </p>
          <p>Lady Meath, who is &amp;amp; cousin of Lord Lauderdale's, specialises in rather more
            definitely charitable schemes. Perhaps one of her best ideas is to give the old and
            infirm people in -workhouses something to do. Moreover, when she was Lady Brabuzon she
            started the Ministering Children's League, the members of which are pledged to do at
            least one kind deed every day: Lady Meath also finds time to be an enthusiastic gardener
            at Kilruddery, her husband's beautiful place in Co. Wicklow. A good story, by the way,
            is told of this property. Although Lord · Meath is most generous in throwing it open to
            the public, there are some days in the year on which it has to be closed to preserve the
            private ownership On one of these days an American visitor, finding his way barred, and
            being informed that it was Lord Meath's property, anxiously inquired whether the sea
            also belonged to his ļordship, as he desired to bathe, and yet did not want to trespass. </p>

            act as "one of the most courageous he has ever witnessed." There was a gap in the
            square, and five or six of the enemy, seeing it, rushed forward, | attempting to pierce
            the ranks. Then Captain Wilson advanced to meet them alone, and breaking his sword in
            his effort to cut one of them down, would not retire a step, but held his ground,
            knocking them down with his fists. Either by a miracle or the surprising nature of his
            attack, he escaped with a few wounds, and the square closing up rescued him. He was.

          <head>ARABIC READING BOOK.</head>
          <p>We reviewed not long ago the first volume of this important series of the late Frederi
            Du Pré Thornton's Arabic books of the classical language, edited by Mr. Reynold A
            Nicholson, of which the work now under review is the second volume. While the first part
            dealt with the grammar, which is ar abridgement of Wright's famous work, the author
            gives in the present volume the original Arabic text of suratu'l fatiha, the first
            chapter of the Coran, as well as many verses of euratul a'raf and the whole of saratu'
            agabun, all of which are printed in very clear ype with all the correct vowels, to give
            the reader a fair notion of the style and contents of the Coran, followed by four
            stories of Arab warriors and some historical extracts relating co the Prophet Mohamed,
            such as the asking of Mecca and the death of the Prophet, and various other extracts,
            but smaller type und with less vowels han the suras, all of which are most excellent
            exercises for the student of Arabic, and the jook ends, or rather begins on the left
            side, with a grammatical analysis of the Arabic text of the suras which are extremely
            helpful. n this part the author gives in several columns the transliteration, meaning,
            grammatical analysis, Arabic names of some of the xpressions, the numbers of the
            sections of Ir. Thornton's grammar and the roots of most all the Arabic words. The book
            also contains a glossary (placed between the Arabic ait and the grammatical analysis) to
            the non'organic passages, of great use to the reader as he English translation of this
            part of the book is not given. One fault, however, we find with he analysis. It does not
            give the transliteration, etc., of all the text, but leaves out words and terminations
            which the author evidently considers too well understood to require explanation, while
            in our opinion it would have made that part more complete to have given the whole text.
            The size of the book is very convenient and we strongly recommend it to I those who wish
            to study that beautiful and ch language--classical Arabic. </p>

            distributing the shares privately It is owing to this fact that the company has

          <p>It is interesting to glance at the various items of the last balance sheet. On the
            credit side we note that the properties of the company on the 30th November were valued
            at L.E. 79,866, sundry debtors amounted to L.E. 28,138, the dividends on investments to
            L.E. 4,000, and the general expenses to L.E. 748. On the debit side we find sundry
            creditors for L.E. 1,486. </p>
          <p>On comparing the above figures with those of the preceding balance sheet, we observe
            that Che company acquired, during 1906, new lands to the value of about £26,000 more
            than its Bales, as the item "Properties" in the balance sheet on the 30th Nevember,
            1905, amounted only to L.E. 53,500, whereas it stood, on the Both November last, at L.E.
            79,866. </p>
          <p>The actual properties of the company are:15,846 sq are pics near the Farkha canal, at
            Moharrem Bey.. 7,528 square pics at Karmous, in the native quarter. 8,356 square pics,
            including buildings, front ing the Ramleh road, between Flem ing and Bacos 653 feddang
            at Awada-Baslacoum, near Kafr-el-Dawar, the cost of which is about L.E. 41 $ per feddan
            to-day. The company has sold during 1906 :6,869 square pics, ex-Autofage property, at
            the corner of Sidi-Metwalli and Salah-el-Din streets. 2,854 square pics at San Stefano.
            217 feddans at El-Halafi (Gharbieh). </p>
          <p>5 parcels of the Moharrem-Bey land We think we are right in assuming that the actual
            price (about £5) of the Egyptian Land and Investment Company's shares may be considered
            as an advantageous one, considering the undoubted increase in the price of the company's
            properties acquired, for the greater art, more than two years ago. </p>

          <head>NEW SUEZ CANAL.</head>
          <head>PROPOSAL TO CONSTRUCT A SECO GREAT WATERWAY THROUGH EGYPT</head>
          <p>The London correspondent of the "New York Herald" (Paris) writes : In accordance with
            instructions received from the Chambers of SŁ ping of the United Kingdom, the Parliament
            Committee of that body is urging His Majesty Government to use its influence to bring
            about an adequate representation upon the S Canal Company of all classes of British sb |
            ping which make use of the canal. There is - strong feeling among British shipowners t
            the "Mistress of the Seas" - should also mistress of the Suez Canal. Over four thousand
            vessels pass yearly through the Canal, and annual tonnage is considerably over thirty
            million tons, the British percentage being 68 | While in Parliamentary circles there is
            improvement for a more adequate representation the existing Canal Committee, in circles
            a proposal to make a new canal is receiving influential support. The contention that the
            present canal does not supply Brit requirements, and the shipowners pay highly for
            inadequate accommodation. The maximum draught of water allowed for vessels using the
            canal is 27 feet-insufficient for larger British warships. Its breadth—121 5in.-does not
            allow of very large ships making their way under steam, but needs the service of u gs.
            The canal cost £24,000,000 to construct and enlarge. </p>
        </div>
        <div type="item">
          <head>CHEAPER CONSTRUCTION.</head>
          <p>It has been computed that the construction of a far more commodious water way worthy
            British engineers and England's immense interest in the object would not in these days
            cost as much as the present canal. It is believed that as the public would entertain no
            doubt success when the work was undertaken by eminent British engineers and contractors
            there could be no financial difficulty, nor an necessity of a Government guarantee in
            the days when it is hard to find safe investment for superabundant capital. According to
            one survey already made a better line for part the distance than that of the present can
            might be found, and that is a point which will have to be fully considered. </p>
          <p>No doubt is entertained by those who wish to construct a new waterway, about a Britis
            canal being made to suit British requirement in the present, and England's greater needs
            in the future, and to make a larger return on the capital expended This is proved by the
            existing canal, upon which much money was wasted. The only serious objection arises from
            the fact that the British Government hold £4,000,000 (now valued at £32,000 000 stock of
            the present canal, the value of which would be depreciated by the competition. * </p>

          <p>This is a consideration of some importance but it is contended that it cannot outweigh
            the immense advantages of having communications -with India entirely in British hands.
            In commercial circles in the City and the great shipping ports in the provinces it is
            believed that there would probably be traffic enough for both canals Even among
            shipowners and merchants who are in favour of a new caval, there are those who are
            asking : -"How would the scheme, if adopted, affect the "Entente Cordiale.'" . </p>
          <p>There are those still living who remember the origin and early history of the Suez
            Canal under the days when France, then under the influence of the Napoleonic "legend,"
            was ready co go to war literally with Europe in defence of imaginary rights in Egypt.
            Another generation, however, has sprung up unconscious of those times, and quite unaware
            how irreconcilble were the views of the French politicians of a long bygone day with the
            generally received notions of Englishmen on the subject.. </p>
          <p>When the Crimean · and Franco-Austrian ars had enormously exalted the prestige of
            France, to some extent at the expense of England, a concession was granted M. de Lesseps
            (virtually France) which would have been an intolerable menace and danger to England.
            The original concession was not merely the right to construct the canal, but one possess
            a slice of Egypt commanding the whole course of the canal and which would very soon have
            become French territory. It was 18 &amp;amp; most effectual anti-English measure that M.
            de Lesseps regarded the Suez Canal, "a pear to pierce the armour of England," as he once
            called it. And in that light, according to history, it was received in France, </p>

          <head>MALTA FEVER </head>
          <p>In view of the fact that Malta fever is becoming a not infrequent disease in Egypt, it
            is worth noting that a further report of the commission appointed by the Admiralty, the
            War Office, and the Civil Government of Malta for the investigation of Malta or
            Mediterranean ever has just appeared. In this Staff-Surgeon E. A. Shaw details
            experiments relating to various possible paths of infection by the micro-organism of the
            disease Major W. H. Horrocha supplies a valuable contribution on outbreaks of the fever
            in Gibraltar and the general question of infection by goats. The pinion is expressed
            that the rapid disappear. mice of Mediterranean fever from the Rock, which commenced in
            1885, was intimately Associated with the greatly-lessened important on of goats from
            Malta, At the present time ne goat-keepers introduce Spanish goats, but, the interests
            of the public health, it is held that notwithstanding the healthy conditions now
            prevailing, all goats brought to Gibraltár could be quarantined until examinations of
            the Lord have shown them to be free from infection. </p>

          <p>"My Endorsement of Pe-ru-na is Based on its Merits - Ed Crumbo.</p>
          <p>ED. CRUMBO Ex-Mayor of New Albany, Ind., written from 511 E. Oak street: "My
            endorsement of Peruna is based on its merits. If a man is sick he looks anxiously for
            something which will cure him and Perunaq will do the work. "I know that it will cure
            catarrh of the head or stomach, indigestion, headache and any weary or sick feeling. "It
            is bound to help anyone, if used according to directions. "I also know dozens of men who
            speak in the highest terms of Peruna and have yet to hear of anyone being disappointed
            in it." Mr. Crumbo, in a ;ater letter, dated Aug 25, 1904, says: "My health is good, at
            present, but if I should have to take any more medicine I will fall back on Peruna" </p>
          <p>For special directions everyone would read" The Ills of Life" a copy of which surrounds
            each bottle. Peruna is for sale by all chemists and druggists at five shillings per
            bottle or six bottles for twenty-five shillings. Those wishing direct correspondence
            with Dr. Hartman and can wait to the necessary delay in receiving a reply should address

          <head>BULLETIN DE LA BOURSE</head>
          <p>(Aujourd'hui à midi et demie.) </p>
          <p>La hausse du taux privé d'escompte de 4 7/8 A5%, accompagnée de la baisse du Consolide
            À 85 3/8 et de la rente à 95.92 a de nouveau paralysé notre marché. La plupart des
            grosses valeurs sont délaissées et offertes. En revanche plusieurs nouvelles émissions
            donnent lieu un mouvement plus ou moins 'actif. • De ce nombre sont Arditi, la Levico,
            le Ritz Hôtels, le fondateur Famous. </p>
          <p>Pour cette dernière, les esprits réfléchis sont étonnés qu'elle se tienne à 4 1/2,
            tandis que l'action est au-dessous du pair. Il y a là une inconséquence flagrante : si
            la fondateur vaut ce qu'elle est cotée, l'action doit valoir par le fait même plus que
            le pair. </p>
          <p>La Levico s'avance 19/32, sur la rumeur que le Conseil d'Administration a conclu une
            importante affaire de courtage. </p>
          <p>La fondateur United s'avance à 9 3/8 et les Ritz à 2 8/16. </p>

          <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
          <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
            accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which they may travel
            homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely as
            possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with difficulty. In
            choosing the route home there are several things to be considered. To begin with there
            is the difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you may
            arrive in Europe.</p>
          <cb n="2"/>
          <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January may
            be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March it
            will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many
            people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May
            is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
          <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at sea, and we
            therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of the various routes between
            Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
          <p><cb n="3"/></p>
          <p>They are as follows:—</p>
          <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton, London or
            Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

          <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German Lloyd,
            Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, Bibby and
            Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
            travellers to Egypt.</p>
          <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria, without
            change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change in 4 ½ hours.</p>
          <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
            lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good
            steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
          <cb n="5"/>
          <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express from Port
            Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles and the Austrian
            Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
          <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage is allowed
            free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and responsible forwarding
            agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any address in
            Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have also made arrangements whereby luggage can be
            collected and sent to any address.</p>
          <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast Mail
            Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port Said every week, as
            soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner
            arrived from Bombay.</p>
          <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very
            high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to
            carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
            England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais
            without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you
            should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

          <head>SICILY.</head>
          <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which leave
            Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one of the most
            charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic">Giardini</hi> is the
            station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying
            about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is
            of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the
            ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
            remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE
            has an interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes
            in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is
            to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000
            inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
            interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo Reale</hi> is
            of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli
              Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
            Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="item">
          <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
          <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday during the
            season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
          <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers,
            which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to explore
            some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay—<hi rend="italic"
              >Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes
            you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
          <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at
            least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal
            City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment here.</p>
          <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours brings you
            to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the <hi rend="italic">City of
              Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches and
            galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should
            not be omitted. <hi rend="italic">The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and
            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>,
            one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
            hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside Florence is that
            to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300
            feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi
              rend="italic">St. Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
              >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking
            panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
          <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine Cathedral
            and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if possible be made in order
            to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.</p>
          <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and on
            the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way house between Egypt
            and England, and where living is reasonable and the air and surroundings exceptionally
            good.</p>

          <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with the record
            of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and a phenomenally equable
            temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains
            and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
          <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and
            famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a constant delight to
            thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there are the superbly
            decorated medieval churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical
            paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
          <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
          <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the Lakes. The
            Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows illustrating the
            History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental cemetery are also worth a
            visit.</p>

          <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
          <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most delightful places
            imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as
            very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the
            sound of life at every turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of
            any other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No
            hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
            horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm
            lagoon.</p>
          <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the beautiful
            Italian lakes.</p>
          <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by
            train by way of Monza.</p>
          <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very beautiful,
            and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a
            charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
              >Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town
            of <hi rend="italic">Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic"
              >Tremezzo</hi> along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
            enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
              >Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

          <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half hours. It has
            a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst
            lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M.
            Generoso.</p>
          <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town,
            situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an excellent winter
            resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it
            contains interesting paintings, "Entombment," by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by
            Bramantion.</p>
          <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the
            snow-clad Alps.</p>
          <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made from
            Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">The Lake of Lucerne</hi> abounds in delightful excursions, those to
            the <hi rend="italic">Rigi</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Pilatus</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
              >Burgenstock</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sonnenberg</hi> needing a special visit each.
            Other excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery on
            the trip from <hi rend="italic">Lucerne</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">Fluelen</hi> is a
            source of delight to the lover of nature.</p>
          <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of Lucerne,
            commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the Lake of Uri from
            Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous <hi rend="italic">Axentrasse</hi>.</p>
          <p>THUN (on the Lake of Thun) half an hour from Berne and one hour from Interlaken. Quiet
            and quaint; sheltered from winds; just the place to rest and recuperate. Beautiful
            walks, through woods, and along the lake shore. Kursaal, Concernts, Casino, Races,
            Tennis, Boating, etc.</p>
          <p>THE BERNESE OBERHAND. – INTERLAKEN, a favourite summer resort and the best centre for
            making excursions in the Oberland, abounding in fine walks and views. There is a
            magnificent view of the <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau</hi> from the Hoheweg, a fine avenue
            of walnut trees, the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not far from the

            and <hi rend="italic">Staubbach</hi>. Then also the glaciers of <hi rend="italic"

          <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached from
            Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are those of the
            Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
          <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter in order to
            witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing on
            the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for which a special train is run from
            Athens.</p>
          <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of the scenery.
