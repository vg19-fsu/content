                    <head>The Mediterranean.</head>
                    <p>The announcement of Agreements between Spain and France and between Spain and
                        Great Britain, which was signed last week, for the maintenance of the status
                        quo in certain parts of the Mediterranean and of the Atlantic must be read
                        in connection with its context, the present State of Europe, and of the
                        relations between the Great Powers of the world, is much commented on in
                        Europe. An Agreement for the maintenance of the stains is a mild form of
                        defensive combination. It can hardly by any stretch of the imagination be
                        construed into an offensive design. The first impression which the news
                        makes is that the three States concerned have taken a step which is the
                        outcome of their desire for the preservation of peace or, what is the same
                        thing, for the retention of their rights and territories, and that the
                        Agreements must contribute to bring them into closer relations with one
                        another. The words "closer relations" are a little vague. They deserve to be
                        illustrated, and the best illustration is offered by a consideration of the
                        recent relations between England and France. Since the Agreements between
                        the two countries, negotiated by <persName>Lord Lansdowne</persName>, not
                        only have Englishmen been made to feel more at home in France than before,
                        and, we trust, Frenchmen to feel more at home in England, but the two
                        Governments have been able to co-operate in matters in which a few years ago
                        their cooperation could hardly have been proposed. One example is the joint
                        purchase of the concession for the management of the Quays at
                        Constantinople, and others could be found. Governments thus drawn together
                        can consider in common many things which they might otherwise consider from
                        opposite points of view. In this why causes or occasions of friction are
                        eliminated, with the consequence that the number of possible or probable
                        International disputes is reduced. The new Agreements then tend towards
                        peace, and quiet, and that is again not only to the nations directly
                        concerned but to the world at large. </p>
                    <p>Behind the first impression or foreground of the picture there is a
                        background. Governments do not put their heads together to consolidate the
                        peace unless they feel that there is a possibility of its disturbance. In a
                        settled climate a man does not go out of doors with an umbrella except in
                        the rainy season. The fact that people carry umbrellas points to the climate
                        being uncertain. In the same way the fact that Spain has come to an
                        understanding with France and with England on the subject of the
                        preservation of the "status quo", in regions, where all the three Powers
                        have interests proves that there was a feeling that the International
                        atmosphere was not as calm and settled as it might be. But there is a
                        difference between an umbrella and an International Agreement. The umbrella
                        does not affect the weather ; it is merely a precaution against a shower
                        whereas an Agreement between two or three Powers may help to avert the
                        disturbance against which it is a guarantee, at any rate when its existence
                        is made known to the world. The great originator of International Agreements
                        in recent times was Bismarck, who in a famous speech, delivered nearly a
                        quarter of a century ago, tleacrila,1 the Triple Alliance between Germany,
                        Russia, and Austria as "a strong arch which would avert many storms that
                        might otherwise come." No one in those days took umbrage at Germany's method
                        of making alliances, and when the Triple Alliance of the Three Emperors gave
                        place to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy no Power took
                        offence. The feeling was that Powers had a perfect right to make such
                        arrangements. What made that speech of Bismarck's famous was the
                        insinuations against England with which he poisoned the minds of his country
                        men. It was then that he attributed to England a telegram informing him that
                        certain inhabitants of New Guinea protested against a German protectorate.
                        He suppressed the fact that the telegram was sent by a Russian, and was in
                        no way connected with England or with English influence. From that speech
                        dates the rise in Germany of a sentiment which has since then puzzled and
                        perplexed those Englishmen who loved Germany and tried to understand the
                        German people, and which has annoyed Englishmen who were before
                        in-different. The sentiment consisted in a strong anti-English bias coupled
                        with a vague rootlessness. It takes the shape of comment the reverse of
                        objective upon every action of the British Government in its relations with
                        other Powers. The reader has but to peruse the comments on the new
                        Agreements quoted by our Berlin Correspondent from German papers to have a
                        sample of the sentiment to which we refer. Yet the Agreements cannot on any
                        theory be construed as a menace to any German right or interest They might,
                        indeed, be real as creating a barrier against German designs if such designs
                        existed, for subverting the status quo to the detriment of Great Britain,
                        France, or Spain. If no such design is cherished, then the Agreements have
                        no point against Germany. If they are disagreeable to Germany there must be
                        some German intention which they tend to thwart. But in that case not only
                        are the Agreements necessary, but they ought to be supplemented by such
                        armaments, especially in Great Britain, as would give material weight to the
                        guarantee which they contain. The truth is - at any rate it has always
                        seemed to us to be the truth - that there is no substantial ground for
                        either disagreement or unfriendliness between England and Germany and that
                        without artificial stimulus the irritation that exists would disappear. Such
                        an artificial stimulus seems to us to be contained in a small matter not
                        otherwise worth a reference. Our Berlin Correspondent informs us that he is
                        specially excluded from attendance at entertainments given in Berlin to the
                        Lord Mayor of London. We are not aware of the reason, if any. Possibly there
                        is some resentment at the fact that though we take some pains to be
                        acquainted with German thought and feeling and endeavour to be fair and
                        courteous in such comments as we make upon German policy-we protested
                        against the Morocco Agreement partly on the ground that in form it ignored
                        Germany's right to be consulted-we have preserved our independence and not
                        allowed ourselves to be the medium of utterances inspired by the German
                        Government. </p>
                    <p>We have felt at liberty to refer to the German comments on the new Agreements
                        partly because they seem to us to be hardly based on a full consideration of
                        the facts. For the main fact is not yet known, being no other than the text
                        of the Agreements which is not yet published, though it cannot be long
                        delayed. The Governments concerned are not likely to have notified to the
                        other Powers the existence of Agreements of which the text is to be kept
                        Secret It seems therefore a pity that the German critics should make up
                        their minds as to their object before they have had the opportunity of
                        studying their purport. We note in one of these German articles the
                        expression "A paper ring round Germany." The expression conveys at once an
                        insinuation that any British attempt at friendship with another Power is an
                        unfriendly act towards Germany, and that it is of no avail. But has the
                        writer put to his readers the question whether the German Government has
                        ever during the last few years made any proposal whatever for an
                        understanding with Great Britain, and whether any such proposal has been
                        rejected by a British Government I ("Morning Post"). </p>

                    <head>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</head>
                    <p>Sir,— About the beginning of last April there appeared a notice in the
                        "Egyptian Gazette" from the Managing Director of the Egyptian Estates
                        limited regarding the delay in issuing the yearly report. As far as I
                        recollect he stated "that there would be a short delay as the books wore not
                        closed owing to serrerai large business transactions having lately taken
                        place." He, however, added that a dividend would be declared This was nearly
                        three months ago and since then there has been silence. For investors like
                        myself, who purchased shares in this company as an investment giving a
                        reasonable return of interest, these dilatory methods of company management
                        are unsatisfactory and can hardly tend to inspire the confidence of the
                        investing (not speculating) public in Egyptian Companies.</p>

                    <p>The gross earnings at the Egyptian Delta Light Railways Limited during the
                        year ending the 31st March last, amounted to about £250,000. This left the
                        net earnings at £100,000, which is about £10,000, or over one and a half per
                        cent on the capital better than the previous year's results. A better
                        dividend may therefore be expected. The annual general meeting will be held
                        in the course of next month.</p>
                    <p>Since the close of this company's financial year the gross receipts ure up to
                        the date of the last return, which appeared in our issue of Saturday last,
                        no less than twenty four per cent higher than during the corresponding
                        period of the previous year. This is a remarkable proof of the general
                        well-being of the country and shows that the fellaheen were never in a more
                        prosperous condition.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir, In Alexandria a great work has been undertaken, viz., the quays.
                            Like Rome it could not be built in a day, but is that a reason why the
                            Municipality should not see that the roads along anti leading to the
                            quays are not watered. We won't speak of the "dirt" that people have to
                            trample into sometimes in going along this mail</p>
                        <p>Every dog has his day : why should not the boyagis have theirs, once the
                            Municipality gives them the chance of making money. At least, before the
                            quays were thought of one could go for a little fresh air to the
                            sea-shore, and come back with clean shoes ; now it is an impossibility :
                            one's shoes must be dirtied — that's where the boyagis come in. The road
                            leading from Nebi Daniel Street to the quays, behind our old consulate,
                            is a simple disgrace. I think it is a shame that the Municipality should
                            have to be repeatedly told what it has to do. Now supposing even they do
                            water the rood, I am sure they will do so in the afternoon as they do in
                            town (when they give themselves this trouble !) converting the road way
                            into an "Egyptian" bog.</p>
                        <p>I am, Sir,</p>
                        <p>Yours truly,</p>

                        <p>Messrs. Russell, Kerr and Wyatt are busily engaged ou the investigation
                            of the accounts of both Alexandria and Cairo branches of the bank. This
                            firm is employing a considerable staff for the purpose and is doing its
                            utmost to got out the accounts as soon as passible. The work will take
                            some days.</p>
                        <p>According to a private telegram from London the Cassa's prospects of
                            settlement are considered favourable.</p>
                        <p>It is rumoured in regard to the future that a new hank may be formed
                            with, say, a capital of £400,000 and the shares would be offered to the
                            present shareholders of the Cassa. The issue would be guaranteed by Sir
                            Ernest tassel's group and the Union Bank. The new bank would continue
                            the Cassa's business by taking over all the good assets and slowly
                            liquidating the had ones.</p>

                        <p>In a recent issue we discussed the position of the Bourse ami Banking Co.
                            whose affairs were then the subject of much comment in this city, and we
                            felt ourselves compelled to make some animadversions on the manner in
                            which their business has been conducted ami we also considered tho
                            liabilities of its directors, although we in no way impugned their good
                            faith.At the same time we gave publicity to what we considered a bizarre
                            scheme for the settlement of their liabilities as principals or agents
                            dealing in their own shares on the Bourse.</p>
                        <p>A memorandum of an agreement has, we understand, been circulated among
                            the brokers of the Bourse with the object of obtaining their sanction to
                            a settlement on the basis we then foreshadowed. We have no wish to
                            question the action of the promoters of this arrangement, which has been
                            promulgated with an honest endeavor for the solution of a great
                            difficulty in a period of exceptional emergency, as well as by a feeling
                            of solidarity for fellow members ; and we hope that where the proposal
                            is reciprocally acceptable the scheme may be successful.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, in view of the expression of opinion we have heard in
                            some quarters, we feel constrained to express ourselves that the
                            arrangement cannot be compulsorily enforced against any dissentient. It
                            seems to as that contracts for shares sold subject to the rules and
                            regulations of the Bourse, 1st August 1892, are binding between brokers
                            and clients. No rules of the Bourse can be made retrospective. Those
                            shareholders, therefore, who took advantage of the market and disguised
                            their holdings cannot now have their contracts anulled or vitiated. They
                            can insist on full payment in exchange for their shares, which they are
                            entitled to receive from the company on the production of proper
                            receipts.</p>

                        <p>Writing on the losses of the Union Bank of Vienna as resulting from the
                            Egyptian financial crisis, the "New Freie Presse," the leading Viennese
                            newspaper, says :—</p>
                        <p>Owing to the financial crisis in Egypt on the cause ami development of
                            which we have several times reported, the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio
                            lias also got into difficulties. The Union Rink which represents the
                            Austrian banking connection of this establishment granted the latter, a
                            Linking credit of four million francs ; the greater part of which will
                            presumably result in a loss. The Union Bank gives the following
                            communication on this subject :</p>
                        <p>"A credit of four million francs is granted by the Union Bank to the
                            Alexandria establishment. The claims of the Union Bank, ensuing
                            therefrom are, however, entirely covered by commercial bills. These are
                            constantly inspected by a resident delegate of the Union Bank. The Union
                            Bank has realized, within a small balance, the shares of the Cassa di
                            Sconto e di Risparmio and has placed the profits thus obtained in
                            reserve."</p>
                        <p>The following supplementary information lias been received :</p>
                        <p>Tho Cassa di Sconto o di Risparmio was established in 1885. In the year
                            1906 the Union Bank connected business with it. This connection was of a
                            twofold nature. A credit of four millions of francs was granted and
                            besides the Union Bank had repeatedly acquired part of the shares at
                            every increase of capital ; it was also represented by three delegates
                            of the Board of Directors of the Cassa.</p>
                        <p>The original capital of tho Cassa was small and only consisted of five
                            million francs when the Union Bank entered into connection with it. The
                            capital had then been increased to ten million francs. The Union Bank
                            acquired on behalf of a syndicate with which it was associated, 30,000
                            new shares, which were realised during the past year.</p>
                        <p>A new increase of capital was undertaken fins year which, however, has
                            not yet been fully carried out The claims of the Union Bank on the Cassa
                            di Sconto e di Risparmio amount as stated to four millions of francs.
                            This is a banking debt which is covered by bills. These bills are
                            deposited in a special dossier in the name of the Union Bank ami are
                            kept in evidence and controlled there by the representative of the Union
                            Bank, residing in Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>The crisis ini Egypt, however, will cause the non-payment of Some of
                            these bills. The losses which these bills will cause cannot be estimated
                            yet ami it is yet quite uncertain whether and in what manner the Cassa
                            will be subject to reconstruction. It is expected, however that part of
                            the credit granted by the Union Bank to the Cassa di Sconto e di
                            Risparmio will prove a loss, as it is very improbable that considering
                            the actual heavy crisis in Egypt, the Cassa will be able to square at
                            once its losses on bills through the realization of other assets. </p>
                        <p>The great business extension of the Classa was rendered possible through
                            the increase of capital of this year. Up to now the capital of the Cassa
                            amounted to 10 million francs and, through issuing 50,000 shares at 100
                            francs nominal value, it was raised to 15 million francs. The shares
                            were issued at the rate of 150 percent. Up to the present, however, the
                            premium of 50 francs alone has been paid in, and the sum of 5 million
                            francs is still outstanding. The Union Bank still possesses in all 1,500
                            shares of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio of which 1,000 are fully
                            paid ami on 500 the premium alone has been paid.</p>
                        <p>It has not, however, included in its balance-sheet the total profits
                            realized on the shares acquired in 1906.</p>
                        <p>It takes it for granted that a profit of K. 984.000 will remain, even if
                            the shares which are in its possession should totally decline in value.
                            This profit could then serve to make up for the loss of the
                            above-mentioned credit and would oven suffice if these losses were equal
                            to one fourth of this credit.</p>
                        <p>Whether this sum will really be found sufficient, is for the present a
                            matter of opinion. The crisis of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio come
                            with surprising suddenness. In the reports of the Union Bank it is
                            intimated that the upmost care was taken when transacting business. Last
                            year the shares of this Bank had reached their highest value at 280 per
                            cent. The day before yesterday they were still quoted above par. Whereas
                            yesterday they fell to 100 per cent vendors. Last year's dividend
                            amounted to 14%. The last report which was submitted at die last general
                            meeting of the Cassa held on the 17th March speaks with great confidence
                            of this year' business prospects. The last balance sheet showed a net
                            profit of 6.6. million Egyptian piastres or approximately 1.4. million
                            franca According to the last balance-sheet the share-capital amounted to
                            10 million Tram's, to which must be added the reserves of 2.5. million
                            francs. The premium on shares brought in another 2.5. million francs, so
                            that its own means also amount to 15 million francs. On the other hand
                            the liabilities as per balance-sheet of 31st December reach 68 million
                            francs and then surely cannot have diminished of late as the business
                            had been considerably extended. Among the liabilities figure deposits of
                            12 million francs and creditor accounts of 31 million francs. According
                            to the last balance-sheet die Bank owns bills to the extent of 13
                            million francs, further current-account credits of 16 million franca
                            Besides this, the balance sheet shows a very large sum involved in bills
                            viz: advances against bills for 21 million francs and against stocks and
                            shares for A million francs. It depends entirely on the further
                            development ami state of the Egyptian crisis whether or not tho
                            liquidation of these assets be possible. The stringency for gold in
                            Egypt is, according to all reports, very severely felt and the reaction,
                            especially at the Cairo and Alexandria Bourses, a very serious one. In
                            the administration of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio there figure as
                            representatives of the Union Bank Mr. Georg V. Metaxa, the sub-manager
                            of the Trieste branch, Mr.Giacomo von Rimini and the Agent of the
                            Assicurazioni Generali of Alexandria, Mr. Adolf Stross.</p>
                        <p>The news of the difficulties of the Cassa di Sconto e di Risparmio
                            brought about to-day a rather strong reaction of the Union Bank's
                            shares. They were quoted yesterday 549 and fell to-day before the
                            official opening of the Bourse to 538. later on however, they rose to

                        <p>The protest of some intelligent Egyptians against the effects of the
                            Nationalist agitation on the financial crisis is the subject of the
                            following comments by "Al Watan" :—</p>
                        <p>Seeing the impasse into which our finances had been brought by the
                            sustained misrepresentation and agitation of the Nationalist party, and
                            fearing a greater trouble ahead, certain members of the Legislative
                            Council and notables have invited the cream of Egyptian manhood to a
                            meeting at which the present situation was discussed, and a decision of
                            the most remarkable nature was arrived at. The representative notables
                            and authorities have emphatically and clearly repudiated every sort of
                            Nationalist teaching ami declared that the people are neither averse to
                            the present regime nor hostile to foreigners in this country. On the
                            contrary, Egyptians of all shades and creeds are avowed friends of their
                            present Government ami apply for no fundamental change in its
                            constitution. The nation L grateful for the reform and security ensured
                            under the present regime. It favors no hatred to foreigners or Europeans
                            and is utterly disgusted with the detestable agitation which has
                            destroyed Europe's confidence in Egypt and brought about the present
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>The action of these representative Egyptians has marked a new departure
                            in the history of our political parties. It has been a thunderbolt to
                            the enemies of justice, but a mild dew to the soul of the peace-loving
                            Egyptians of whom a considerable number had followed the agitators on
                            the high road to ruin. We mention the action of these intelligent
                            notables with pleasure and pride and see in it a great victory for the
                            cause of truth and reform.</p>

                    <p>The "Standard" states that it is believed that the Government intend to offer
                        Lord Cromer a grant of £50,000. The delay in the recognition of Lord
                        Cromer's services is due to the fact that he is undergoing special medical
                        treatment with a view to the complete restoration of his health, which is
                        now practically accomplished. I believe that the presentation of a public
                        testimonial will not be delayed much longer.</p>

                        <p>A reduction, to come into force on the 15th instant, has been made in tho
                            rates for the inland postage of parcels. The new rates are, for a parcel
                            not exceeding 3 lbs. 2cp., exceeding 3 lbs. but not exceeding 7 lbs.
                            4cp., and for parcels of over 7 lbs. but not exceeding 1l lbs. 6cp.</p>
                        <p>A new order has also been issued regulating the payment for compensation
                            for loss or damage of parcels posted in Cyprus for conveyance to Egypt,
                            or to the specified countries served through the intermediary of the
                            Egyptian Post Office.</p>
                        <p>Parcels addressed to such places may be insured at rates varying from
                            4cp. to 8cp., for even- £12, but not exceeding a total insurance of £50.
                            The rates for parcels to Egypt is 4cp. for every £12 incurred.</p>
                        <p>Insured parcels, moreover, bave to be specially sealed by the sender, a
                            facsimile of the seal being also affixed to the Customs' declaration and
                            the value of the contents must be inscribed in francs and centimes.
                            These new regulations are, doubtless, due to the recent defalcations at
                            the local Post Office.</p>

                        Newcastle absolutely refused to see faces in Egypt not recommended by his
                        Egyptian mentor. Surely it is natural to predict that our impulsive
                        compatriot will come back to Egypt as ignorant of the country he visited as
                        Mr. Robertson was when be went back to England after his one-sided and queer

                            <p>M. Albert received an ovation at Narbonne and Argelliers where he
                                communicated to the Committee M. Clemenceau's proposals to liberate
                                the prisoners, withdraw the troops, and help viticulture if the
                                agitators reverted to legal methods. The Committee, in view of the
                                vagueness of the Premier's promises, decided to continue the
                                agitation. (Reuter)</p>

                                resolution has been adjourned Mr. Balfour said that the Government
                                was determined to pick a quarrel with the Lords with a view to
                                reviving its waning popularity. He predicted that an appeal to the

                        played the E.T.C., resulting in a splendid victory for the latter, by 194
                        runs.</p>
                    <p>A. N. Prosser was in very good bowling form, taking ti wicket's for 29 runs.
                        W. Hay, was exceedingly unlucky, because, although bowling well, had four
                        catches lost by different fielders.</p>
                    <p>For the batting, Prosser's name must come to the front again, for he was
                        simply knocking them all over the place, finally being stumped by P.
                        Cornish, after having made 149 runs.</p>
                    <p>H- G. Price, with his graceful way of playing knocked up a very valuable
                        addition to the score of 55. Let us hope the E.T.C. will continue, as it has
                        begun the season, as so far, we have not had to report a "loss."</p>

                    <p>A. C. C. v VICTORIA COLLEUR</p>
                    <p>Played on Saturday last. This proved a very interesting and exciting match.
                        The college team was composed of five masters and six boys. Their score, of
                        141, was chiefly made up by the united efforts of the master, A. Mustard
                        taking 44 as top score, but Verney and Curiel, of the boys also contributed
                        useful innings. The Chili fielding was rather slack. To A. Mustard's bowling
                        the A. C. C. wickets fell fast, only H. B. Carver, Mainprice and Price
                        making any resistance. The College fielding was very good and keen, with the
                        exception of McLean being dropped in the long field, which probably cost
                        them the match as when the last wicket fell the club had only just won by 5
                        runs.</p>

                    <head>FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER. Pin k Pills Cured When All Other Remedies Had
                        Failed</head>
                    <p>Signor Joseph Bachelli, of Ponte Chiasso, Como, Italy, in a letter describing
                        how he was cured by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, terminates his letter with
                        this important remark: "I was ill for fourteen years." It is certainly
                        difficult to believe that a man, indifferent though he may be to pain, would
                        wait fourteen years before seeking a remedy capable of curing ailments which
                        made his life a misery. But it is only just to say that Signor Bachelli did
                        all he could to cure himself, but unfortunately, in spite of all the
                        medicines he took, he was not able to find one which did him any good. But
                        Pink Pills restored him to health.</p>
                    <p>"Dr. Williams' Pink Pills," he writes, "have given me every satisfaction, as
                        at present I am not tortured with the ailments which made me sutler so long.
                        My only regret is that I did not take this wonderful medicine at the
                        commencement of my illness. I began to suffer immediately after I contracted
                        malarial fever, which left me ill and very weak and bad state of health. I
                        am certain that the malarial germs remained in my system, as I constantly
                        suffered from headache, pains in the joints, giddiness, and neuralgia. In
                        addition I lost my appetite, and I became melancholy owing to weakness. But
                        a course of Pink Pills restored me to health; - and I cannot find words to
                        express how much I am indebted to them. I feel quite rejuvenated. I wish to
                        add that I was ill for fourteen years."</p>
                    <p>This remark, which is referred to above leads to the conclusion, so often
                        justified, that Pink Pills cure when all other remedies have failed. But it
                        is easy to understand the case of Signor Bacchelli. Like most epidemical
                        illnesses, malaria results in an imperfection in the formation of the blood,
                        a kind of empoisonment. It is for this reason that the convalescence of
                        people who are stricken with epidemical ailments is so long when the
                        necessary remedy has not been taken.</p>
                    <p>Signor Bachelli took certain medicines in order to cure his loss of appetite,
                        headaches, and neuralgia, but before purchasing Pink Pills he did not take a
                        medicament which could purify and enrich the blood.</p>
                    <p>By not doing so he made a grave mistake. His ill state of health was owing to
                        the bad condition of his blood. Pink Pills acted at once upon his blood,
                        purified and strengthened it, and destroyed the cause of his illness. Thus
                        Signor Bacchelli, after fourteen years of suffering, was surprised to find
                        himself cured in a few days.</p>
                    <p>For all illnesses which result from impoverished blood or general weakness of
                        the nervous system one should never hesitate to take Pink Pills. These
                        ailments are numerous: anemia, chlorosis, stomach troubles, weakness,
                        rheumatism, being all caused by bad blood. Neurasthenia, neuralgia, St.
                        Vitus's dance and sciatica all spring from a weak nervous system. </p>

                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM. The New Danger To Philae.</head>
                    <p>For the hundreds of miles from Cairo to Assouan the scenery of the Nile is
                        somewhat monotonous. Hour by hour and day by day as one's boat makes its way
                        southwards there is tin* same unvarying view the yellowish white mud walled
                        villages along the river's edge, the fringe of palms, the green bolt of
                        fields now narrowed as the hills close in, now expanding into a level plain
                        some miles broad, and. beyond, the reddish grey terraced hills of the
                        desert, for the most part too low and too featureless to add dignity to the
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>But when the region of the cataracts is reached, and the Nile roars down
                        between bold ridges and scattered islands and foams over half sunken ledges,
                        and the hills break into peak and precipice, one sees at last really
                        beautiful river scenery. At the First Cataract the great dam of Assouan has
                        utterly changed the landscape and made a wide spreading reservoir the chief
                        feature of what was, a few years ago, a wild scene of rocks and rapids. But
                        if one leaves the track of the tourist, there is many a beautiful bit of
                        river scenery a little farther south on the seventy miles of cataracts
                        between Semneh and Dal, where the Nile breaks its way through the rugged
                        wilderness of the Batn-el-Hagar desert, spots seldom seen by the traveller
                        row that the Sirdar's railway has diverted the route from the old riverside
                        caravan track.</p>
                    <p>The fame of Philae's beauty in old days came no doubt partly from the
                        contrast between its wild surroundings, and this monotonous character of the
                        sluggish river below the cataracts. But there is another contrast that makes
                        it a delight to the traveller who has any artistic insight. Massive, almost
                        brutal, strength is the salient characteristic of the temples of the lower
                        Nile. But those of Philae were built under the Greek rulers of Egypt, and in
                        later Roman imperial days when the Greek was still the chief
                        artist-craftsmen of the land. Here the architect was not content to make
                        mere Titanic bulk and strength the leading feature of his work, as in the
                        towered gateways and pillared halls of Karnak. But he brought to his task
                        the Greek sense of balanced proportion and added a charm of detail, of which
                        the earlier builders of Egypt had no idea.</p>
                    <p>But there is no need to dwell on the beauty of these Greco-Egyptian temples,
                        with their wonderful setting of rock and river. The world acknowledged that
                        the Philae of old days was the gem of the Nile. And when the construction of
                        the Assouan dam was first proposed, and the plans showed a barrier of such a
                        height that the whole of Philae would be buried under the waters of the lake
                        above it, there were protests from the artists and art lovers of every
                        civilized land. In the front of the movement here in England was the late
                        Sir Frederic Leighton who went so far as to say that any tampering with
                        Philae would be a lasting blot on the British occupation of Egypt."</p>
                    <p>It was suggested that the dam might be placed a few miles higher up so as to
                        close the gorge where the Nile runs between the cliffs of the pass of
                        Kalabsheh. But the engineers objected that there they could not get the
                        secure foundation for their work afforded in the mass of syenitic granite
                        through which the river cuts its way at Assouan. The protest of the art
                        world was not, however, without result. The original project had been that
                        the dam should be raised to the height of 118 metres (387 feet) above the
                        low water level at the front of the cataract. The engineers and promoters of
                        the scheme consented to reduce this height to 106 metres (347 feet). With
                        this modification, instead of the temples being drowned in the Hood, the
                        highest level of the reservoir would (they said) inundate only part of the
                        island, and the artists were assured that the temples would be safe enough.
                        Some enthusiast for the project even protested that they would look all the
                        more beautiful standing in the midst of a lake level with their base. That
                        the Egyptian Works Department was not quite so sure about the future of
                        Philae is shown by the fact that before a stroke of work was done on the
                        damn an elaborate survey was made of the island, and a series of wonderful
                        plans and large-scale photographs of every detail of the temples was
                        prepared. This beautiful collection was presented to all the great libraries
                        of the world, as a record for the future. There surely was a lurking
                        feeling, that Philae was in serious peril.</p>
                    <p>The chief danger arose from the fact that the island is not a solid granite
                        crag, but a mass of huge boulders resting on the granite bed of the Nile
                        below. The Ptolemies and the Romans built up massive retaining walls to bold
                        it together, and the infiltration of Nile mud has supplied the soil for the
                        palms that added to the beauty of the buildings. Mud of the upper surface of
                        the island is made ground. And experts say that the strength of the whole
                        composite mass must sooner or later be sapped by the action of the water
                        that stands permanently so high around it. But the damage has been done
                        already. For five months of the year, when the water level is highest, the
                        great temple of Isis and the beautiful roofless unfinished temple known as
                        the "kiosk" or "Pharaoh's bed," are partly inundated, and when the water
                        lolls the lower part of their walls and pillars is covered with a filthy
                        coating of green mud. The foundations are already injured, and here and
                        there wooden preps and shores have been put in—a further disfigurement And
                        now the engineers and the financiers have asked to be allowed to take back
                        part of what they conceded a few years ago. They then cut 12 metres off
                        their predicted dam The Government has now agreed to their folding Imli of
                        this to the existing barrier. It is to be raised six metres, nearly twenty
                        feet, and for a great part of the year Philae will be under water, with only
                        the upper part of its towered gateways rising from the surface of the
                        reservoir.</p>
                    <p>The matter has been decided. Egypt wants more water, in order that the
                        irrigated area may be extended and the revenue increased. There will be a
                        gain of millions in return for the million and a half sterling that the
                        additional work will cost. It is too late for protest. But is it too late
                        for plea that something should yet be done to save the temples?</p>
                    <p>When the Assouan dam was first decided upon, several projects for the
                        preservation of the architectural beauties of Philae were proposed. Dr.
                        Wallis Budge, the Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British
                        Museum, has suggested that the buildings should be removed stone by stone,
                        and rebuilt on one of the bills that look down on the river. The cost would
                        be about £50,OO0, a trifling sum compared with the millions that Egypt gains
                        by the reservoir. The chief objection is that planed thus on the mainland
                        the buildings would lose all the added charm of their old position in the
                        midst of the Nile Another proposal was that they should be transferred to
                        the neighboring island of Bigeh. But though I have no map by me that gives
                        the levels I am inclined to think that Bigeh also will be permanently under
                        water. A third plan, at once the best and the most glaring, was that
                        suggested by the late Sir Benjamin Baker, who gave his great authority for
                        its feasibility. He said that the cost of about £200,000 the temples could
                        be taken down, their foundations made good and raised above the highest
                        water level, and then they could be rebuilt on the new platform thus
                        provided.</p>
                    <p>Might not this suggestion be now considered? It would have been easier work a
                        few years ago, and would probably be somewhat more costly now. The restored
                        group of temples would not indeed be the old Philae, but standing on the
                        raised site in the midst of the waters they would preserve most of its
                        traditional beauties for future ages, and tell the men of those days that
                        our own was not entirely one of vandal utilitarianism. But even from the
                        utilitarian point of view the project is worth consideration. The land of
                        the Nile draws some of its wealth from the annual influx of tourists and the
                        preservation of Philae would mean the retention of a valuable source of
                        income for the Assouan district. Considering how freely money is spent in
                        removing the remains of antiquity to distant museums, and the lavish cost of
                        such operations as placing huge obelisks from Egypt in position on the
                        Thames Embankment, in Central Park, New York, and in the Place de la
                        Concorde, at Paris, the money could certainly be found for placing the
                        temples of Philae some thirty or forty feet or even more - above the level
                        where they now stand. The engineers would have an additional inducement to
                        do the work in the fact that if the temples were raised they might be
                        allowed also to raise their dam, not half-way, but quite up to the level
                        they first promised, with an additional gain to the revenues of Egypt. (Pall

                    <byline>By Sir Walter Meville, K.C.M.G.</byline>
                    <p>"Britain's interests in Egypt are vital," was the closing phrase of my recent
                        article headed "Egypt—the Nation's Trout," and my present purpose is to set
                        forth some of the weighty considerations justifying the adjective vital,
                        foremost among which is Egypt's politico-geographical position. Great
                        Britain is above and before all a naval power, and without an up-to-date and
                        thoroughly efficient navy, British commerce would be at the mercy of any
                        bellicose rival. Does the Government sufficiently consider this when
                        callously cutting down the warship building programme? Through Egypt runs
                        the Suez Canal, the international maritime highway connecting Europe with
                        Asia, and to England the practical hold on this waterway of nations which
                        the occupation of Egypt affords her is of vastly greater importance than it
                        would be to any Power other than the Mistress of India. A cursory glance at
                        a world-map clearly demonstrates the value of Egypt as a strategic base, a
                        base unrivaled while in the hands of a seafaring nation having interests and
                        possessions (such as Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus) in the Mediterranean,
                        besides vast dependencies in the Far East And though our occupation of Egypt
                        does not today, as it might have been held to do in earlier times, give us
                        entire command of the Mediterranean, it does, assuredly, conduce effectually
                        to the preservation in that Inland Sea of the balance of power. Our position
                        in Egypt helps also materially to consolidate our Empire by completing the
                        chain of strategic bases, and it must not be forgotten that this advantage
                        tends to gain in importance as means of communication increase in
                        rapidity.</p>
                    <p>Half-way Station.</p>
                    <p>In addition to being a most useful half-way station for our sea-borne
                        commerce with the East, Egypt, from its unique position, naturally draws
                        other ports important direct and transit trade. Let us, therefore, very
                        shortly consider Britain's commercial interests in that country. In round
                        numbers we may place at £48.000.000 the total volume of Egypt's foreign
                        trade—this total, as regards the value of exports and imports, being in 1906
                        almost equally divided and it is sufficient for our present purpose to state
                        that one half of the exports were taken by the United Kingdom and our
                        Colonies, while a third of Egypt's imports came from various parts of the
                        British Empire</p>
                    <p>To this statement of facts need only be added that the Powers coming after us
                        in Egypt's table of exports and imports were, in sporting parlance, "very
                        bad seconds," and then enough had been said to clearly show how paramount
                        are our trade interests. As distinct from the volume of trade, and yet
                        intimately connected with this phase of our stake in Egypt, is the question
                        of invested capital which, if one takes the trouble to study the list of
                        British banks and limited liability companies, will be seen to reach a
                        colossal sum even if the amount of the Egyptian Debt held in this
                        country—certainly many millions —be left out of the calculation.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as the present and future prosperity of many of the British
                        companies in Egypt depends to a large extent on the value of agricultural
                        land, a little information on this print may be welcomed. I am understanding
                        the case when I say that in the last seven years, lands in this category
                        have doubled in value, and that this astonishing increase is not fictitious
                        or speculative, but is due, almost entirely, to the improvement brought
                        about by British administrators.</p>
                    <p>Cotton and Money.</p>
                    <p>Formerly the Egyptian farmer dare not risk sowing more than one third of his
                        land with cotton Egypt's staple and most remunerative crop—for he could
                        never safely reckon on a Sufficiency of summer water, but to-day inproved
                        irrigation justified him in planting with cotton one hall of his land, i.e.,
                        an acreage 31 per cent, greater than before. Then the more scientific
                        fanning taught him has resulted in a largely increased yield per acre : the
                        land-tax has been reduced and more equitably assessed; a stubborn fight is
                        being made against the cotton worm pest, while improved sanitation and
                        greater general prosperity have accelerated the growth of the population and
                        so increased the supply of field labor.</p>
                    <p>There is another reason a reason of much greater import—why the maintenance
                        of our sway in Egypt is momentous, viz: — That England and Egypt jointly own
                        the Sudan, that vast though but sparsely populated, territory stretching
                        more than a thousand miles both in length and breadth, and over which, on
                        land and water, the Union Jack floats side by side with the Khedive's
                        flag.</p>
                    <p>The Power that holds the Sudan controls the sources of the Nile, the mighty
                        fertilizer of Egypt and it is perfectly plain to all but little Englanders
                        that the Power possessing the Sudan would commit a suicidal act were she to
                        cease to occupy Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Has not enough been said to bring home, even to the most apathetic, the vital
                        nature of Britain's stake in Egypt I Have not proved up to the hilt the
                        contention that the great B.P. irrespective of party politics must never
                        allow his Majesty's Ministers to shilly-shally in their Egyptian policy? And
                        will not every loyal Britisher cast his vote against the Party who would
                        willingly betray the trust Lord Cromer has bequeathed to the nation?</p>

                    <head>THE ARAB HORSE IN AMERICA. An Artist's Hobby.</head>
                    <p>Homer Davenport, whose cartoons have largely formed the popular imagination
                        of Trust', and Tammany, and the Tiger, has gone back to an early love.
                        Nowadays his pen in black and white sketches is busy with the horse. In a
                        crusade against the tortures of the bearing rein, tight harness for
                        unnatural effect, and short cropped tails he is wielding an effective weapon
                        against the cruelties of fashion. Artists may be allowed a hobby Mr.
                        Davenport's is the Arab horse. He looks for the development of the native
                        American mustang by a cross with the puns Arabian strain into an ideal
                        American breed. He has the satisfaction of having established - after the
                        lapse of fifty years—the second stud of Arab horses in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>These were imported by himself last year, after a journey to the Arabian
                        Desert. On the wooden walls of the cue-story bungalow looking farm-house at
                        Morris plains. New Jersey, where Mr. Davenport has made his country abode,
                        is scribbled a pencil inscription: "Oct. 7, 1906. Reached home with 27 head
                        (17 stallions 10 mares), coming direct from the great Anezah tribe. It was
                        the realization of a boy's dream when I saw the Maneghi Sbeyel, the pride of
                        all the Desert, enter these gates."</p>
                    <p>Fourteen years ago the Sultan of Turkey permitted several head of Arab horses
                        and mates to be brought to the Chicago Exposition. Nine of these were burnt
                        to death by their Syrian owners through a religions feud, the rest being
                        dispersed among private purchasers. By diligent search Mr. Davenport has
                        succeeded in acquiring and regathering in his stud all the surviving stock
                        of the 1893 importation with the exception of one mare, whose original
                        purchaser still owns her.</p>
                    <p>THE JOURNEY To THE DESERT</p>
                    <p>The destruction of authentic pedigrees, which in the eyes of Arabians would
                        place them under a ban, determined Mr. Davenport to attempt the difficult
                        task of obtaining from the pure desert stock pedigree animals whose lineage
                        none could invalidate. An application to Washington through tho President's
                        personal support was remarkably and unexpectedly sucessful at
                        Constantantinople, and, armed with the Sultan's irade, Mr. Davenport and the
                        two friends accompanying him carried out their quest last summer</p>
                    <p>"Several of the animals had been put to severe tests of endurance while we
                        were in the desert," said Mr Davenport to me, "and I was so convinced of the
                        endurance and staying powers of the Arabian that the idea occurred to me of
                        having one of my horses which I had sent to Oregon ridden across the
                        American Continent, more than 3,000 miles. When this was mentioned to
                        President Roosevelt, he caught up the matter at once as affording an
                        opportunity for making an army cavalry experimental ride, and through the
                        War Department Lieutenant McCabe, of the 6th Cavalry, was sent to make the
                        ride from Portland, Oregon, to New York. He will ride my Arabian stallion
                        Nejdran, and have relays of army horses along the route. He will take
                        comparative data of the horse's powers, condition, and food, and of the
                        distances covered and halting-places, keeping careful records of his own
                        weight. About 145 days has been estimated by a good horseman as the time it
                        will take, but it may be much less.</p>
                    <p>"As to the endurance of the Arabian, I have a letter from Lord Roberts
                        describing the lifelong companionship of his favorite white charger, which
                        bore him through the Afghan War and other campaigns, and died at the age of
                        twenty-six, having had scarcely a day's ailment in his life. You may
                        remember the horse was a conspicuous figure in the Jubilee Procession.</p>
                    <p>"I do not think that any one will doubt the purity of the Arab stock I
                        brought from the desert. The tribesmen will not use any horse for breeding
                        purposes unless the pedigree is duly authenticated by the seals of the
                        Sheikhs. Where the seal is lost, the horse is discarded, and is no longer
                        reckoned to belong to the 'tehubi' class, the pure breeding stock."</p>

                        <p>In connection with the proposed appointment of a Commander-in-Chief of
                            the land forces in the Mediterranean garrisons and Egypt, the Army
                            Council has under consideration the question of where his head quarters
                            will be located, and this is a question in which much difference of
                            opinion exists in service circles. Malta is the most central point,
                            being practically half ways between Gibraltar and Egypt. But is pointed
                            out that it is too circumscribed and isolated, and the presence of the
                            Commander-in-Chief would more or loss overshadow the commander of the
                            troop in Malta. Egypt is therefore looked upon as the more suitable
                            place, for it could be made the headquarters of a division which would
                            form a connecting link between England, Gibraltar, Malta and India. In
                            event of war in India, or its borders, an Egyptian division would come

                    <head>Stomach Indigestion. Peruna Strikes at the Root of the Trouble</head>
                    <p>Mr. S.J. Massey, formerly a resident of Toronto, and a well-known business
                        man, writes from 247 Guy street, Montreal, Quebec: </p>
                    <p>"I wish to testify to the good results I have derived from the use of
                        Peruna."</p>
                    <p>"Having been troubled for several years with catarrh of the head, I decided
                        to give Peruna a fair trial and I can truly say I have received great
                        benefits from its use."</p>
                    <p>"It evidently strikes at the very root of the trouble and good results are
                        soon noticeable."</p>
                    <p>"I have also found Peruna a very valuable remedy for stomach trouble and
                        indigestion."</p>
                    <p>I have no hesitancy whatever in recommending Peruna as a reliable catarrh
                        remedy."</p>
                    <p>There are several kinds of indigestion. The trouble may be due to
                        sluggishness of the liver, derangements of the bowels, enlargement of the
                        pancreas, or it may be due to the stomach itself.</p>
                    <p>In nearly all cases of stomach indigestion catarrh is the cause. The only
                        permanent cure is to remove the catarrh.</p>
                    <p>Peruna has become well-known the world over as a remedy in such cases.</p>
                    <p>For special directions everyone would read "The Ills of Life" a copy of which
                        surrounds each bottle. Peruna is for sale by all chemists and druggists.</p>
                    <p>The following wholesale druggist will supply the retail drug tade in
                        Alexandria, Egypt.</p>

                    <p>Dès l'ouverture la corbeille regorgeait de monde. L'animation n'a pas censé
                        de régner durant toute la séance à cause de l'amélioration signalée de
                        Londres sur les valeurs égyptiennes, en particulier l'Agricole et la
                        National Bank. Ici, toutefois, malgré ce beau ré le. les transactions sont
                        restées clairsemées et mus importance, limitées principalement aux Agricole,
                        National Bank, Estates, Comptoir et United Land. On semble attendre, pour se
                        lancer, que la reprise se soit affirmée à Londres.</p>
                    <p>La Cassa di Sconto continue à être l'objet de toutes les conversations, mais
                        le titre n'est pas échangé. Les cours inscrits en clôture, 52 l'ancienne
                        action et 71 la nouvelle, sont donc purement nominaux.</p>
                    <p>Bien que la Banque d'Athènes soit renseignée en baisse à Paris à 111 fr.,
                        elle a été inscrite ici à 118, mais sans affaires à ce dernier prix.</p>
                    <p>Sur l'Agricole et la National Bank, la hausse est énorme, 7/1C sur la
                        première a 8 et 1 livre 1/8 sur la seconde à 19 5/8.</p>
                    <p>La Ramleh bénéficie de 3/8 à 5 1/2 et la Delta Light de 1/8 à 9 1/8, ainsi
                        que la Du ira à 135/8.</p>
                    <p>En hausse également l'Obligation ancienne Credit Foncier de 310 à 313, les
                        Nungovich de 14 1/2 à 15, la Land Bank de 7 à 7 1/8, l'Urbaine de 4 à 4

                        Banco di Roma de 103 à 104, le Crédit Franco-Egyptien de 4 1/16 à 4 1/4, la
                        Building Lands de 2 5/10 il 2 5,8.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, la Banque d'Orient tombe de 114 à 111 ft l'Obligation nouvelle
                        Credit Foncier de 265 à 264.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, la plus-value n'est pas moins générale : les
                        Cotton Mills s'avancent de 3 à 3/3, la Delta Land de 1 11/16 à 1 3/4,
                        l'Ordinary Khedivial Mail de 22/ à 23-, l'Investment de 1/2 à 9/1 G, les
                        Estates de 7 8 à 15/16, la Levant de 19/32 à 5/8, l'United de 7/16 l'action
                        et 2 l/l la fondateur k 1/2 et 3 respectivement ; seule la Levico est un peu
                        plus faible à 3, 8.</p>
                    <p>II n'est pas possible de dire si le mouvement actuel continuera. Pour cela il
                        nous faudrait l'appui incessant des places dirigeantes qui semblent, il est
                        vrai, s'améliorer en ce moment. C'est ainsi que le taux privé d'escompte n
                        Londres a baissé «le 1/8 a 3 7/8, pendant que le Consolidé Anglais et la
                        Rente Française ont repris île quelques points. La solution de l'affaire de
                        la Cassa di Sconto exercera également une grande influence sur notre
                        marché.</p>

                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a encore gagné hier 1 4 à 83 7/8.
                        L'Unifiée est restée invariée à 100 1/4. La National Bank a haussé de non
                        moins de '£ 1 3,8 à 18 5/8, l'Agricole d'une demi-livre à 7 3/4, la Daïra
                        d'autant à 13 1/4 et la Delta Light de 7/8 à 9 1/8.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier a bénéficié de 22 francs à 678. La Banque
                        d'Athènes a progressé de 2 francs a 116.</p>
                    <p>Agréablement impressionné par la forte reprise des valeurs égyptiennes à
                        Londres et à Paris, par de multiples rumeurs rassurantes, ainsi que par la
                        bonne tenue du coton, notre marché des valeurs a présenté, ce matin, un
                        entrain auquel on n'était pas, disait-on, accoutumé depuis longue date et
                        dont on avait perdu jusqu'au souvenir. En réalité, l'animation a été
                        beaucoup plus grande qu'hier et le nombre des transactions aussi, car il
                        s'est élevé à 24 contre 12 ; il s'agit, bien entendu, des opérations
                        enregistrées en corbeille sur le-registre de la Corporation. Toujours est-il
                        que les esprits se sont rassérénés et que les dispositions semblent prêtes à
                        devenir excellentes. Aussi faut-il luire des vœux pour que cette
                        amélioration, encore que d'essence morale, se maintienne, s'accentue et
                        finisse par donner des résultats positifs.</p>
                    <p>En attendant, la National Bank, que nous laissée hier à 16 15/16, est bel et
                        bien cemontee à 18 5/16 et l'Agricole a 7 9/16 5 8. La Cassa di Sconto a
                        clôture à 50 après avoir atteint 60.</p>
                    <p>Le Crédit Foncier a regagné 10 francs à 675 et la Daira Sanieh une demi-livre
                        à 13 ]/4. Les Allotments ont avancé à 2, les Héliopolis i 250 et leur part
                        do fondateur à 10. Ig* Jouissances Eaux du Caire ont fléchi à 185.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des valeurs hôtelières, les Nongovich, aussi manipulés
                        qu'hier, ont été poussés aux abords de 16 pour finir à 15 1/4. Les Egyptian
                        sont revenus à 4 1/2. Les Excelsior opt été mieux tenus à 2 1/2-5/8.</p>

                        sortes. On</p>
                    <p>affirme que, grâce à l'intervention de Sir Ernest Cassel (auquel on attribue
                        en même temps la formation A Londres d'un syndicat appelé à soutenir les
                        valeurs égyptiennes) que l'éventualité d'une liquidation immédiate de la
                        Cassa di Sconto est écartée. 11 serait question de fonder une nouvelle
                        Banque avec un capital déterminé. Le syndicat do garantie pour l'émission
                        des actions serait constitué par le groupe Cassel et l'Union Bank.Les
                        actionnaires de la Cassa di Sconto auraient un droit de préférence A la
                        souscription des actions de la nouvelle Banque, qui procéderait à la
                        liquidation lente et méthodique de la Cassa di Sconto. Les dossiers ne
                        présentant aucun risque passeraient à la nouvelle Banque et les sommes
                        provenant de ces opérations serviraient à désintéresser les créanciers de la
                        Cassa nu fur et à mesure des échéances.</p>
                    <p>" C'est, en tout cas, ù ces informations provenant, dit-on, de Londres qu'on
                        attribue la forte reprise des valeurs égyptiennes au Stock Exchange."</p>
                    <p>Nous avons reproduit hier un passage du discours prononcé par M. J. W.
                        Williamson h l'assemblée générale ordinaire lie l'Egyptian Delta Land and
                        Investment Co. tenue samedi passé au Caire. Quelques autres parties de
                        l'allocution du président de l'assemblée seront lues avec intérêt, les
                        suivantes par exemple.</p>
                    <p>"Les ventes de terrains sont actuellement très rares et les rentrées sur les
                        terrains vendus se font difficilement. Une politique d'attente s'impose.
                        Etant donné ce qui précède, on leurrait contester l'opportunité de la
                        répartition de tous les bénéfices réalisés et, sur ce point, je vous dois
                        une explication. Quand nous nous réunirons l'année prochaine, nous aurons à
                        répartir nos bénéfices entre un plus grand nombre d'actions, car une
                        convention est intervenue entre MM. Suares frères et Co. et la Société, par
                        laquelle 100.000 actions nouvelles leur seront données (jouissance du 1er
                        Avril 1907) en échange de leurs terrains a Meadi et de £ 75,000 en espèces.
                        C'est donc par un sentiment d'équité envers les anciens actionnaires que
                        nous avons estimé ne devoir rien retenir des bénéfices déjà acquis au 31
                        Murs de l'année courante. D'ailleurs, les ventes déja effectuées dans
                        l'exercice en cour-nous permettront de donner un bon dividende l'annee
                        prochaine, si nos acheteurs tiennent leurs engagements."</p>
                    <p>En terminant, le président a parlé des négociations engagées entre la Société
                        et l'Etat relativement à une route carrossable du Caire à Hélouan et a
                        ajouté :</p>
                    <p>"Il est unanimement reconnu que cette route est absolument nécessaire et
                        qu'elle se fera tôt ou tard. J'ai, par conséquent, confiance que le
                        gouvernement profitera de l'occasion pour s'assurer plus de 4 kilomètres de
                        cette mute pour rien, d'autant plus que la Société garantit, en outre, le
                        paiement de la moitié des frais d'entretien pour une antre longue section.
                        Il est aussi question d'électrifier lu ligne Caire-Hélouan ; les pourparlers
                        sont sur le point d'aboutir et nos terrains de Meadi obtiendront ainsi une
                        plus-value appréciable. Entre temps, nous sommes en train de construire
                        quelques villas qui, lions l'espérons, seront achevées vers U fin de
                        l'année, et nous continuerons à développer et A embellir votre
                        propriété."</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
