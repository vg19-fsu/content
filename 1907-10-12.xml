                    <p>The "Morning Post" publishes the following survey of the conditions
                        prevailing in Macedonia and the Balkan states : </p>
                    <p>Signs are not wanting that during the winter the Powers will have to keep
                        anxious. watch over events in the Balkan peninsula. The report of the death
                        of two Servian ex officers in a prison at Belgrade evidently discloses very
                        ugly business indeed. The two men were anti-regicides, one of them vers
                        outspoken. The report telegraphed roads like * fiction, covering a murder by
                        the persons in authority. This is a grave matter. There was in Sorvin very
                        strong resentment against the regicides, and the fact that King Peter did
                        not see his way completely to dissociate himself from them has prevented his
                        acquiring the heartfelt allegiance of the people of Servia. There has
                        already been too much persecution of anti-regicides, and this new event
                        cannot but arouse the feelings that have been smoulder <cb n="6"/> ing, but
                        have never been extinguished, against the murderers of King Alexander and
                        minst I those who have profited by their crime. No one. knows this better
                        than King Peter, who therefore feels himself weak when what the country
                        needs is a raler firm enough in his sent to have a clear pólioy. The King,
                        looking round for a 'stay, may hope to find it in Austria, and may therefore
                        adopt what has hitherto been regarded as the anti-national policy of a pact
                        with Austria, a coarse to which he may be the more easily impelled because
                        the commercial campaign waged by Austria for the purpose of reducing Servia
                        to submission inflicts real in convenience upon the inhabitants of Servia.
                        The misfortune of Servia, is not to have a statesman on the European level
                        who can take a broad view of affairs and see Europe as a whole, looking at
                        something larger than the cliques at Belgrade. For Servis has great prog:
                        pects that may be realised by patient. The time must come when a King of
                        Servis may be able to make his bargain with statesmen of Vienna, but will
                        come only to a Service that can wait as well as watch.</p>
                    <p>In Bulgaria things are not altogether healthy. The Ministry has gone too far
                        in the direction of repression, reaction, and ChanI vinism. To have
                        dismissed all the University professors, to have trumped up a ridiculous
                        Lawsuit against one of Bulgaria's best states. men because he is rich, and
                        to have given free rein to the Anti Hellenic passions that produced riots
                        and outrages in various parts of the country and have driven thousands of
                        Greeks out of the land is to have proclaimed to Europe that the Bulgarian
                        Ministers are not of the class from which Europe expecta statesmen to be
                        drawn. The best reply to the incursions of Greek bands into Macedonia would
                        have been for the Bulgarian Government scrupulously to have protected the
                        Greeks living in Bulgarin. Neither Bulgariang nor Servians seem to have
                        fully realised that the autonomies of all the Balkan States are
                        interdependent. If one of thein is absorbed by a Great Power the others are
                        doomed, for none of them is strong enough to stand alone, least of all
                        Bulgaris. The Greek states non are remarkable for intellectual shrewdness
                        and even for their liberal education. Bat they are one and all infected with
                        the tradition of an exaggerated Hellenism. Ever looking back to the past
                        they cannot reconcile themselves to the realities of the modern world. It is
                        trite that Pericles Athens was the home of an intellectual and spiritual
                        life richer than has ever been known since. It is true that Alexander spread
                        over the whole Fast a cul. tare derived from the best of what Greece bad
                        until then produced. But the Athens of Pericles and the Empire of Alexander
                        did not exist together, and could not have done. To-day neither the one nor
                        the other is possible, but the modern Greeks dream of reproducing both at
                        once, and over their dream they lose their chances of obtaining what is
                        possible. To have attacked Turkey in the epoch of M. Delyannis would have
                        been a fine thing if there had been in the Greek troops the spirit of
                        Leonidas and his Three Hundred; but to have attacked Turkey and then to
                        retreat without serious loss of life was farcical. The Greeks have to learn
                        courage and political temperance. Instead of attempting this they are
                        permitting their bands to commit outrages in Macedonia. Their excuse is that
                        the Bulgarians began it. It is the exense of barbarians, and is unworthy of
                        Hellenism in the sense in which Hellenism has any value or meaning to
                        Europe. For the Hellenism which takes Europeans to Greece, for which Byron
                        died and of which Shelley sang, meant the humanities in their best
                        expression. While Servia.is on the verge of anarchy, Balgaria in the hands
                        of reactionaries, and Greece given over to a spirit of barbarism, Roumania
                        under the firm and judicious guid. ance of M. Stourdza is endeavouring to
                        heal the wounds created by the agrarian rising of the spring. Roumania alone
                        of th four States has the advantage of men who stand on the European level
                        both in character and in intelligence. She needs them, for the
                        stratification of her society is a danger, and her rich absentee landlords,
                        superimposed on a peasant population living in conditions as bad as those of
                        the West of Ireland twenty years ago, furnish a problem hard enough to test
                        the powers of any statesman, however capable. The Turkish Empire, the
                        neighbour of these smaller States, is also in a condition that causes some
                        anxiety. The Sultan, able, car-seeing, and determined, has made himself the
                        representative of the reaction against European influence. He has carried
                        out with perseverance and without being hampered by any consideration the
                        policy of restoring to his Empire, particularly in Asia, its Mohammedan and
                        Turkish character. He has strengthened his Army. But in doing these things
                        he has found himself unable either to lighten the burden of taxation or the
                        system of espionage, and these two concomitants of his policy have estranged
                        his subjects from it. </p>
                    <p>In these conditions of the neighbouring lands theory of injured humanity from
                        Macedonia reaches the Great Powers. It is a piercing, a terrible cry, but
                        its tones are dimmed by distance Many voices join in its confusing sound.
                        There was at first the call of the rayah for just law and upright
                        administration ; for safety of life and limb and of honour, and for the
                        elementary rights of human beings. Then came the wails of those whoses homes
                        were burned, and their kith and kin murdered, bither by bands or the
                        irregulars who were supposed to chase them. There was an author. itative
                        anarchy in which Bulgarians killed Turks And Greeks, and Tarks, Greeks, and
                        Servants killed Bulgarians. The Powers intend that all this shall cease and
                        that lite and property shall be safe in Macedonia. But the reforms have been
                        obstructed and progress been too slow, so that there is as yet no guarantee
                        against fresh troubles that may spread over the whole peninsula. </p>

                        the Nationalist Press. The reason of this outcry appears to be due to
                        professional jealousy as when "Al Guerida" represented no particular group
                        in politics it counted for nothing. Now, however, that it is the recognised

                        will have to be reckoned with by its vernacular confrères. "Al Moayad" in an
                        article on this subject remarks:-</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge that among the members of the "Party of the People" there are
                        some who are animated with sincere sentiments and noble principles, and who
                        have only attached themselves to this party because they are convinced that
                        they will render great services. thereby to their country. There are others
                        who have attained high posts and who are men of clear consciences and whose
                        assistance has been asked for, as their credit always strengthens political
                        parties. There are also among them some influential young men with a great
                        future before them. But, and nobody will gainsay the fact, among this swarm
                        of persons some individuals have introduced themselves who only want to
                        flatter those who hold the reins of Government, for the main object of the
                        foundation of "Al Guerida", was to oppose the Nationalist Press. Others have
                        been gained over because they have been ashamed to refuse to join the party,
                        while others have been recruited by the wiles of partisans..</p>

                    <p>German politicians are still eagerly speculating on the ultimate reasons for
                        the conclusion of the Convention between England and Russia, and they are
                        evidently convinced that some understanding has been arrived at be- tween
                        the two nations which does not appear in the text of the Convention.
                        Professor Hans Delbrück's opinion, expressed in the "Preussische
                        Jahrbucher," is that "what the English have conceded is a mere bagatelle to
                        what they have gained, which, in so far as agreements. signify anything, is
                        of supreme value to them." If, he continues, the Ameer of Afghanistan
                        remains an English vassal, a rampart is raised for the protection of India
                        which will be scaled with difficulty, and the dominion secured over Southern
                        Persia is another step towards the union of Egypt and India under one
                        dominion. How could Russia enter into such an Agreement? he asks, and
                        suggests a new solution, to the problem, namely, that Russia hopes thereby
                        to induce the English Money Market to take up a new Russian Loan.</p>

                        it was going to end.</p>
                    <p>It is, moreover, the first official document dealing with the prime factors
                        of the actual period published by one of the commercial Powers largely
                        represented by an ever-increasing import trade, and as such it also takes an
                        important place among those documents, written or yet to be written, which
                        might well be termed the bibliography of the financial crisis of 1907.</p>
                    <p>"Egypt," says the Baron, "from an import point of view, offers to the
                        producers of all countries an incomparable market, the extent of which our
                        manufacturers still seem to be unaware of, if one judges by the little which
                        they accomplish. To-day the principal imports to Egypt are iron, steel,
                        fuel, cereals, and manufactured products from the most common to the rarest,
                        and these will always be on the increase for many reasons, the principal two
                        of which are that local industry developes slowly, while the country greatly
                        increases in wealth, thanks to the wise administration which was established
                        twenty-five years ago."</p>
                    <p>•</p>
                    <p>In the course of his study the Belgian Minister reviews successively the
                        existing industries of the country. He then deals with the causes of the
                        increasing wealth of the country, the special climatic conditions, the
                        continuous extension of the cultivated area of land, the favourable
                        financial situation, the uninterrupted increase of imports and exports, and
                        he remarks that the considerable increase during the last few years in the
                        number of banks and the business done by these credit establishments is
                        another indication, no less important, of the activity and commercial
                        prosperity of the country. Speaking of the new companies Baron de Gaffier
                        remarks that "the rapidly increasing wealth of the country and especially
                        the formidable increase in the price of land have created alongside the
                        banks a crowd of companies. During the year 1905 there were formed thirty
                        new companies and ten founded companies increased their capitals. In 1906,
                        the progress was still more rapid, and according to the documents which I
                        have before me the number of new companies exceeded 47. At the end of 1906.
                        and at the commencement of the present year we witnessed a veritable
                        debauchery of shares." Turning to the question of land speculations, the
                        Belgian Minister considers that the success of the newly created quarters is
                        difficult to foretell and will depend especially upon the means of
                        communication granted, rather than on their distance from town, and also on
                        the public works and the manner in which they will be laid out.</p>
                    <p>Again-"During the period of speculation one did not buy to build, but to sell
                        again. The great majority of buildings was previous to this movement. They
                        do not answer to the needs of the moment and to the invested capitals. The
                        increase in rents could not compensate the bad utilisation of the plots of
                        land, and yet is not it of importance that by such means those who had
                        building land greatly depreciated it, the proprietors of bare lands, and
                        they are legion,' finding themselves possessors of dead bodies? The
                        proprietors who have, or will have, the means to endow their lands with
                        houses in accordance with the new conditions will have nothing to fear.
                        Others who involved themselves in the movement in the hope of re-selling are
                        exposed to cruel disappointments." Nevertheless "should they be subjected to
                        prosecations, forced sales, and even in some cases to ruin, that can in no
                        way affect the economic situation of the country."</p>
                    <p>It is certainly most encouraging to read so hopeful a view from one so well
                        qualified to express an opinion, for it is but another symptom that in high
                        circles the present crisis is not considered as having affected to any
                        degree the roots of the real prosperity of the country, and it is, moreover,
                        only by such declarations that one can really reassure European public
                        opinion, especially from the commercial and financial point of view on the
                        future lot of Egypt, which one is only too pleased in Europe to compare with
                        that of the Argentine Republic.</p>
                    <p>The report also deals with Belgian companies and contracts, with Egypt as a
                        field of activity. The actual amount of Belgian capital operating in Egypt
                        can be estimated at 400,000 francs (roughly £st. 16,000), and this figure
                        can be taken as somewhat under estimated. After having examined the
                        situation. of these companies and contracts, Baron de Gaiffier turns his
                        attention to the enlarging of the Port of Alexandria and the Egyptian rail-
                        ways, and then reviews the foreign trade of Egypt, analysing the parts taken
                        by the different countries as regards imports into Egypt. The countries
                        which are to the greatest degree responsible for the increase in imports
                        are. for 25,450,000 francs ,, 12,000,000 ,, 10,000,000</p>

                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>Belgium for imports now takes sixth rank</p>
                    <p>just after Germany and before Italy and her share in the general trade of
                        imports has risen from S.S. in 1905 to 5.1% in 1906. It is the country whose
                        percentage has increased most rapidly and it is worthy of note that
                        England's share as percentage in imports has hardly varied from one year to
                        the other; in 1905 it was 32.3% and in 1906 32.7%.</p>
                    <p>In reviewing the principal imports we find that in some cases Belgium is
                        practically mistress of the market, and in others she stands very high. The
                        following are the imports mentioned in the report under review: Iron and
                        worked steel, L.E. 362,659; Ironmongery, L.E. 168,589; Waggons, L.E.
                        163,168; Chemical manure, L.E 76,259; Cements, L.E. 60,855; Window-glass,
                        L.E. 43,030; Sugar, L.E. 35,158 (as compared with L.E 87 in 1904); Flour,
                        L.E. 28,151 (as compared with L.E. 87 in 1904; Linen fabrics, L.E. 27,674;
                        Glasses and mirrors, L.E. 24,559; Locks and bolts, LE. 17,061; White zinc,
                        L.E. 16,648; after which follow cast iron, glassware, arms, and chinaware,
                        cotton fabrics, bronze and zinc, chemical products, electric apparatus,
                        electric machines, cotton covers, colours, linen fabrics, hardware, and
                        coal.</p>
                    <p>The Belgian Minister has not merely given a a succession of tables, he has
                        supported them by a thorough study of the various heads of the statistical
                        tables of the Egyptian Customs, profiting by the occasion to give invaluable
                        information to Belgian exporters. We might cite as instances of this the
                        following:-cotton fabrics, hosiery, metals and works in metal, automobiles,
                        skins and works in skins, cereals, vegetables and flours, artificial indigo,
                        chemical products, not to mention the principal imports. Such is enough to
                        show the minute care with which this report has been drawn up, interesting
                        as it is in its slightest details, and affording opportunity to the Belgian
                        business man to follow the trade of his country with Egypt from one year to
                        another.</p>
                    <p>Before concluding his exhortation to Belgians to increase still more their
                        commercial activity in Egypt by the creation of new commercial
                        establishments, Baron de Gaiffier gives good advice to Belgian merchants on
                        the choice of representatives, the sending of travellers, catalogues,
                        samples, and other methods of advertisement, credits, and also the important
                        question of packing, which he says, should be as carefully done as if the
                        goods were for China or Japan. This last is a very important point for it is
                        often the making of a nation, for such and such an article, that the buyer
                        receives it in perfect good order and ready to be sold or used
                        immediately.</p>

                    <p>A CONTRAST.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                    <p>Sir, -For our French neighbours is frequently claimed the premier position
                        among the world's bankers, but I hardly think that an examination of their
                        banking system and a comparison with that of the British banks will sustain
                        this claim. Last week you published the monthly statement of the National
                        Bank of Egypt Ltd., for August, and Wednesday you published the statement of
                        the Crédit Lyonnais for the same month. Now I propose to compare these two
                        statements with the statement of eight of the leading English Banks for

                        Reserve of about 34 1/2 millions. It therefore appears that either the
                        English Banks and the National Bank of Egypt Ltd., ǎre too conservative of
                        their gold resources or that the reserve of the Credit Lyonnais is
                        insufficient. Of course I shall be told that the latter institution has
                        always the Bank of France to resort to in case of need: but that fact in
                        nowise invalidates my argument in favour of the methods of British, banking.

                    <p>A HIGHWAY WANTED.</p>
                    <p>One of the greatest wants in Egypt is that r of highways. Alexandria and
                        Cairo have been s waiting for years for road connection and yet t that much
                        felt want seems as far off as ever. s The most extraordinary need in regard
                        to a communication is that between Cairo and J Helouan. In the case of
                        Alexandria the Govern-S ment might plead that the one hundred and thirty
                        miles of intervening space through the richest agricultural district in the
                        world would necessitate an enormous amount of most costly expropriations.
                        But, in the case of Helouan and Cairo the question of communication by road
                        is on an entirely different footing. For a great part of the way the road
                        would be over the desert. Furthermore this suburb is only seventeen miles
                        from Cairo. Helouan is the most unique suburb of Cairo from the point of
                        view of desert air, but if a road existed this world-famed health resort
                        would be popularised a thousandfold. It is well-t known that the sulphur
                        springs are the second strongest in the world. From its situation
                        overlooking the Nile and the wonderful Pyramids of Sakkara and Darshur it is
                        a delightful point for excursions. It is one hundred feet over the Nile

                        the Arabian desert and such exquisite bits of scenery as the wonderful Wady
                        Hof. Yet in spite of all these actractions no motorist can make his way
                        thither from Cairo, and Helouan up to now is soley dependent on its line of
                        railway. Surely the Government ought to consider this claim of Cairo's
                        favourite suburb to the necessary expenditure for a high road to unite it
                        with Cairo.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE "</p>
                        <p>Sir, With the return of the eminent Anglo-Indian specialist, Mr. Carkeet
                            James, to Cairo and with the immediate advent of Sir William Garstin to
                            Europe next week, the question of the final settlement of the site ne-
                            cessary for the Cairo sewage work has once again come forward. The
                            subject is of vital importance to many land development companies,
                            besides private individuals, who have the building of their own houses
                            in view. From what one can gather it would appear that the two sites
                            mostly in favour are those actually situated to the north and south of
                            the city. These chosen spots are Khanka and Tourah. In view of the fact
                            that Rod el Farag, where the wells of the water supply are situated, is
                            on the north, it is impossible to have the sewage overflow thereabouts.
                            Surely in a city of this sort, where in summer the wind always blows
                            from the north, one could assume that a southern site was absolutely
                            necessary to the health of the public. No doubt the authorities have
                            been considering all these points and it is sincerely to be hoped that
                            they will at last cease from their extraordinary policy of silence and
                            take the public into their confidence.</p>

                        <head>PRINCE DABRO.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir.</p>
                        <p>In your yesterday's issue I found a few lines about the Khedive's heir, a
                            certain Prince Dabro in Texas.</p>
                        <p>I beg to inform you that Dabro is the family name of late Dicran Pasha,
                            The Dabros descend from an ancient family of rulers. Hence the title of
                            Prince. The regretted Pasha did not make use of the title of Prince,
                            most probably for political reasons. But his brother and son are called
                            Princes. The son, the Prince Aram Dabro is well known in Cairo. He is a
                            big land owner. It is quite possible that he visits the United States to
                            study the cotton industry.</p>
                        <p>New York journalists finding the name of a Prince in a high class hotel
                            visitors' list, run to have an interview. Naturally His Highness tells
                            them that he has come to see how the Americans cultivate the cotton, the
                            most important production of Egyptian soil. The journalists thinking
                            that this is not worthy of a Prince from the land of Pharoahs add
                            the</p>
                        <p>rest.</p>
                        <p>Imagination is very rife in some newspaper correspondents, on both sides
                            of the Atlantic. See, what some English papers said about His.
                            Excellency Boghos Pasha Nubar, a few weeks ago. His Excellency could
                            never think of uld never thin telling any man that, he owns the Egyptian
                            Railways. With all that it was repeated in several papers. Why not
                            inquire from a reliable source.</p>
                        <p>Yours Respectfully,</p>

                    <p>Probably the life of the Emperor of Austria is of greater importance to the
                        peace of Europe than that of any other living ruler and the news of his
                        present indisposition will be a source of grave disquietude. This morning's
                        telegram is a little more reassuring, but considering that he is seventy-six
                        years of age the slightest indisposition is dangerous. Francis Joseph I was
                        born on August 18th, 1830, at Schönbrunn, where he is now lying ill.</p>

                    <head>THE CAIRO STREETS.</head>
                    <p>A letter appears to-day in the columns of a contemporary, calling attention
                        to the state of the roads in Cairo. Such complaints, which are unfortunately
                        fully justified by the existing state of a large number of the streets, are
                        frequent enough, but up to the present time apparently no effort has been
                        made by the authorities to remedy the cause. The main thoroughfares, for the
                        most part, leave nothing to be desired, but once depart from these roads and
                        one might as well be in the heart of the country where the tanzim is
                        unknown. There are some streets in the Cairo of to-day which are, by reason
                        of their filth, unfit for a pedestrian to use, while should he essay to
                        cycle through them, the result would be disastrous both to machine and
                        rider. Rough and uneven, malodorous and filthy, they remain from year to
                        year a blot on the boasted civilization of Cairo. One cannot believe that it
                        is ignorance which causes the tanzim to continue their policy of playing
                        with the question, instead of striking at the root of the evil and putting
                        competent men to the work of re-laying the roads on an approved modern
                        system. And yet if it is not ignorance, what is it ?</p>
                    <p>Is it due to lack of funds or to lack of men, or simply to lack of thought?
                        But whatever the reason, the fact remains that certain of the streets of
                        Cairo are a disgrace to the town, that the time has come when it is a matter
                        of necessity that something should be done, and that a long suffering public
                        expects it to be done at once.</p>
