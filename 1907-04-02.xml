                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE KHEDIVE AND THE "TIMES." </head>
                    <p>The following are the criticisms of the " Times " on the recent declarations
                        of the Khedive :—.</p>
                    <p>— There was a time, only a few years ago, when such an interview as that
                        which the Khedive has granted to a French journalist, and our Paris
                        Correspondent reports to-day, would have given occasion for grave
                        uneasiness. That we can now afford to regard it as nothing more than an
                        unpleasant reminder of the Khedive's usual attitude towards this country is
                        a sign of the increased strength of our position in Egypt, and still more of
                        our cordial relations with the other Power chiefly interested in Northern
                        Africa. The whole character of the Khedive's remarks invites this
                        reflection, though it shows only too plainly that the change is none of his
                        seeking. But even if the tone of the interview did not suggest this contrast
                        between the present and the past, His Highness has added a curious remark at
                        the end which would make it impossible for us to forget the fact. He gave
                        his interlocutor, the special correspondent of the "Temps," a greeting to
                        the French people with these enigmatic words:—" We do not forget what they
                        have been for us, and we are very fond of them " <hi rend="italic">all the
                            same</hi>. " It is the French journalist who italicized the words which
                        our Paris Correspondent has reported. If they mean anything, there is only
                        one meaning they can bear. The Khedive dates the strain which France has put
                        upon his friendship from her conclusion of the entente with us. Provisions
                        about Egypt, like provisions about Morocco, formed an integral part of the
                        agreement, and it is as a result of them, and of their loyal observance by
                        France, that we have been able to carry on our salutary work in Egypt with
                        no fear of vexatious obstruction. To any one who protests his devotion to
                        his country's welfare so strongly as the Khedive this ought to be a matter
                        for genuine satisfaction. But it is evidently to the period before the
                        entente that His Highness's pleasant recollections are confined—a period
                        when French interests were inconstant antagonism to our own, and when the
                        progress and security of Egypt were exposed to continual risk on account of
                        this friction. We do not suppose for a moment that the French people will
                        take the Khedive's view of recent history. If they continue in friendly
                        intercourse with Egypt, we shall be as gratified as His Highness, but we do
                        not think they will show a disposition to return to the attitude that
                        preceded the entente. The mutual benefits of the entente, moral and
                        material, are too well realized, the solidarity of our interests in Northern
                        Africa is too plain, for either nation to be willing to disturb it at the
                        prompting of an interested third party.</p>
                    <p>The substance of the Khedive's remarks is, we are sorry to say, in only too
                        faithful agreement with his final innuendo. No one ignorant of the modern
                        history of Egypt, and going to this conversation for enlightenment, would
                        guess even remotely what its course had been. He would imagine the Egyptians
                        to be a people who had worked out their own salvation. He would suppose this
                        to have been done under the beneficent initiative of Abbas II.—a
                        much-suffering ruler who, however, even in the darkest moments never relaxed
                        his ungrudging efforts for his people's good. That the country had been
                        brought out of distracted anarchy by the tutelage of another Power ; that
                        this Power had preserved both the dynasty and the safety of its heritage —
                        all this would never dawn on one who took his history from the Khedive. Yet
                        the father of Abbas II. owed his retention of the throne to us. His Highness
                        himself owes his personal security and the integrity of his dominions to the
                            sup<cb n="6"/>port of British power. The material develo­ment of his
                        country, on which he dwells with complacency, is due similarly to Great
                        Britain ; for, as a French writer pointed out in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Depeche Coloniale</hi> the other day, it was she who inspired capital
                        with confidence and attracted it to Egypt, by consolidating the political
                        situation, establishing order in the administration and finances, and
                        undertaking the great public works in aid of commerce and agriculture. At
                        one or two points of the interview, it is true, the Khedive tries to
                        reassure opinion. He declares emphatically that it is wrong to assume that
                        the "national" claims are anti-foreign and fanatic. We would gladly accept
                        that assurance, but we cannot forget that it is precisely the same as those
                        lavished by the notorious agitator Mustapha Pasha Kamel, whose national
                        patriotism is of an unmistakably anti-British brand. Though His Highness
                        deprecates the idea that he could possibly become a despot, it would not be
                        too much to say that, in the necessarily restricted sphere where he now
                        wields personal authority, it bears every mark of arbitrariness. Nor can a
                        single-minded devotion to progress be seriously claimed by a ruler who has
                        stood aside, often ostentatiously, from our efforts to benefit Egypt, and
                        who allows favouritism and corruption to be rife in the public departments
                        which still come within his influence.</p>
                    <p>The "Times" concludes with the following comments on the letter of Sir
                        Christopher Furness, of which a telegraphic summary has appeared in a former
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>A truer picture of the real Egypt, and of the men who have made it, is to be
                        gathered from the instructive letter by Sir Christopher Furness M. P, He has
                        returned from a stay in Egypt, " where the extraordinary results of British
                        administrative genius, ' as he says, " compel admiration." But having enough
                        experience of men and cities to know that a short tour in another land does
                        not qualify the visitor to say the last word about it, he tells us that he
                        would not have raised his protest against the policy pursued by a fellow
                        Liberal, Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P., if he did not know that Mr. Robertson's
                        acquaintance with Egypt were no greater than his own. But Mr. Robertson, and
                        other Englishmen who like traducing the work of their country abroad, never
                        allow the scantiness of their knowledge to stop them. Where their aspersions
                        come into touch with facts they can generally be refuted without much
                        trouble, as Sir Christopher Furness refutes them in a single particular by
                        his effective account of the reform of justice under Lord Cromer's
                        administration. Nor do the traducers carry enough weight at home for
                        sensible people to pay much attention to them. But it is otherwise among the
                        native populations with whom they are constantly making mischief, and to the
                        credulous, excitable Egyptian public it may seem a matter of real
                        significance that letters by Mr. Robertson, a British member of Parliament
                        and one of the Government's supporters, should appear in the Cairo
                        "Standard," Mustapha Kamel's Nationalist organ. As regards British policy it
                        is of no significance, unless it be significant that, after the severe
                        handling he received from Sir Edward Grey last summer, Mr. Robertson should
                        have thought it safer to transfer his reflections from the House of Commons
                        to a Cairene journal. But native readers do not appreciate this, and all the
                        heavier, therefore, is the responsibility of those Europeans who seek to
                        play on their ignorance and fanaticism. Influences of this kind, whether
                        consciously or unconsciously exerted, are not confined to Egypt. The French,
                        who are now deploring the brutal assasination of a fellow-countryman in
                        Morocco, are inclined to read in this regrettable event another sign of the
                        mischievous effect which political intrigues in Europe have had on the
                        receptive Moorish mind.</p>

                    <byline>(Gazette's Special Service.)</byline>
                    <dateline>London, Tuesday</dateline>
                    <p>The account of an important interview with Lord Cromer appears in the
                        "Temps." The interview was granted to M. René Puaux and took place recently
                        at Cairo. His Lordship expressed the great satisfaction which he felt at the
                        recent revival of French interest in Egypt. He always had the interests of
                        the Anglo-French "entente cordiale" at heart and the agreement between the
                        two countries was felt in Egypt as making for the policy of progress which
                        he is pursuing.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer then went on to speak of his report on Egypt for 1906. He
                        declared that he again treats of the subject of the Capitulations in this
                        report but does not deal with them with a view to their suppression but with
                        the object of adapting them to the modern conditions prevailing in Egypt by
                        transferring their legal functions to Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer made some important observations on one of the developments of
                        the extraordinary financial and commercial prosperity of Egypt, and
                        expressed some anxiety about the great increase in the numbers of the new
                        companies, which had been floated of late on the local market. M René Puaux
                        in commenting on their animadversions of his Lordship added that the
                        slightly pessimistic tone in Lord Cromer's allusions to this subject were
                        easily comprehensible as coming from a man of such proverbial integrity, as
                        was acknowledged even by his adversaries, and were inspired by a dislike of
                        the profits not produced by work.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN NATIONALISM.<lb/>THE KHEDIVE'S DECLARATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The declarations of the Khedive to M. Puaux are the subject of considerable
                        comment in the local Press and it is assumed that the statements made by His
                        Highneea on the subject of the national claims show that he has taken his
                        position in the Egyptian Nationalist Party. The frankness, with which the
                        Khedive specially alluded to the national claims should not be received with
                        any uneasiness for it has long been known how much His Highness sympathised
                        with that section of the natives, who are designated by the vague term "The
                        Nationalist Party." On the contrary the fact that his Highness has emerged
                        from his obscurity and publicly allowed his political ideals to be
                        proclaimed to the world should do much to make the situation in Egypt
                        clearer, especially in England.</p>
                    <p>La "Reforme" lays special stress on the Khedive's statements on the subject
                        of "révendications nationales" and remarks "To-day the Khedive declares
                        himself as the guarantor before the world of the sentiments of his subjects,
                        and he defines the character of the national claims. It is in this phrase
                        that all the importance of the interview granted to the distinguished
                        representative of the "Temps" lies."</p>
                    <p>The "Progres" states that the remarks of the Khedive show that his Highness
                        has taken his place in the ranks of the Nationalist Party. "None of the
                        'national claims' made by the "Lewa" and repeated by the National Assembly
                        have been forgotten by the Khedive. The satisfaction of the intellectual and
                        moral needs of the people, the co-operation of the nation with the
                        Sovereign, all such statements form a fitting pendant in the interview with
                        his denial, as to the existence of fanaticism, and his silence in regard to
                        the Occupation. However, the declarations of the Khedive have one merit,
                        namely in the fact that they have rendered all equivocation impossible. The
                        Khedive declared that he never disdained advice. But this announcement is
                        historically incorrect. However, if it shows a new disposition on the part
                        of the Khedive the announcement is most opportune, for the Khedive never
                        needed good advice more than he does now. The best advice to give him is to
                        recall to his mind the history of the Princes, who are his immediate
                        predecessors. He will see that the Khedive Ismail lost his throne because he
                        fraternised with the National Party and that the Khedive Tewfik owed his
                        throne to the Occupation, which crushed that party. The connection of the
                        Khediviate with the National Party has always been fatal."</p>
                    <p>"Al Moayad" remarks: We have conned his Highness's declarations over and over
                        again and cannot find a single word which his Highness should have left
                        unsaid. As a native of high rank, as the ruler of Egypt, and as a Moslem
                        Emir, who knows his religion and the circumstances of other religions in the
                        East and West, the Khedive had the right to say every word of the
                        declaration in question.</p>
                    <p>"Al Gerida" remarks :— "What in the Khedive's declarations can have offended
                        the British? Is it because he did not give high praise to the Government ?
                        The last sentences of his Highness's statements ("I have never opposed
                        measures which I thought to be useful to Egypt I have never disdained
                        advice.") can only mean that the prosperity of the country, to which he
                        referred, was the fruit of the works of the Government, and necessarily
                        through the advice of the occupants."</p>
                    <p>"Al Minbar" says:– "As we have already said the statements of the Khedive are
                        simple and contain nothing extraordinary. Those who endeavour to associate
                        his Highness with any political party are only the <hi rend="italic"
                            >dukhala</hi> enemies of Egypt and the Egyptians, and also of the
                        British. On reading the "Times" comments we could find nothing worthy of
                        translation. Weakness and perplexity are evident in that paper's
                        article".</p>

                    <head>OBITUARY.<lb/>MR. E. C. HOGG.</head>
                    <p>We regret to announce the death of Mr. E. C. Hogg, which took place this
                        morning at his Cairo residence at Ghezireh. He was recently attacked by
                        pneumonia and his fragile constitution was incapable of resisting the
                        malady. The death of Mr. Hogg will cause great regret at Cairo and
                        Alexandria for he counted a large circle of friends in both cities. He
                        wasabn old resident at Alexandria and had lived here for many years during
                        his official career in the Coastguards Administration, which he joined from
                        the Royal Navy. A few years ago be retired from the service and embarked as
                        a stockbroker in Cairo, where he had considerable success and was trusted by
                        a large number of clients who had an unfailing confidence in the sterling
                        integrity of his character and the keenness of his judgment in financial
                        matters.</p>
                    <p>He leaves a widow, the daughter of Mr. Peel of Alexandria, and a young family
                        to deplore his loss.</p>

                    <head>THE IRISH DINNER.</head>
                    <p>The Irish dinner was held last night at the Grand Continental Hotel under the
                        presidency of Mr. J. Langley. The dinner was largely attended, over fifty
                        members of the Irish colony in Cairo being present. After the toast of the
                        King had been honoured, Mr. Langley, in giving the toast of Ireland,
                        expressed his deep regret at the sad event which had led to the postponement
                        of the dinner. By the death of Mr. Verschoyle he had lost a dear friend and
                        colleague.</p>
                    <p>The chairman then described the progress of the Irish dinner club, pointing
                        out that it had trebled its number of members since the first dinner was
                        given four years ago. He was glad to see so many members of the two famous
                        Irish regiments, the Inniskilling Dragoons and the Inniskilling Fusiliers,
                        who, he hoped would long remain in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>He then called upon every Irishman present to drink the toast of Ireland. No
                        further speeches were made, and the rest of the evening passed quietly, an
                        informal smoking concerned being organised.</p>
                    <p>Great credit is due to the secretary, Mr. L. B. Weldon, who spared no effort
                        in organising the dinner, and we must not forget the band of the
                        Inniskilling Fusiliers, who gave a fine selection of Irish airs.</p>

                        each per annum and a share in the profits as undermentioned ; 5 per cent. of
                        any available profits is to be carried to reserve until such reserve reaches
                        10 per cent. of the paid-up capital, and afterwards 2½ per cent. of such

                    <head>END OF THE SEASON.<lb/>LAST SAVOY DANCE.</head>
                    <p>Though no dance was advertised for Saturday night at the Savoy, but rumours
                        had gone abroad that the ballroom and orchestra would be available should
                        they be wanted ; and as many people turned up for dinner and several big
                        parties had been arranged, the evening terminated with quite one of the
                        cheeriest dances of the season. Mrs. Berners was one of those who
                        entertained quite a large party of friends, her guests including Lady
                        Rogers, the Hon. C. Littleton, Capt. and Mrs. Rome, Miss Leverieh, Miss
                        Hurley, Capt. and Mrs. Schreiber, Miss A. Reed, Miss Schreiber, Miss Yorke,
                        Capt. Pardou, Mr. L Reid, Mr. F. Watson, Mr. Barton, Mr. K. Speir, and Mr.
                        Barnard. Sir James also had a party, among whom were Mr. and Mrs. Appleton,
                        Miss Fulpin, Miss Blyth, Col. Maberly, Col. Persse, Major Neil Haig, Capt.
                        Mattheuws, Capt. Darrell, and Mr. Parker. Lord and Lady Carnarvon were
                        entertaining Lord and Lady Lanesborough among their other guests. Mr. and
                        Mrs. Smallman had a party of twelve, and Capt. and Mrs. Fitzgerald had
                        guests with them, as had also Mr. and Mrs Peach. Mr. Horschitz was
                        entertaining Mr. and Miss Bennett and Miss Ers ine Shaw ; and many of the
                        officers of the various regiments were also dining in the restaurant. Quite
                        a number of other residents arrived after dinner, and the dance, which was
                        supposed to be quite an informal affair sans programmes, sans buffet,
                        developed into one of the usual order, light refreshments being provided,
                        and many suppers being ordered afterwards. Though there were plenty of
                        dancers there was no crowd, and altogether this impromptu affair proved most
                        successful.</p>
                    <p>We hear that there are to be no more dances this season at the Semiramis
                        Hotel ; and it is probable that the one at Mena House this week will be the
                        last of the series. Those on Monday night at Shepheard's may be continued
                        for some weeks yet, but it is not likely that there will be any more at
                        Ghezireh after this week.</p>

                    <head>STRIKE OF COAL HEAVERS</head>
                    <p>Our Port Said correspondent writes :—The coal discharging Arabs at this port
                        have gone on strike, their demand being an increase in pay of 25 cts. per
                        ton discharged. Some eight or nine colliers are in the harbour waiting to
                        discharge, and the coal supply in the lighters is rapidly becoming
                        exhausted. It is feared that influence is being brought to bear upon the
                        coal-loading Arabs in order to make the strike general and that serious
                        results may ensue.</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>The bunkering Arabs have joined the strike and the ships are compelled to
                        coal with their own crews.</p>

                    <head>EASTER DAY AT ST. MARKS.</head>
                    <p>The Easter Festival celebrated on Sunday last was encouraging from every
                        point of view. At the first service, 7 a.m, there were 19 communicants, at
                        the 8 o'clook service 80, and at the midday service 72, a total of 171
                        compared with 141 in the previous year This must be greatly appreciated by
                        Canon Ward, the Chaplain. The musical part of the services was excellently
                        rendered and showed the care the choir had taken in rehearsing the music.
                        The morning service opened with Hymn 134 sung to the well known "Ancient and
                        Modern" tune, but whose author is unknown. The "Te Deum" by Vine Hall and
                        the Choral Communion Service by Baptiste Calkin were carefully given and
                        with good precision. We hope the choir will repeat these. The anthem in the
                        morning was Myles Foster's "As it began to dawn towards the first day of the
                        week, " which concludes with Bishop Wordsworth's Hymn " Allelulia !
                        Alleiulia ! Hearts and voices heavenward raise, " set to beautiful music by
                        Foster. The solos were taken by Miss Maud Callender and Mr. Percy Smith,
                        both being in excellent voice and singing well. The choir also acquitted
                        themselves well. At the close of the morning service the National Anthem was
                        sung. The Anthem "As it began to dawn" was repeated in the evening, when
                        Vine Hall's "Magnificat" and "Nunc Dimittis" were beautifully given and
                        reflected credit on the careful handling by the choir. The organist, Mr.
                        Heaton gave valuable assistance throughout the day and at the close of each
                        service gave Gaul's "Soldiers' March," from the Holy City." Special mention
                        is due to the willing helpers, who so tastefully and appropriately decorated
                        the Church. Miss Dodd was responsible for the pulpit; Miss Morrison and Miss
                        Barwell for the font; Mrs Eyre and Miss Spurgeon for the lectern; Mrs. and
                        Miss Roberts for the choir stalls : Miss Batcheller for the chapel; Mrs
                        Algernon Ward for the altar gases. Among those who sent plants and flowers
                        were Mmes. Borton, Crafton, Dickson, Foster, Hopkinson, Picton, Preston, W.
                        T Smith, and Messrs. Batcheller, Coates, Morrison, and Messrs. Cornish and

                        by a Reuter's telegram, was born in London on September 7, 1854, and was the
                        eldest son of the late Thomas Henry Elliot of Rue Ruhmkorff, Paris. He was
                        educated privately and at the age of eighteen he entered the Inland Revenue
                        Department by open competition. He was private Secretary to the Rt. Hon.
                        C.T. Ritchie, when the latter was president of the Local Government Board,
                        and for six years he was member of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation.
                        Since 1892 he had been Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
                        He was created C B. in 1897 and and in 1902 was made K. C. B. He married a
                        daughter of the late Jamas Rowe in 1880.</p>

                    <p>M. George Vayssié continues his career as a humorist of a high order.
                        Saturday's "Journal du Cairo" contains a really brilliant parody of M.
                        Puaux's letters to the "Temps" from which we take the following passage.</p>
                    <p>"The famous Paris journal "La Nuit" has just despatched to Egypt the equally
                        famous reporter Dupont, the well known globe-trotter who discovered Naples
                        and Vesuvius in 1906. We have been lucky enough to have communicated to us
                        the eminent M. Dupont's first letter to "La Nuit" This is rare good fortune.
                        We even give our readers the first view, for the article will be published
                        in "La Nuit" before they appear in Paris.</p>
                    <p>"Notes by the way. <hi rend="italic">At Sea</hi>. The sea is really a very
                        curious thing. I don't really know why so much merriment has been expended
                        on Marshal MacMahon. In the presence of the ocean he ejaculated "What a lot
                        of water" and yet that is the cry that rises to one's lips in face of the
                        boundless horizon........................ There is even too much of it, for
                        excess is a defect. Shipwrecks in fact can only be attributed to a
                        super-abundanoe of water ! The victims of the deep nearly always perish
                        through submersion. Cases like the "Iena" disaster are decidedly rare. There
                        is too much water below and around them. If there were less water below it
                        the ship could ride out the storm resting on the bottom—if these were less
                        all around the shipwrecked could easily gain dry land.................
                        ...</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">In sight of the shore of Africa.</hi> I have just
                        experienced a strong emotion. A sort of illuminated tower rises over there
                        from the sea. I ask what it is. They reply "c'est Le Phare d'Alexandrie."
                        Antiquities exercise a real fascination upon me. There is the celebrated
                        monument which since Alexander's days has thrown its beams over the
                        waters...</p>

                        by my arrival at Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Quite a European town. Good quays, docks and even carriages. Th-employes are
                        decently dressed and appear to be able to write. In the streets few or none
                        are completely naked. At the hotel my astonishment redoubles......On a table
                        I find a copy of "La Nuit" Who would have believed it! They read "La Nuit"
                        at Alexandria! And here are the "Figaro," "La Vie Parisienne." Some
                        traveller must have left them here.…. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">The Great Interview</hi>. By the exercise of great skill I
                        have at last obtained an interview with H H. the Khedive. I arranged the
                        scheme of my questions with address, and thanks to my methods, the character
                        and intentions of the Sovereign appear under a blinding light...I asked H.
                        H. the Khedive, Abbas Hilmi the following questions.</p>
                    <p>" Is it true your Highness that you have prepared a coup d'etat against
                        England for the night of March 31—April 1 next.</p>
                    <p>" This report is quite unfounded—I have prepared no such coup, for the
                        excellent reason that I cannot. I should obviously be delighted to show Lord
                        Cromer to the door, but as there is a chance of reciprocity being practised
                        in these matters I prefer to abstain." </p>
                    <p>" Is it true that your Highness is a fanatic and loathes Europeans. ?</p>
                    <p>" Not a shade of fanaticism is in me. As a Moslem I naturally set the Moslems
                        above all other peoples, and their religion above all other religions which
                        are utter impostures. Were I an absolute monarch I should obviously deprive
                        myself of the assistance of European gentleman, if not of European ladies,
                        for I know how to make destructions between Europeans well enough. But I am
                        not an absolute monarch.</p>
                    <p>" Is it a fact, that your Highness is wasting your civil list and personal,
                        fortune in rash extravagance. "</p>
                    <p>" That is not strictly true. I myself indulge in strict economy, for a
                        Sovereign should set the example of thrift, parsimony and good bargains to
                        his people. Some princes of my family do not seem to look at things in the
                        same light, so I have been obliged to retain in my possession a part of
                        their allowances, of which they made the most deplorable use. Morality !
                        that is my motto.</p>

                            <p>According to a competent authority, the interpretation published by
                                the "Temps" of Professor Maartens' declaration is absolutely
                                incorrect If the latter said that the responsibility of a government
                                was grave, which desired to render nugatory the whole Conference by
                                academic discussions on demobilisation, it is impossible to
                                attribute this to Germany, as she is not desirous of making a sine
                                qua-non of the discussion of demobilisation. She will take part at
                                the Conference in spite of sundry reserves and supplementary
                                propositions brought forward by certain states in the Russian
                                programme Consequently if the "Temps" pretends that Germany insists
                                upon the non-discussion of demobilisation as a condition of her
                                participation in the Conference, the "Temps" is wrong. (Reuter)

                            <p>In reply to an enquiry Herr Tschirschky stated that the news
                                published by the "Daily Telegraph" and the "Tribune" with reference
                                to the possibility of the retirement of Germany from the Hague
                                Conference was unfounded. He expressed the hope that despite all
                                misrepresentations the closer association of Germany and Great
                                Britain would progress. (Reuter)</p>

                                showing the fury of des- i peration. Disorders have been renewed in
                                many pacified districts on the withdrawal of the troops for service
                                elsewhere. 120,000 troops are now distributed over the country.

                            <p>Mr. Gladstone has advised the King to commute the sentence passed on
                                Rayner to penal servitude for life.</p>
                            <p>The "Daily Mail," "Standard," and "Daily Telegraph" denounce the
                                commutation of the sentence as a concession to hysterical
                                emotionalism and a dangerous precedent involving admission of
                                degeneracy as an extenuating circumstance. The "Tribune," "Daily
                                News," and "Morning Leader" approve of the commutation. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The grant paid by Egypt to the Sudan will be reduced next year by L.E 45,000.
                        Similar reductions will be made annually until the grant is no longer needed
                        The Sudan will then commence to pay an interest of 3 % upon all sums
                        hitherto received. Likewise, commencing with next year, all funds required
                        for public works in the Sudan will be advanced by the Egyptian Government
                        and an interest of 3 % will be charged.</p>
                    <p>The "Sudan Times" commenting on this news remarks :—</p>
                    <p>The very important decision which the Egyptian and Sudan Governments have
                        recently arrived at with regard to the financial relations between the two
                        Governments, and which we report to-day will be a turning point in the
                        history of the Sudan. It will effect the whole financial aspect in this
                        country That the Sudan cannot dispense with the financial assistance of
                        Egypt is admitted on all hands, but on the other hand it has been contended
                        that Egyptian funds should not be expended in the Sudan without any return,
                        apart from the many indirect benefits which Egypt derives from a state of
                        peace in this country and the control it now has over the waters of the
                        Nile. </p>
                    <p>It will be remembered that this arrangement was foreshadowed by Lord Cromer
                        in one of his annual reports on Egypt and the Sudan. None will forget the
                        acrimonious criticism which was directed to the British for their alleged
                        partiality to the Sudan. It was deemed a waste of money to support the Sudan
                        Government until the country was sufficiently developed to defray the
                        expenditure of its government People had objected to the surrender of the
                        Sudan to the Dervishes and they objected to its maintenance when it had been
                        recovered.</p>
                    <p>The L.E. 45,000 which will be deducted from the next year's grant will be
                        more than compensated for by the Sudan Customs revenues, most of which found
                        its way into the Egyptian Treasury before the opening of Port Sudan. The
                        regular and normal increase in the revenues of the Sudan under an efficient
                        and capable administration is a sufficient guarantee that the country will
                        soon be able to pay its way, and will before long have enough to devote to
                        the important projects which make for the development of its rich rè-
                        80urces.</p>
                    <p>A glance at the brief history of the Sudan finance will be sufficient to
                        justify these sanguine hopes The estimated receipts for the first financial
                        year of the government were L.E. 7,000. In seven years' time they reached
                        L.E. 621,943 and the actual receipts will probably exceed this figure by
                        some L.E. 100,000 or more.</p>

                        <head>BILLIARD MATCH AT SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.<lb/>INTERESTING STRUGGLE.</head>
                        <p>There have, in late years, been many interesting and hard fought billiard
                            matches decided on the tables of the magnificent hail of historic
                            Shepheard'8 Hotel, but we question whether any excited so much interest
                            and produced such all round good play as the match between the doyen of
                            markers in Egypt, Percy, and Syers, the well-known and most popular
                            marker of the Grand Continental Hotel.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances were somewhat out of the ordinary, the supporters of
                            Percy, the winner of the annual tournament this season, putting up a
                            substantial purse for a match between him and Syers, five hundred up on
                            equal terms, Syers previously having always conceded points The Billiard
                            Hall was crowded by half past nine, the time appointed for the opening
                            of the match, and Syer was mainly fancied, although playing on a strange
                            table and with ivory balls, (Syer invariably preferring to play with
                            bonzoline.) Percy immediately settled down to steady work, contributing
                            useful breaks of 15, 21, 18, 19, 18 and 16, whilst Syer after a break of
                            15 could do nothing, and absolutely stood still at 20, the veteran
                            reaching the first hundred with his opponent 26. Percy continued to
                            forge ahead with comparatively small, but eminently useful, breaks,
                            until at last Syer got into his stride and came away with a pretty break
                            of 30. Percy made a feeble rejoinder, and Syer made a good screw back
                            off the red and got the balls in position, but broke down after
                            compiling 15. He subsequently scored a number of small breaks, and
                            reached his hundred with Percy only 41 ahead. Breaks of 17 and 18
                            respectively by Percy and Syer followed, and the latter was playing with
                            such confidence that he looked to have the issue in keeping. He passed
                            Percy at 162, putting together an admirable break of 50, and reached 200
                            with Percy standing at 170. Percy, however, made a series of useful
                            breaks, and at the interval the game stood</p>
                        <p>Percy 251 Syer 236,</p>
                        <p>odds being freely laid on the latter player.</p>
                        <p>On the resumption of the game, after an interval of ten minutes, during
                            which a very handsome collection had been made for the eventual loser,
                            Syer put together 33, and 22 in successive breaks, and claimed 300 with
                            Percy at 271. The latter made a clever break of 42, in which there was
                            some element of luck. Syer again seemed to stand still, and Percy
                            entered the last lap with his opponent having 345 to his credit. Nothing
                            seemed to come amiss to Percy, and Syer experienced on several occasions
                            the worst of luck Percy made breaks of 32, two of 18, and smaller
                            contributions which brought him very near home, when Syer pulled himself
                            together and made a series of beautiful breaks under most difficult
                            conditions. The game closed Percy 500, Syer 433, Percy thus winning a
                            most interesting contest by 67.</p>
