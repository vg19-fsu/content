                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS AND THEIR HISTORY.</head>
                    <p>The history of mankind affords such numerous examples of institutions which
                        survived their utility to become absolutely pernicious that human progress
                        might almost be define! as the record of their successiye overthrows. Yet
                        whenever their survival is in any way menaced, feelings of doubt and
                        apprehension assail the majority, which includes many who have suffered from
                        the very laws and customs which they cherish and defend, and even Radicals
                        display a curious inclination to adore that which they but lately threatened
                        to give to the flame. I may be urged that this sort of sentimentality has no
                        lasting effects; but is this the truth May not its effects last long enough
                        for a new generation to suffer from anrepealed abuses and be driven to fin I
                        drastic remedies for their sufferings 1 Their senti- mental forbears lookel
                        on these anachronism- as the aged poor of the domain of institutions. but
                        they regard them as sturdy beggars and decide that as they steadily refuse
                        to 'work', they must go. In what stage is the Egyptian public, or rather the
                        European public resident in Egypt? What are its feelings? Does it
                        contemplate any modifi cation of the Capitulations with concern or distress,
                        or does it long for their instant aboli- tion 1 Ten years ago we should have
                        supported the former hypothesis and we have no inten- tion of supporting the
                        latter. But it seems that, the better elements of the European colony in
                        Egypt have for the most part passed the sentimental period and are capable
                        of regarding these interesting survivals of the past with a calm and
                        dispassionate consideration. It cannot be denied that there are unworthy
                        elements among the resident Europeans whose reluctance to any modification
                        in the Capitulations is due to self-interest.</p>
                    <p>These exactments, which were intended to secure the safety and liberty of
                        honest merchants trading in Moslem countries, have, become in too many cases
                        the safeguard of undesirables who have battened on this country for years
                        and who dread changes that will put a limit to their powers of enriching
                        themselves through the vice or folly of other Europeans and of the people of
                        Egypt. It is natural enough that they should complain: their im munity from
                        interference in the past has given them a monopoly in certain occupations,
                        and the monopolist-even if his monopoly be illicit distilling or gun
                        running-proclaims himself before gods and men an oppressed and injured being
                        when the first rumour of interference reaches his ears. We know that a large
                        class which lives by its own wits and the vices of others will strenuously
                        oppose any modification of the Capitulations, but when we <cb n="6"/> are
                        asked to believe that the representatives of the Powers in Egypt and their
                        respective Governments are likely to be moved by supplications emanating
                        from gambling-hells and disorderly houses, or by the menaces of smugglers
                        and souteneurs, our imagination refuses to follow such fantastic paths, of
                        prophecy and "Credat Judacus Apella" is our answer. No! All criticism worth
                        discussing must come from the honest and law-abiding members of our European
                        communities, and if practical proposals for the reform and modifica tion of
                        the Capitulations are brought forward we are sure that the Egyptian
                        Government will not for a moment neglect to pay attention to the views of
                        honorable and worthy men. But we have neither the opportunity nor the desire
                        for speculation on the nature and the extent of any such changes. There are
                        in our European community, as in every other, men who are inclined to oppose
                        the alteration of institutions because they are accustomed to them, because
                        they have been long established in the country without suffering from them,
                        and perhaps may we offend no one!--because an easy and prosperous life in a
                        subtropical climate has taken from them a little of their moral energy and
                        their critical faculty-both a little inclined to rust under the conditions
                        of life in Egypt, and our remarks are addressed to the indolent but
                        well-meaning conservative.</p>
                    <p>The Capitulations have an interesting history. We cannot here discuss their
                        origin. Enough that the close of the crusading wars found Frankish consuls
                        established in many parts of the Levant, and that the Turkish conquerors of
                        the Empire of the East from the first recognised the advantages of per-
                        mitting the resident Latins and Franks to enjoy such civil conditions as
                        could be con- ciliated to their religious principles or prejudices. The most
                        inveterate zealots recognised the impossibility of undertaking the conver
                        sion or destruction of the strangers with any chance of permanent profit or
                        success. The wiser Sultans realised the importance of com- merce and their
                        viziers soon came to understand that it was only by the denial of privileges
                        and by a general persecution of the Europeans of the West residentin Ottoman
                        domi- nions that a European League against the East could be called into
                        being. Prudence and self-interest urged them to grant concessions, and the
                        European States, anxious for trade facilities and hoping to secure a certain
                        liberty for their subjects, were ready to meet them half way. In 1528
                        Soliman II. confirmed the treaty formerly drawn up between the Mameluke
                        Rulers of Egypt on the one hand and the French Consuls at Alexandria on the
                        other. In 1535 Jeon de la Forêt signed on behalf of Francis I. the treaty of
                        amity and commerce that has gone down to history under the name of the First
                        Capitulation' with the same Sultan. We need not mention the capitulations
                        and treaties that followed, the jurisdiction of the European Consuls
                        extended steadily, and the Powers showed themselves ever less inclined, as
                        the Turkish Empire grew relatively weaker, to renounce the rights which they
                        had acquired.</p>
                    <p>In 1890 Germany renounced the privileges Assured by the Capitulations but in
                        reality sacrificed nothing, owing to the operation of the most-favored
                        nation clause, and at present there is no likelihood of any modification of
                        the Capitulations in the parts of the Turkish Empire directly governed by
                        the Sultan. But Egypt, while de jure a part of the Ottoman Empire, has
                        reached a higher stage of development when the question may well be con-
                        sidered, and the most conservative of critics cannot deny that the country
                        has made enorm- ous progress since the days when the Franks of Alexandria
                        inhabited a single building, the fondique, which the police shut every night
                        and opened every morning. Under Mohamed Aly, Egypt from a purely military
                        became a partly industrial state, and though its indas- trial development
                        received several checks, it continued, and the numbers and importance of the
                        European population grew until it became evident that the consular
                        jurisdiction that had sufficed for a handful of Frankish merchants dwelling
                        in a khan was utterly inadequate to the needs of a population of over
                        100,000, and, owing to the multiplicity of jurisdictions and the diversity
                        of laws, was paralysing the com- merce which it had been designed to
                        protect. Then came the Mixed Tribunals, finally estab lished in 1874, which
                        brought the judicial function of the Consuls, as far as civil cases were
                        concerned, under the precise rules of international law. This establishment
                        of the Mixed Tribunals was in its essence an acknow ledgment that the
                        Capitulations were no longer applicable in their entirety to Egyptian
                        conditions, which have changed still more in the last 30 years. No one can
                        seriously con- tend that this diminution of the powers originally conferred
                        by treaty on the foreign Consuls has been harmful to the commercial
                        interests of the Europeans resident in Egypt and the undoubted success of
                        the change of 1874 should prevent the most conservative Europeans from
                        taking a gloomy view of the consequences of any further modification of the
                        Capitulations in 190-.</p>

                    <p>According to telegrams received from Paris, the negotiations in progress for

                        annuities where possible from 15 to 50 years, or even longer periods. The
                        sum required for this operation is reckoned at about eight millions
                        sterling, and it is said that it has been guaranteed by Sir Ernest Casual at
                        a rate equal to about 3 3/4%. As the rate of interest on the annuities is to
                        be 5 1/2%, the difference between 3 3/4% and 5 1/2% on eight millions will
                        remain as profit to be divided between the Crédit Fonder and the Daira

                        Boito Mefistofele. and in the drinking song from Bizet's Fair Maid of PeriX.
                        He sang with exceptional taste and charm and never pushed his voice, a very
                        pleasant "basse chantante," in attempting to gain effect. </p>

                        <p>The Golf Steward begs to remind members that the entries for Lbs golf
                            meeting dose at 12 noon to-morrow, 23rd inst. So far many members who
                            play golf constantly have not entered for any event. The Golf Steward
                            points out that the system of allowing the full handicap greatly
                            increases the chances of the ordinary or indifferent player, whilst
                            correspondingly minimizing those of the "scratch" man. He hopes
                            therefore that any long handicap players who are hesitating about
                            entering will now take the earliest opportunity of sending in their
                            names for some events. Aboukir Company.—Th e profit and lorn account for

                            per share, were paid in January last, and it is now proposed to declare
                            dividends for the past year of 7 per cent on both the Ordinary and
