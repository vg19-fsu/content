                    <head>THE RISING SUN.</head>
                    <p>Now that the war in the East is running to its close, we are finding time to
                        think about it. The victories of Japan, and the successes of this nation in
                        peace and war, have disturbed our conception of things. We have to revise
                        our outlook on the world, and readjust our angle of vision. Ideas which have
                        been traditional for centuries have been rudely shaken. It is long indeed
                        since the nations of the Teutonic and Celtio and Latin stocks have had even
                        to admit the possibility of rivalry on this planet. We were free to quarrel
                        among ourselves, secure in the conviction that the "inferior races" could
                        play no more than the part of interested spectators. That they should take a
                        hand in the game seemed almost as unnatural as it must have been to Gulliver
                        when he reached a land where the men drew the carriages and the horses sat
                        inside.</p>
                    <p>For centuries the East has been falling back before the West. Civilisation,
                        in our haughty conception, has had a special and limited meaning, Even
                        Stubbs, that catholic and comprehensive historian, thought that the only
                        peoples whose annals were really worth studying, were those corthern races
                        which had grafted the ethics of Christianity on the culture of Greece and
                        the jurisprudence of Rome. That, until the other day, was the orthodox
                        theory of human progress. Liberty, law, education, discovery, all the things
                        of which we are proud, are supposed to trace back<cb n="6"/> ultimately to
                        the union above mentioned. Without them there could be no true civilisa-:
                        tion; only a certain mechanical proficiency in material arts, like the
                        decorative work of the Arabs, or some mere fighting instinct, such as that
                        of the Turks or the Mongols. In war or peace the East could never be more
                        than second best, childish, barbario.</p>
                    <p>But the events of the past fourteen months give us pause, Here we have to do
                        with a people which has not and never has been, Christianised, Romanised, or
                        Hellenised, and which, apparently, has in its veins no single drop of the
                        white man's blood. And this people has only to set itself to the business to
                        show that in most of the things which we regard as the peculiar products of
                        our European civilisation, it is equal to the best of us. We have grown up
                        in the belief that in this rather vital. matter of warfare no Asiatic or
                        Oriental race could really hold its own with Europeans. We know now that
                        this axiom requires to be modified. But the Japanese have clearly other
                        qualities besides those of the soldier. Does civilisation mean a high
                        intellectual culture, the deepest feeling for art and beauty, the gilt
                        of-organisation, the love of order, decorum, discipline, and justice? All
                        these qualities and aptitudes the Japanese seem to possess, It was startling
                        for our critics to find that these distant islands had mastered the secrets
                        of colour and workmanship. The show of Japanese objects at the first French
                        Exhibition left upon our artists an impression which is not likely to be
                        effaced. If there had been no Japan there would have been no Whistler.</p>
                    <p>It is, however, on the ethical side that this revelation from the Far East is
                        most striking. We of Europe and America have always been able to comtort
                        ourselves with the. thought that morality, in its highest sense, was our own
                        especial prerogative. It is the white man's privilege. Yet we are confronted
                        with a non- Christian Eastern people, which is not only brave, but orderly,
                        temperate, generous and humane; which is said to have carried selfcontrol
                        and self-restraint to a pitch beyond the reckoning of our philosophers and
                        divines; and has developed the loftiest code of honor, patriotism, and
                        devotion to duty. We cherish the memory of a single hero, here and there,
                        like that Switzer of Sempach, who gathered the points of the hostile spears
                        into his breast to make an opening for his comrades. But whole battalions of
                        the common men of Nippon act like that. In the trenches before Port Arthur a
                        Japanese colonel calmly gave the command: "The honorable front rank will
                        throw itself on the enemy's bayonets." The honorable front rank instantly
                        obeyed. They flung themselves upon the spikes, and made a causeway with
                        their writhing bodies, over which their companions marched. A regiment of
                        Arnolds von Winkelried! And those who thus outrival the self-immolation of
                        the warrior ants and the Ghazis are not soulless or mindless machines, but
                        men of intelligence and sensibility. There must be a good many persons who
                        are asking themselves whether the ethical system which has produced such
                        extraordinary results is not worth study. The Russians believe in their
                        faith as no other Christian people do, unless it be the Spaniards. And if we
                        look at the recent history of Russia and Spain on the one side, and then at
                        Japan on the other, the result is a little disturbing. We remember that at
                        the beginning of the New Era the Mikado sent a commission of statesmen to
                        study the institutions of Europe and America. The commissioners recommended
                        an adaptation of the British Navy, Prussian finance, American education, and
                        so on; but they reported that no reproduction of our religious or ethical
                        systems was worth considering. In these matters Japan had nothing to learn
                        from the West. Perhaps she may have something to teach..</p>

                    <p>In another column of to-day's issue we publish the report of the directors of
                        the Egyptian Markets, Limited, for the past year. Although the results of
                        the year's trading may be considered somewhat disappointing, owing to the
                        fact that all the cattle markets have been closed during the year to horned
                        cattle, still we think the shareholders will appreciate, the efforts of
                        their directors under such trying circumstances. Not only have their efforts
                        to decrease working expenses been so far successful, butthey have also given
                        up over £1,500 of their fees, thus making a total revenue for the year of
                        £18,580. Further, the shareholders are to be congratulated on the extension
                        of the concession for a further term of ten years. All things considered,
                        the Egyptian Markets should now have weathered the storm, and be entering on
                        a period of prosperity.</p>

                    <head>IS THE ASSOUAN DAM SAFE ?</head>
                    <p>A PLEA FOR OBSERVATION AND DELAY.</p>
                    <p>THE NILE DAM AND ITS TASK.</p>
                    <p>The question of raising the Nile dam at Assouan is keenly exercising the
                        professional mind. Engineers, more especially those who have had experience
                        of large water schemes, are divided as to whether or not the present barrage
                        ought to be taxed with extra work, and it is reassuring to find a voice
                        raised here and there on the side of prudence and delay. We have interviewed
                        Mr. Ewing Matheson, a wellknown member of the Institute of Civil Engineers,
                        and while expressing confidence in the united experience of the chief
                        experts in this branch. of the profession-men like Messrs. Mansergh,
                        Hawksley, and Bateman-he said Sir Benjamin Baker would be well advised to
                        lengthen the period of observations before the present structure of the dam
                        was added to in any way.</p>
                    <p>"The Nile dam," said Mr. Matheson to our representative, "was no doubt
                        designed for its present height of water, with a margin of safety, and to
                        raise it to a considerable height means reviving the old question of
                        flooding the island of Phila over again, and matters of public safety that
                        are much more important. It is impossible to foretell or conceive the damage
                        which would be done if the dam were overtaxed."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Matheson cited the disastrous floods at Sheffield and Johnstown,
                        Pennsylvania, as instances of insufficient planning. "I visited Johnstown,"
                        he said, "twelve months after the catastrophe, and saw traces even then of
                        that terrible flood. Fifteen miles away from the scene of the burst, there
                        were locomotives swept aside and overturned, and it was all due to
                        insufficient calculation, added to the usual light-heartedness of the
                        Americans in their constructive undertakings.</p>

                    <head>THE FACTORS OF DESTRUCTION.</head>
                    <p>The two main considerations in the proper working of a dam of this kind are
                        the rush of water and the height-the 'height' being a teclinical expression
                        for the hydrostatic pressure. It is the rush of water which creates what we
                        call the scour, or attrition along the conduits or subterranean passages;
                        and it was with a view to preserve them that, in the Assouan case, they were
                        paved for a certain portion. Sir Benjamin Baker's recent visit was to report
                        on the working out of these calculations, and as a result this pavement is
                        to be extended. But it will be a matter for the most anxious consideration
                        before the dam is raised, as projected, merely to increase the area of
                        irrigation purposes. Far better wait another year or two, and estimate wear
                        and tear upon the present construction."</p>
                    <p>"Are there any precedents!" we asked. "Yes, of one kind or another," was the
                        reply, "and the experience in this class of work among British engineers all
                        over the world, as well as in work under British supervision, fortifies us
                        against any novel theories or experiments. There have been just sufficient
                        failures to bring them up to the mark, and in the construction of nasonry
                        dams no possible precaution is now neglected, even where, as in the case of
                        the present construction at Leeds, the volume of water is not to be compared
                        with that of the Nile.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>THE OVERWHELMING RISKS. "Everything, depends upon the margin of safety as
                        allowed originally. It must have entered into the minds of the designers
                        that the dam might be raised or thickened later on; and it remained then to
                        see that the dovetailing of the rock foundations were sufficient for any
                        increase in superincumbent weight. Personally, I should advise waiting for
                        another year or two, as I have said, botore considering additions involving
                        perhaps 6lbs. extra pressure to the square inch of surface. The advantages
                        to be gained are dwarfed into insignificance compared with the awful extent
                        of the danger incurred."-"Pall Mall Gazette.")</p>

                        Cathedral, Pietro Magri's requiem mass being sung by the brothers of the
                        Christian Schools, Archbishop Briante officiating. All the clerical orders
                        of the city were represented, and grouped near the high altar were H. E. the
                        Governor, several of the consuls, headed by the French Consul, etc.</p>
                    <p>The service was of the most impressive character, and the large congregation,
                        it could be seen, was deeply affected. The splendid Miseremini mei
                        especially was rendered with supreme pathos. At the close of the requiem,
                        the celebrant, attended by his clergy, left the altar preceded by the
                        crucifix and acolytes, and went towards the catafalque for the absolution,
                        the time the Christian Brothers sang Libera me.</p>
                    <p>This ceremony over the Archbishop went to St. Mark's chapel, where the mortal
                        remains of the late Archbishop Bonfigli are laid, and where a monument to
                        his memory has been erected. Mr. Moriondo, president of the memorial
                        committee, here address" ed the Archbishop in Italian, handing over the
                        memorial to his lordship's care. Archbishop Briante replied, thanking the
                        committee for their beautiful gift to the church, which would always receive
                        the most tender and reverent</p>
                    <p>care.</p>
                    <p>The parchment containing a record of the ceremony and the names of the clergy
                        connected with the church, was then signed by the consuls present and read
                        by the Pro-Vicar General Amadio Amato, to whose initiative and untiring
                        efforts the erection of the monument is mainly due, and who deserves the
                        thanks of the Catholic community.</p>

                    <head>THE THEATRE FIRE.</head>
                    <p>The fire which caused the destruction of the Abbas Helmy Theatre is generally
                        believed to have been due to the same cause as the other recent great
                        conflagration in the Old Bourse Palace, namely, the fusing of an electric
                        wire. The scene of the fire still attracts large numbers of spectators, but
                        no idea can be obtained of the ruin brought by the fire from an external
                        inspection, as the walls of the building are intact. It is only on entering
                        what was the auditorium that one is able to grasp the extent of the
                        devastating work of the flames. The theatre is absolutely burnt out except
                        the walls. The force of the fire is evidenced by the state of the iron
                        pillars which used to support the boxes. They are nearly all cracked by the
                        fierceness of the heat.</p>
                    <p>The only thing left untouched by the fire and unspoilt by the water was a
                        large portraitof the actress Bellincioni in the entrance hall. In every
                        other respect the theatre is an abomination of desolation."</p>

                    <head>THE COLLAPSE IN THE ATTARIN</head>
                    <p>The collapse of a house in the Attarin quarter of Alexandria on Wednesday was
                        not, luckily, attended with any loss of life. The collapse was due to a
                        neighbour excavating by the side of the house in order to make the
                        foundations of a new building. This man texcavated to a depth of at least
                        two and a half metres underneath the foundations of the house. The result
                        was that the house collapsed entirely and two persons were buried in the
                        ruins. One of them was buried under some metres of rubbish and stones and it
                        was ten. minutes before the Fire Brigade managed to get down to him. They
                        bared his head and gave him first-aid, feeding him on whisky and caffeine.
                        It took another full hour to liberate his body, which was severely
                        braised.</p>
                    <p>A somewhat humorous incident took place when the Fire Brigade had cleared
                        away the earth from the man's head. He was a native Moslem and refused to
                        take the caffeine (Shorbah Ahmar) but asked "Mafish Whisky 1" The
                        Superintendent of the Fire Brigade at once sent a shawish of the police to
                        buy a tumbler of whisky and the contents were poured down the man's mouth,
                        greatly to his relish. He only remarked, "All right, work away," for his
                        arms and entire body were still pinned by the earth. Soon afterwards he was
                        again offered caffeine but refused it, and asked for more whisky, and by the
                        time his body had been extricated, which operation had taken an hour and a
                        quarter, he had consumed a full bottle of whisky. When the stretcher on
                        which he lay was being raised to take him to the bospital he asked whether
                        he could have any more!</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MARKETS.</head>
                    <p>REPORT FOR THE YEAR.</p>
                    <p>The directors of the company in their report for the year ended 31st
                        December, 1904 state that for the whole of the year all the markets have, by
                        order of the Government, been closed to horned cattle in consequence of the
                        cattle plague. The gross receipts of the company for the year were:-trom
                        cattle marketa, £16,104; general markets £9,138; abattoirs, £923, total,
                        £26,165, which, together with sundry receipts, makes a grand total of
                        £26,602. This gives an average per market per week of £214s. 7d. for cattle
                        markets (including abattoirs), and of £1 9s. 3d. for general markets. Total
                        £4 38. 10d. Consi derable further economies have been effected during the
                        year in the working of the marketa. the total cost of which has been reduced
                        to £16,035, or £4,537 less than in 1903. In consideration of the heavy
                        losses sustained by the company by the closing of the cattle markets, the
                        directors have agreed to forego their fees for the year under review to the
                        extent of £1,525. The trustees for the debenture holders, the Hon. Alfred
                        Lyttelton and Arthur Wagg, Esq., have also agreed to forego their fees to a
                        corresponding extent.</p>
                    <p>The directors are gratified to report that the Egyptian Government was in
                        1904 pleased to grant a ten years' extension of the concession, as some
                        compensation for the losses sustained by the company in consequence of the
                        closing of the markets. In consequence of the extension of the Government
                        concession, a revision of the sinking fand for the redemption of the share
                        capital has been effected, which in fature years will result in a saving to
                        the company of £1,193 per annum, with effect from the 17th Novem ber, 1904.
                        Under the old arrangement the interest per annum upon the debentures of the
                        company and the share capital sinking fund premium combined amounted to
                        £7,444. Under the revised arrangement they will amount to £6,251, effecting
                        a saving per annum of £1,193. After meeting charges for administration and
                        working, the net revenue for the year from all sources amounts to £10,567
                        0s. 6d. which, together with the balance of £8,015 4s. 11d. brought forward
                        from 1903, makes a total of £18,582 58. 5d. to be dealt with. After payment
                        of the annual premium for the amortisation of share and debenture capital,
                        £5,028 28. 7d., and debenture interest, £4,459 11s. 8d., a balance of £9,094
                        118. 2d. remains for disposal. Having given the matter their most careful
                        consideration, the directors have decided, in view of the fact that the best
                        season of 1905 has already been lost, not to recommend the payment of a
                        dividend until the re-opening of the cattle markets has been authorised by
                        the Government. The abattoirs continue to show satisfactory and progressive
                        results. The company's share of the net earnings from this source amounted
                        to £922 12s. 5d. The total number now opened is fifteen and Government
                        proposes to build others during 1905, of which five are under
                        construction.</p>
                    <p>As in the previous year, the directors and staff have done everything in
                        their power to assist the efforts of Government during the year 1904 to
                        entirely eradicate the cattle plague from Egypt. The recognition by Govern-
                        ment, in the extension of the concession, of the losses sustained by the
                        conpany, is fully appreciated, but the directors, in view of the length of
                        time the markets have been closed, still hope that further considerations
                        will be granted. The directors wish to draw the attention of the proprietors
                        to the fact that, notwithstanding the serious losses incurred by the closing
                        of the markets, it has been possible, by the utmost economy and by
                        abandoning their fees and those of the trustees, to meet all working and
                        other expenses. A good deal has been done in the way of negotiations towards
                        sub-letting the markets, but it is not considered opportune to press the
                        conclusion of contracts until the cattle markets are reopened. The directors
                        report the resignation of Lieut.-Col. E.L. Marryat, R.E, from the Board.
                        Major W.I. Le Breton has been elected in his place In accordance with the
                        articles of association, two directors of the company, Major W.I. Le Breton
                        and Mr. W. O. Joseph, retire at this meeting and, being eligible, offer
                        themselves for re-election..</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES COMPANY.</head>
                    <p>In our issue of the 4th inst., we stated that the Sucreries Company had
                        decided to pay a dividend of 13% for the year 1903-4, i.e., 5% already paid
                        as interim dividend and 8% after the general meeting of 12th inst. Our Cairo
                        Correspondent writes to rectify this information. It appears from his
                        interview with one of the directors of the company that the board intends to
                        propose to the next general meeting a dividend of 8%, of which 5% was paid
                        on October 81 last. The balance to be distributed on April 30 will thus be
                        3%, if, as is likely, the shareholders adopt the proposition of their
                        board.</p>
                    <p>It is to be noted that the financial year 1903-</p>
                    <p>4 was closed before the present rise in the price of sugar, and that it had
                        to defray the exceptional expenditure arising from the taking over by this
                        company of the old Daïra sugar factories. The current year will therefore
                        reap' the profit from the rise in sugar and the increase in the production
                        consequent on the purchase of the Daïra factories.</p>

                    <p>A Zeitoun correspondent writer:- May I be allowed through the medium of your
                        columns to draw the attention of the Railway authorities to a state of
                        affairs which has been, and still is, an intolerable nuisance as well as a
                        sanitary danger, viz., the presence of dogs in the first-class carriages on
                        the Pont Limoun-Marg railway,-dogs, moreover, not merely lying on the floor,
                        but reposing on the seats. Even a clean and healthy dog is objec tionable in
                        a railway carriage; how much more so are dogs, dirty, mangy, and densely
                        popula ted, such as are constantly seen on the line in question?</p>
                    <p>In any civilised country this would not be allowed, as there, the health and
                        comfort of the passengers are the first consideration of the Railway
                        authorities, which does not seem to be the case on this particular branch of
                        the Egyptian State Railways. I feel sure, however, that this matter has only
                        to be brought to the notice of the responsible Railway officials for them to
                        take the necessary steps to put a stop to this reprehensible practice.</p>

                    <p>The Tigris enters its delta at Baled, near thesite of the ancient Opis, where
                        were situated the famous weirs of antiquity and which were 'described by

                        above the water's edge of the Tigris. The conglomerate dips under the
                        allurvum of the Tigris below Beled and its termination was in Probability a
                        great cataract near Beled known .ally as "Sadd Nimrud," or Nimrod's dam.
                        'file Nahrwan and Dijail canals look out from above these weire^ .The
                        Nahrwan canal was ruined by the Tigris changing its course, and the
                        undermining and sweeping away of these great cataracts sealed the ruin of
                        all the irrigation systems fed by the Tigris. From Beled to Bagdad the
                        Tigris has a length of about 110 kilometres, and a width of from 4
                        kilometres to 350 'metres. Where the river is wide, it flows over a bed of
                        shingle and has a velocity pf some 6 to 7 kilometres per hour. Navigation by
                        sailing boats is impossible against the current.</p>
                    <p>From Bagdad to Gurnn,whore tho Tigris and Euphrates meet, the river has a
                        length of 740 kilometres. The distance from Gnrna to Basra is 60 kilometres,
                        and 100 kilometres further on is the Persian Gulf. Tho distances along the
                        Tigris are therefore as follows . . ' From Beled to tho Sea J 1010

                        <p>To rta Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—In reply to "Grammarian's"
                            lette.r in yesterday's "Gazette," I hive to inform him:— .(1) Not long
                            before reviewing Dirr's Arabic Grammar, the "Gazette" published my
                            opinion of another grammar of the classical language, which was most
                            flattering and which was afterwards shared by the editor of a well-known
                            literary Arabic periodical inJJairo in his review of it (2) ' Before
                            sending in mf artiole on Dirr's grammar I gave the book to a native
                            friend (who is a competent Arabio scholar) to read and return to me with
                            his opinion. He brought it after a few days and told me what he thought
                            of it in fewer but severer words than I used. I then gave him my article
                            to read and he approved of every word I said. Moreover, I have not yet
                            met one who knew the book and did not share my opinion of it (3) Since
                            sending my article to the "Gazette" 1 have learned that the book had
                            been sent to an Euglish gentleman who is a well- known Arabic scholar,
                            but although he refused to review it he marked here and there what he
                            considered flagrant errors. The reason of his refusal is therefore not
                            far to seek. . (4) I confirm every word I said in my review, but I
                            cannot enter into any discussion with one who makes the ridioulous
                            statement that it is grammatically correct to say el ingi- lyz tayiba
                            because he means the English as a nation, and pretends that most of the
                            other mistakes are obvious slips. (5) "Grammariau" has the fault of more
                            than one other resident in the country who no sooner- picks up? a few
                            words of Arabio (and before he could write a sentence correctly without
                            the aid of some one else) than be rushes.to the press with a wonderful
                            grammar of his own. It would have been better for "Grammarian" to study
                            the language for many more years before venturing to write a book
                            dealing with it (6) "Grammarian'' will have to get all the , mistakes I
                            pointed out, and many more, cor- ; need before the book ceases to be
                            called a . "queer'' grammar.. As regards his personal reference to me,
                            there is no need for me to reply, as this sort of controversial method
                            is beneath contempt.— Yours very truly,</p>

                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich in the Chancery Divi- sion on,Tahsday w§ek continued the
                        hearing of the notion in which'Dr. Robert William Eelkin Rued the Palmerston
                        Industrial and Finance Corporation, Ltd., and Mr. Alfred -Bridge, a company
                        promoter, of-15, Cockspur-street, W., claiming rescission of an agreement to
                        take 800 shares in the Sudan Exploration, Ltd., and a declaration that
                        defendants were liable to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of all expen-
                        ses incurred by him in relation to the transac- tion, or in the alternative
                        damages for alleged misrepresentation. The corporation denied that its
                        policy or business was controlled by Bridge, and did not admit that the
                        representations alleged to have been made by him were made on behalf of the
                        corporation or with its know- ledge. The.defendant Bridge pleaded that if he
                        did. make any representations or statements concerning the present or future
                        value of the shares they were bona fide expressions of opi- nion. Defendant
                        Bridge counter-claimed againit the plaintiff for alleged misrepresentation.—
                        Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K. C. and Mr. J; H. Simmons appeared for plaintiff,
                        Mr. Ashton Cross for the Palmerston Corporation, and Mr. W. J. L Ambrose for
                        Mr. Bridge. Plaintiff, continuing his evidence, said that up to the issue of
                        the writ in this action he had never received a certificate for or transfer
                        of the 800 shares in the . Sudan Exploration, Ltd.</p>
                    <p>In cross-examination by Mr. Ashton Cross, for the Palmerston Corporation,
                        plaintiff said he knew the property which the Siidan Explo- ration had been
                        formed to acquire. From his knowledge of the country witness believed the
                        company's property to be valuable. Ho wa3 anxious to g|t some Sudan sbures
                        if he could pay cash for them. The 10$. nominal shares could not be obtained
                        for less than £1. Ho Btill believed in tho success of the Sudan Company if
                        it was well managed. Mr. Ashton Cross said he agreed that the Palmerston
                        Corporation sold the shares to Dr. Felkip and those shares had been
                        delivered. Plaintiff, >n auswer to counsel, said ho be- lieved that the 800
                        shares were in the Sudan Company's hands' for transfer. In cross-examination
                        by ' Mr. Ambrose, plaintiff said he understood that the Palmerston
                        Corporation was to put the shares on the mar- ket at-£2 when the
                        pooling-arrangement came to an end. He always understood that Bridge was
                        actiug for the Palmerston Corporation. This concluded plaintiff's case, and
                        Mr. Ashton Cross, submitting that ho case had been made out against the
                        corporation, called Mr. Allred Bridge, who described himself as a director
                        of. the Palmerston Corporation, of which,he said,tho plaintiff also beoamo a
                        direc- tor. When the question of the Sudan Explora- tion shares was uuder
                        discussion, plaintiff said that if he went into the matter ho should want a
                        share of the profits, and witness then told him he had better become a
                        director. Plaintiff, said witness, worked hand-in-hand with him in the Sudan
                        matter, and advised the corporation to take up the shares. Witness denied
                        that he ever made any representations to induce plaintiff to go into the
                        share transaction, and he said that Dr. Felkin must have understood the
                        whole transaction.</p>
                    <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawrence, witness said that he was a company promoter,
                        and prior to his going to Cockspur-street he carried on business at 8,
                        Union-court, FC., where he promoted a number of companies. May I take it
                        that, all the companies you promoted come to grief?—No.—Witness men- tioned
                        the Pan-African Syndicate, Ltd., and the London and Provincial Dairy Company
                        as suocossful promotions. Witness denied that at the time he
                        left'Union-courtoxocutions were out against him at his office and at his
                        house at Surbiton. Wore there any baukruptcy petitions presented against you
                        ?—Yes. May I tako it that altogether 8, Union-court, got too hot for yon at
                        tho time you migrated to the West End ?—No, not at all.—Witness said he
                        sometimes advertised for directors willing to invest It was not true to
                        suggest that witness was the Palmerston Corporation. He agreed that there
                        was no entry in the mi- nute-books concerning the agreement with tho
                        plaintiff. At the date of the signing of the bill by the plaintiff witness
                        admitted that the only transfer of Sudan shares to the Palmer ston
                        Corporation was one for 600 shqres. They had, however,' made arrangements to
                        acquirejurther shares.</p>

                        <p>The abovo teams met at Abbassieh xm Wednesday last. Both teams hold a
                            good record. The K.R.R's, it seems, have not been defeated since 1902,
                            whereas the representatives of the Shamrook have only been beaten onoe
                            in some sixtyodd matches,60 a good game was expected. The pitch was in
                            splendid order as the Irishmen took the field in the following order :
                            Goal, Dadgeon ; backs, Shanks and Reid ; halves, Millar, Nixon, and
                            Smyth ; forwards, Todd, Hutton, Cunningham, Fallon, and Walsh. The
                            Rifles won the spin of the coin and defended the city goals. There would
                            be almost 900 spectators present when Cunningham commenced operations..
                            The opening minutes proved sensational as the Inuiskillings bom- barded
                            the Rifles' goal for fully five minutes. The custodian clearing the
                            Rifles now broke away per Bibbleton, but Smyth robbed and returned. Todd
                            getting possession centred well but Fallon sent behind. On the kick-off
                            tho Rifles took play towards Dudgeon, but the latler was not to be
                            oanght napping and cleared in Gillispie's best style. At this stage the
                            referee (a sergeant of the K.KR.'s) had occasion to retire owing to a
                            misunderstanding of the roles, Mr. MoKenzie, Royal Engineers, filling
                            the vacanoy (amid cheers). On play being resumed Cunningham got away and
                            sent across to Todd, who outwitted two opponents and seut strongly into
                            goal, where Fallon headed over the bar. Flay remained in midfield, until
                            Fallon broke away, but when in a good position ho was! fouled by
                            Bibbleton. A fight ensued, both players being oantioned. The Rifles'
                            right wiug now got away but Smyth intercepted and returned. Some very
                            spirited play 'took place around the Rifles' goal. At last, however, the
                            custodian cleared. The Irishmen were now ' having the best of matters
                            and a shot of Cunningham's deserved a better fate. A free against the
                            Green and Buff Brigade proved unproductive. It was close on half-timo as
                            Hutton gave the Dark Greens' defence some trouble. Half-time now arrived
                            with the repre- seratives of the Shamrock pressing for all they were
                            worth,but there was no score yet on either side.</p>
                        <p>After the usual refreshments both teams took tho field. The first thing
                            noticeable was a great sprint by Todd. The ball, however, found touch.
                            The Rifles now took play in hand, but Smith robbed the right wing -time
                            after time. A corner to the Rifles looked ridrie too rosy for the Green
                            and Buff Brigade, HoWeker Nixon cleared and the InniskUliugs were seen
                            fio advantage. Walsh, however, ran the ball ovet tho liue. On the kick
                            off Bibbleton got away, on his own, but Smith was on his track aneb
                            blocked his passage once more. Not to be deniod, the Rifles got down
                            towards Dudgeon and scored, but Johnny Bibbleton was given offside. On
                            resuming, Millar got away on his own, and alter dodging a couple of
                            opponents sent across to Cunningham, who had a good try for goal. The
                            Rifles now pulled themselves togother and worked their way down towards
                            Dudgeon but Nixon and Smith were not to be beaten so easily and play was
                            once more trans- ferred, when Hutton got well away and gave to Todd, who
                            aont in a "daisy cutter" to tho Custodian, who fell on the ball but too
                            late, as Fallou gut the ball at his toe and into the net it went,
                            drawing first blood for the Innis- killings amidst deafening cheers. Oa
                            the ball being centred the K.RR's got away but' Reid returned the ball.
                            Great was the excitement that now prevailed (at this stage Mion was
                            injured and had to retire). Both teams were now playing a most
                            determined and very hard game. If anything, the Inniskillingswere having
                            tho best of matters at this stage. The shield holders were playing a
                            fine combination game. It was a treat to watoh the five forwards play so
                            woll considering tho circumstances under which they were placod. It was
                            now wearing up to full'time as Walsh missed the much desired spot by
                            inches. Shortlyafterthereferee's whistle sounded for full time, leaving

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. They are as
                        follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>Southern Italy</head>
                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE I. SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                    <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to Palermo and
                        down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and Catania. TAORMINA is one of
                        the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station
                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman

                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE II. NORTHERN ITALY. Italian Lakes Italian &amp; French
                        Riviera</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
