                    <head>ALEXANDRIA IMPROVEMENTS</head>
                    <p>The approaching completion of the new ses wall and the pavement and carriage
                        road, 4 metres wide, that will afford Alexandrians no excellent an
                        opportunity of enjoying the see air on the new premenade, naturally draw
                        attention to the question of the disposal of the building sites on the
                        extensive <!-- cannot read word --> that goes by the name of the New Quay.
                        We are informed that the plans for the new roads that will be constructed,
                        and the plans into which the land will be divided and subdivided, are a'
                        ready being prepared, and that very shortly the first portion will be ready
                        for disposal. We regret t hear that in all probability it will b flared for
                        sale and not let on building leases. Should this course be finally decided
                        upon we feel sure that before very long it wjlj be recog- <cb n="6"/> uised
                        that a great mistake has been made — One that cannot be rectified in the
                        future and mast be accepted for all time. This is so important a matter that
                        pause may welt be given before the irrevocable step is taken. So valuable an
                        area of building land ought never to pass out of the hands of its rightful
                        owners, the citizens of Alexandria. Their interests are entrusted to the
                        Municipality, a body supposed to represent them and elected by those
                        qualified to vote, for that very purpose. The fact that the interests are
                        committal to a small delegation and that the Press is excluded from the
                        deliberations of this small and select party, should not be lost sight of;
                        such considerations do not tend to increase public confidence in our City
                        Fathers. Apparently they themselves are somewhat uncertain as to whether
                        tiny are right in selling the land, for we are assured that only just so
                        much will at first be offered as will provide capital for needed
                        improvements in the city. Why, with the borrowing powers they possess,
                        should not the building sites be let on lease and money be borrowed on the
                        security of the ground rents? If this course were adopted there would be no
                        necessity for even a portion of the property to pass out of the hands of the
                        community, and the increase of value that must accrue as building after
                        building is erected and occupied (at a consequent profit to the earlier
                        investor) will allow of an increased rental being obtained at the
                        termination of the various leases. </p>
                    <p>We, by no means, urge the letting of the land on such terms as would result
                        in the surrender of all buildings erected oh it when the lease fell in,
                        without compensation to the leaseholder. Such conditions are bad enough when
                        enforced by private landowners, and probably the time is not far distant
                        when in England the enfranchisement of the leaseholder will be legalised and
                        the tenant no longer be left unable to claim compensation for the
                        improvements made upon the property. A lease granted for, say, 50 years and
                        renewable at the end of the term at a rental commensurate with the increased
                        (or decreased) value of the property at the time at the leaseholder's option
                        should on such favourable terms secure a good ground rent even from
                        investors who as pioneers naturally hope for more advantageous terms than
                        later comers would get in a few years' time. For many years their enterprise
                        would be rewarded 'by the continually increasing value of their leas while
                        no injustice would be done to them by requiring an increased ground rent
                        when, at the end of the term, the leases expired. We know full well the
                        difficulty of arousing public opinion even on questions vitally concerning
                        the well-being of the citizens. Whether it is the fact that the business
                        portion of the community, cosmopolitan as it is, is really Incapable of
                        taking the interest that Englishmen in general feel in the local matters
                        connected with their places of residence, or whether these foreigners feel
                        that they have only a passing interest in the city which will cease when
                        the) have made their fortunes and are free to return to their own lands,
                        certain it is that no resentment is expressed, even at so glaring an
                        injustice as the exclusion of the Press from the deliberations of the
                        governing body. surely in a matter of the urgency of that which we have been
                        discussing some strong hand should make its power felt, especially as it is
                        understood that Lord Cromer is favourable to the adoption of the leasehold
                        system, little as it is understood as yet in this country. What better
                        opportunity could be given than the present for it to be successfully pat
                        into operation. </p>
                    <p>While on the subject of the new quay we mast express the hope that on the
                        reservation of space for the erection of Government and Municipal buildings
                        which it is intended to make, ample provision will be made, not only for
                        needs which can be foreseen as likely bat for others which may arise at no
                        distant date. Too frequently public bodies have to pay dearly for a lack of
                        foresight, and lost opportunities seldom return, as they have found to their
                        cost While thinking it no part of their duty to provide for the requirements
                        of future generations tiny neglect to consider sufficiently the possible
                        developments of the immediate future, with the result that in a few years
                        they fi id that they have lamentably underestimated the growth of the public
                        wants. Alexandria is growing so rapidly that the most liberal allowance
                        should be made not only for the extersion of the building it is intended to
                        erect bat for the space required for others not at present contemplated. The
                        area available is BO extensive that this can be done without in the
                        slightest degree interfering with the fullest development of the property
                        for many years to come while the reserved space would, from its situation,
                        be rea i y <!-- this is how it is written on the original print --> disposed
                        of at a greatly enhanced value, if needs be. </p>

                        <p>It appears that the late Baker Pacha, whore death was announced in

                            many years ago from the service of the Egyptian Government. He was an
                            officer in the P. and O. Company. During the Mutiny he gained a V. C.
                            for carrying despatches in the face of the enemy. He held high rank in
                            the Egyptian Police and resided at lex andria. He was cousin of the

                            Vectis, the Orient Pacific Line's S.S. Ophir and S.S. Orient, Dr. Lonn's
                            Argonaut, the Hamburg-Amerika liners Meteor and Moltke, and Mr. Clark's
                            specially chartered White Star liner Arabic. The tourists, who make use
                            of these boats are mostly Boglish, Germans and Americans, especially the
                            latter, who find these trips most convenier t Of course in such places
                            as Palestine, where hotels and accommodation are comparatively
                            limited-for example there are only about 700 beds for tourists at
                            Jerusalem-it is easy to understand that from the 8th to 13th proxo. when
                            there will be 500 trippers by the Arabic. and from the 12th to 16th
                            proxo., when the Moltke will bring about 25 visitors to he Holy City,
                            the leiserely inclined tourist would do well not to arrive in Palestine
                            before the 15th March.</p>

                    <p>Only the interest actually recovered during any financial year can. be taken
                        into account in making up the balance sheet. According'y only the interest
                        actually collected viz: £432,717.9.11, has been carried to the credit of
                        profit and loss account for 1905, whereas the interest acorned amounted to
                        £89,627.15.6 in addition to this amount.</p>
                    <p>At the end of 1905 the overdue loans for the year amounted to £68,400 and the
                        overdue interest to £48,660 The greater part of these arrears was
                        outstanding in the Behera province and in the northern parts of Ghar ieh and
                        Dakahlieb. Of this amount over LB. 30,000 has been collected by the Bank up
                        to Feb. 8th. Owing to the lateness of the cotton drops in these parts the
                        payment to the fellaheen against sale of their cotton was naturally delayed
                        and hence the bank was late in collecting its money. The directors are glad
                        to be able to report that the work of the bank has. continued to increase
                        steadily, £37.960 having been put out in loans during 1905 against
                        £2,497.300 in 1904. The total number of loans put out in 1905 was 106,373
                        and the total number outstanding on the 31st December 1905' was 185,530,
                        amounting to over £5,900 OCO, as against 134.207, amounting to a little over
                        £1.000.000, on the 31st December 1904; of these 185.530 21,29 are A loans

                        of the £5,0 0,0 0 of capital authoris ed in 1904. At the extraordinary
                        general meeting of the bank on the 18th of May, 1905, it was resolved to
                        increase the hare cxpital to £3,740,000 by the issue of 24,0 0 new ordi-
                        nary shares of £5 each and to increase the debentare capital from £, 00,000
                        to £6,570,00. This was duly sauctioned by the Government, subject to the
                        condition that from the beginning of the year succeeding that at the end of
                        which the loans outstanding should have resched L.E.7,000,000 the maximum
                        rate of interest charged to fellaheen should be reduced-to 8% for both old

                        PATRONISED</head>
                    <p>All yesterday morning an energetic bevy of Cairo ladies were busying
                        themselves in the large multi-coloured tent erected for the great annual
                        Fête de Bienfaisance. Light stalls of trellis wood had been erected inside
                        the canvas walls, and trails of bignonia, roses and other lovely flowers had
                        been entwined round the stalls set out with all their tempting good... In
                        the centre stood the circular kiosk ablaze with gorgeous flowers which shed
                        their sweet ness through the air, in one corner was displayed a plethora of
                        dainty hats, surrounded by a host of envious and perplexed femininity. Two
                        stalls appealed to lovers of children and the tiny tots themselves, one
                        reserved for general toys and the other given over entirely to a beauty show
                        of surely the sweetest dolla that ever gladdened a child-mother's eye. Girl
                        dolls, boy dolls, fairy dolls, and baby dolls were hanging there: many a
                        nursery family will be richer for the addition of one or more of these
                        welcome little strangers. At the end of the tent appeared the well-stocked
                        buffet, with inscriptions banging round to reassure the timid that P.T. 5
                        would buy them the cup of tes or coffee or stronger drink for which their
                        thirsty souls hankered. For those not averse to trying their lack there were
                        the tables given over to the endeavours of the p tit chevaux and tourniquet,
                        simple amusements surely but always certain to be well patronized. Objets
                        dart and bric-a-brao of all sorts could be found at various corners, pretty
                        pottery, and silken bags and tea ocsies and the like Enor mous lam abades,
                        lacky charms, bits of dainty silver, le dernier cri in belts and bookles,
                        useful housewives, and a thousand and one other seductive trifles hang in
                        close proximity, and all of the beat and fairest of Cairo who were not among
                        the tireless sellers were to be found among the eager crowd who came to
                        leave their money to the advancement of the various charities.</p>
                    <p>Money changed handa quickly during the afternoon, though we noticed more than
                        one rueful face when the smiling ladies pooketed the money tentatively
                        offered them with no thought of returning the change due to the boyers. It
                        must have been hard work to refuse the advances of the pretty flwer-sellers
                        as they be-ieged the brave men who entered alone and unprotected. Prince
                        Mohamed Aly and Prince Said Halim were fair game and when last. notioad were
                        being hauled off in triumph to the tea tables, by the daintiest and trimmest
                        of serving girls in a short stiff silk frook of pale pink with fiohn at her
                        neck, and an apology for a cap amid her curls. The ladie of the harem paid
                        an early visit to the bazaar before the general public were admitted, and
                        from what one saw by half-past four there would not be much left on the
                        stalls by closing time. The hat stall, presided over by Lady Mollwraith,
                        Mrs. Carton de Wiart, and Mme J. Cattani, was especially well patronized,
                        and there were many competitors for the dainty and chic chapeau which might
                        have been sold two or three times over. If these ladies would only start a
                        salon of their own we fear the profesional milliners of Cairo would have no
                        hing more to do. The crowd around the petit chevaux table quite justified
                        its being. Mne de Martino persuading many people to try their luck, and the
                        tables doing the rest.</p>

                    <p>On Wednesday evening (writes a correspondent) a very merry party met át
                        Kasr-el-Nil, on the occssion of the Sappers' first annual dance. The
                        attendance was good, and at no time was the room too crowded. Everybody
                        Reeped in the very best of spirits. The very latest dances were instituted
                        and quite caught on. Sapper Newton took a prominent part in assisting the
                        band, and helped to make things" most enjoyable with his "popular airs." On-
                        has to look very far back to the last dance given by the Sappers; in fact,
                        this was, I think, the maiden effort of the 2nd Company in Cairo. The
                        organisers are to be congratulated on the success of their efforts. Dancing
                        continued till 4 a.m on Thursday. The M. C. and his committee deserve great
                        praise for the able manner in which everything was carried out. It was very
                        noticeable that not one lady was allowed to "wallflower" a single dance,
                        Everybody seemed to bave come to dance, and dance they did; and when the
                        time came to break up all were of the opinion that a most pleasant and
                        enjoyable evening had been spent, and trasted it would be the forerunner of

                    <dateline>Helouan, Wednesday.</dateline>
                    <p>The name of the Spanish subject who at tacked Dr. W. von Grabowski, of the
                        Villa Savoy Pension, near the railway station on Mouday, is Autoine Sancho.
                        It appears that he had been engaged as cook by the month, and that he left
                        before the end of his term. When he met Dr. Grabowski on Monday be demanded
                        payment for twenty-three days, and upon being refused unless he finished his
                        month or provided a substitute, committed the assault. In the afternoon, he
                        seems to have gone to Mr. Mortimer, the Spanish Consul in Cairo, to whom he
                        said that, having failed to get his money from his former employer, he was
                        compelled to go immediately to Port Said in order to obtain a situation. He
                        was upplied with a ticket and left. presumably for Port Said. Later on the
                        Spanish Consul res ceived a communication on the matter from the Austrian
                        Consul, Dr. Grabowski being an Austrian subject, and steps have been taken
                        by the Spanish Consul to arrest the man.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Grabowski, after the assault, received a letter, dated at Cairo, in which
                        Sanoho said that he was sorry he had done so little injury to him, but that
                        if he were sent to prison, he hoped to come out again one day and to do the
                        same thing again, or even more, unless his money were sent to the Spanish
                        Consul.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Grabowski, who is well known in South Africs and in other parts of the
                        world, is a. gentleman well on in years, and is blind of the right eye,
                        which he lost in the Transvaal War in helping the British army. The blow was
                        delivered him by his assailant on the right side of his face,, and caused an
                        ugly wound. The injury was medically attended to, and we are pleased to
                        understand that Dr. Grabowski is getting on better than expected after such
                        a serious attack.</p>

                    <p>That the French charity ball would be a great success was certain, but even
                        the most optimistio must have declared on Tuesday night that his
                        expectations fell short of the truth. The committee had wrought wonders, the

                        teeth with confetti and serpentines and obviously determined to enjoy
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>At 9.30 p.m. the theatre was ready for the invasion, lit up and decorated,
                        and at 10 p.m., the crowd poured in, overwhelmed the cloakroom, and bore
                        down the resistance of the attendan's. Dominoes and costames followed one
                        another in quick succession, the boxes began to fill, and at 11 p.m. the
                        "Marseillaise" announced the arrival of M. de la Boulinière, who was
                        accompanied by Mme de la Boulinière and her daughters. In the same loge were
                        M. and Mme Barois, M. de Valdrôme, M. du Chaffault, and other members of the
                        personnel of the French Agency and Consulate. The Princes of Orleans passed
                        the greater part of the evening in the French Minister's box and to jadge
                        from the confetti showers that issued therefrom enjoyed themselves
                        hugely.</p>
                    <p>By midnight the theatre was packed-one breathed confetti and straggled with

                        Gallicism may pass-deciding on prize-winners, hurling confetti, managing the
                        tombola, and leading on the crowd of masks and dominoes. When the time for
                        the prize-giving came the judges must have trembled every type of costume,
                        male and, female, was represented, but the charming Roumanian peasant girl

                        only be said that the net profits reached the sum of 45,000 francs. The

                    <head>OFFICIAL TRAINING</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF TE EGYPTIAN GARETTE Sir, The refusal of Chitty Bey to accept
                        the Governorship of the National Bank of Egypt on the ground that he had had
                        no experience of banking busires,has led your correspondent "Common Sense"
                        to hasard the theory that officials in Egypt require a special training
                        before being called upon to fill important posltions. The writer of the
                        letter on this subject, which appeared in your columns on Wednesday, quotes
                        a statement of Sir Oliver Lodge in support of the position he takes up, to
                        the effect that the art of government should not continne to be the one
                        department of human activity for which no special training was sup posed to
                        be necessary. This standpoint is utterly ridiculous in my opinion, and
                        especially so in Egypt, where the principle that a special training is
                        unnecessary for official positions har, as every one knows, produced the
                        most satisfactory results. There is not a Cabinet in Burope, where officers
                        of State have not taken many and varied positions and filled them with
                        conspicuous success. Even so in Egypt the Anglo-Egyptian official has been
                        transferred from one department to another with, I think I may say, very
                        satisfactory results, and it would not be difficult to adduce instances in
                        the present Egyptian Administration where very beneficial consequences have
                        ensued. Caption oritics, who venture to assert that posts are given by
                        favouritism to untrained men, mus confess that the administrative machine
                        rane with remarkable smoothness and that there is really little to complain
                        of. We are much afraid that the arguments advanced by your correspondent
                        "Common Sense" savour o Little Englandism and that be speciously brings
                        forward his plausib'e theory as to the necessity of some training for
                        officials in Egyp not for the benefit of his fellow men but solely as an
                        opportunity for venting his disconten with a system of government that,
                        however im perfeót, has successfully surmounted, appar ently insuperable
                        difficulties and brongh Bgypt to an extraordinary pitch of prosperity.-

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the mostdelightful
                        places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular
                        traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is
                        to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The approach
                        to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port. The town
                        seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
                        stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the

                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>

                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbath and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige
