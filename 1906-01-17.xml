                    <head>PRE-EMPTION</head>
                    <p>One of the greatest legal abuses at present exiting in Egypt is the way in
                        which the law of preemption is employed. Owing to the recent rise in the
                        veins of real property, and the enormous number of sales of land that are
                        now going on all over the country, a condition of affairs has arisen which
                        was never contemplated by those jurisconsults who gave the ancient Oriental
                        privilege of pre-emption in the Code of the Mixed Tribunals. The right of
                        pre-emption is now invoked on every possible occasion, and the result is
                        that the law is made use of to protect the flimsiest sort of claims, to the
                        detriment of the serious capitalist. A recent preemption case affords a good
                        example of how this ancient right is resuscitated to serve a totally
                        different object to that for which it wat originally intended to serve. In e
                        few days' time the test case as to the limits of this law will come before
                        the Mixed Court of Appeal. The Nungovich Hotels Company lately purchased the
                        Mena House Hotel, and after the purchase was completed a native doctor
                        exercises his right of preemption, which it upheld by the Mixed Court of lst
                        Instance. There is no doubt that the judgement was technically correct
                        inasmuch as it was based on a strict interpretation of the law. But it is
                        obvious that this interpretation of the law cannot be considered as in any
                        sense equitable, and it will be interesting to see whether the Appeal Court
                        will give a more liberal interpretation than did the lower Court. But
                        whether the Court upholds or quashes this particular decision it is
                        necessary that the law of preemption must be radically changed, for its
                        continual abuse has become a national nuisance.</p>

                    <head>MOSQUITOES AND MALARIA.</head>
                    <p>A Calcutta paper has recently been discovering the best means of getting rid
                        of that "humming bird," the mosquito. That the method advised of fumigating
                        a room causing the insects to become partially stupified, and so to fall
                        easy victims of the tanglefoot fly-paper ready placed for their delectation
                        and death at a lighted window, the remainder of the room being in darkness,
                        is no doubt as efficacious as it is ancient; but, after all, "prevention is
                        better than cure" as the old proverb has it; and not to have mosquitoes in
                        the homes at all is far better than to allow them entrance and then to take
                        steps for their extermination.</p>
                    <p>In the malarial districts of Africa, both East and West, and also in the
                        United States and elsewhere on the American Continent, in the summer months
                        a plan very widely adopted in modern dwellings is that of the "mosquito
                        proof' house. So effective has this proved to be in the prevention of
                        malaria that some of the railways have adopted it not only for the cabooses
                        used by their employees travelling almost continually in the low veldt and
                        on the flats where mangrove swamps abound, but also, in some cases, for
                        their general passenger rolling-stock. Every window of the dwelling is
                        provided on the outside with a well-fitting frame, opening up a French
                        window, covered with wire gauze of a fine mesh, which, whilst admitting
                        light and air, effectively prevents small flying insect pests of every
                        description from entering. Doors are fitted in much the same manner,
                        swinging frames, hinged inside the main door, being need to support the wire
                        gauze. In South Africa, where the climatic conditions are so different, it
                        is usual, especially among the extreme faddists, to keep these wire doors
                        closed throughout the day ; hot doubtless they would serve the purpose for
                        which they intended were they to remain closed between the hours of sunset
                        and sunrise only. Such a scheme has not been considered necessary in
                        Colombo, bat bungalows on estates in low-lying malarial district might be
                        thus fitted to advantage, and the following instance, if indeed one is
                        wanted, will prove the necessity of providing against malarial fever through
                        inoculation by mosquitoes. About two years ago, at a certain hospital in
                        Rhodesia, where quite 90 percent of the European patients are admitted
                        suffering from malarial fever, it wai ootioed by the dxitor tbat,after
                        having soooei*- folly treated his oases, and the temperature) of hi*
                        patients were once more down to normal or thereabouts, on the fourth or
                        fifth day after admission, at first inexplicably, a large proportion of
                        those under hie oare bad relapses, and up went their temperatures almost as
                        high as ever ; with the result that the treatment had to be started
                        praetioally all over again. It was the dootor'* idea that, with fresh oases
                        of malaria coming in daily, the mosquitoes promptly oarried infeotion from
                        the new patients to those convalescent Accordingly, step* were taken .to
                        prevent this ; and the oor- reotnees of this theory was at once proved, for
                        almost immediately t he average etay -'n hoepital of patients suffering from
                        malarial fever dropped from ten or twelve days to I Positive results each a*
                        these—to say nothing of the exhaustive experi ments conducted in the
                        malarial swamps of Southern Italy foor year* ago—go far to prove the
                        absolute neoemity of preventing innocola- tion by mosquitoes. 8noh ordinary

                    <p>IMPORTS INCREASE BY ONE MILLION</p>
                    <p>The Castoms returns for December last, which have just been issned, are of
                        exceptional importance inasmuch as they famish us with the statistics not

                        Administration, which "'ll ^0t appear for a month or tijo yet. The imports
                        for December fell considerably below the figures for the same month of 1904,
                        bat as was pointed oat in the November Journal of the British Chamber of
                        Commerce, this must ntft be taken to indicate that trade is in any way
                        retrogressing. It is to ba borne in mind that the clearances dnring the
                        November and December of 1901 were phenomenally large. Aboat that time
                        merchants and retailers, through commission agents, apparently all though*;
                        it necessary to lay in heavy atooks. These stooks ryare not so readily
                        assimilated as had been anticipated, and therefore in many trader buyers had
                        to oartail their purchases last year. This is made evident by the faot that
                        although the total increase in the import trade in 1904 amoanted tQ aloae on
                        four millions (whioh, it mast be admitted, was altogether phenomenal), the
                        inore ise reoorded in 1905 only figured oat at something over one million
                        (Egyptian pounds). Notwithstanding, the year's import returns constitnte a
                        record, and even if the same rate of progress was not maintained as in 1904,
                        the figares mast bj considered satisfactory as showing not only that there
                        has been no aotoal retrogression but that the normal rate of progress has
                        been maintained. A comparison of the figares for the past three years, with
                        the respective shares of the principal importing countries, will prove
                        interesting.</p>

                        cafe in Sharia El Zsher, Cairo, when three persons, two Englishmen belonging

                        requested him to give them money. The Prinos told them that he had no money
                        on him, bat they would accept no ex onge and threatened him with death if he
                        would not comply with their demands. Seeing how persistently these men
                        demanded money, Prince Ahmed wrote oat a little note and, calling his
                        servant, be said quietly: Well, my friends, this hote will ensure your

                        appeared upon the soene, and the Prince was released from his predicament,
                        while the Italian was taken to prison. The latter has confessed his guilt

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt fur too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to
                        Plymouth, Southampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short
                        ones ore us follows;— Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi 3 days Alexandria
                        to Messina 3 „ Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles 5 „ Alexandria to
                        Venice and Trieste... 4 „ Alexandria to Naples 3 „ Port Said to Genoa 5 „
                        Port Said to Naples 4 „ Alexandria to Constantinople ... 4 „ Alexandria to
                        l'ineus 2 „ Port Said to Gibraltar 7 „</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and 0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are

                    <p>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable
                        ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of
                        speed. They are called the "Perry boats," having been specially built to
                        carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight
                        through to England you will find the train waiting at .Brindisi which will
                        take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for j
                        sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth
                        day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is thc
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Beale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovanni degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Llovd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        1 during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 8 days. NAPLES is also
                        reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers,
                        which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to
                        explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri. From Naples to ROME is a
                        train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week
                        to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal
                        City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment hero.
                        Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers arid its surrounding country. In Florence itself the !
                        churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        Colli, one of the finest walks m Europe, opened 85 years ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                        outside Florence is that te Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above
                        the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St.
                        Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of
                        oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view. PISA
                        is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ;here there is a fine
                        Cathedral jand the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should If
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                        Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                        half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable ;
                        and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most I picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                        with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                        cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously
                        cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travelers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail. MILAN is a good
                        centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the. Lakes. The
                        Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit. Between Bologna and Milan and only an j
                        hour and-a- half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea-port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.
                        COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter

                        Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
