                    <p> "Christmas comes but once a year, </p>
                    <p>And when it comes it brings good cheer." So runs the old coupletand as far as
                        the first line is concerned it is almost universally correct. But it fails
                        to take into account such an exceptional state of things as that to be found
                        in this country. Here we have a large Greek element, and while the Anglican
                        Protestant Church and the Latin Churches generally celebrate the birth of
                        Christ on December 25th, the Greek and Eastern Churches defer their
                        celebration till the 7th of January-the period of the Epipbany. Consequently
                        we get in Egypt two Christmas Days in the year each observed by a large
                        number of commercial men ; indeed, so large is the Greek community here that
                        practically business is suspended in most houses on the later as well as the
                        earlier date. What a boon would this be considered in the busy City of
                        London--at least by the employés, for such a state of things would hardly
                        commend itself to the heads of firms, so greatly would it interfere with
                        business of all kinds in that world's centre. </p>
                    <p>It is interesting to study the early recorde of the observance of Christmas

                        birth of Jesus Christ. Indeed, many early writers holds that it was a
                        special providence that appointed the birth of Christ to take place in the
                        midst of pagan festivals. Menander gives a long account of these, and
                        considers that a festival held on the shortest day-the winter solstice
                        presented the opportunity of a transition to the Christian point of view ;
                        Christ, the sun of the spiritual world, being compared with the sun of the
                        material world. The comparison was carried still further, for as in the
                        material world it is after dark. ness has reached its highest point that the
                        end of its dominion is already near, and the light begins to acquire fresh
                        power, so, too, in the spiritual world Christ, the spiritual sun, must
                        appear to make an end of the kingdom of darkness. But the date to be
                        observed presented a difficulty, and while the Western Churches decided on
                        the 25th December, the Eastern Churches deferred it till the Epiphany. Hence
                        the difference of dates at the present time. </p>
                    <p>Christmas is a time when absent friends claim a goodly share of our thoughts.
                        Coupled with these, no doubt, in the minds of many Englishmen resident in
                        Egypt, is the regret that they cannot be in the old country "to put their
                        legs under the parental mahogany," and enjoy the roast beef of Old England,
                        or the plump Norfolk turkey. These are things that are perhaps not
                        obtainable in this country But we would say to our young friends, "Cheer up!
                        Cold storage has been introduced and if you cannot feast on a good sirloin
                        of Scotch -beef, you may get that excellent substitute, a joint of the rich
                        meat that comes from all parts, Vorth, Central, and South, of the American
                        continent and which loses so little of its flavour in the freezing process,
                        that it is often enjoy. ed as much as, and even preferred before, - when the
                        source from which it comes is not known, the home fed beef And the children
                        (blessthem !), what of them at Christmas tine! A glance at the shop windows
                        fully assures us that they are not forgotten. It is worth while to pay a
                        visit to the bazaars and large drapery establishments if only to note the
                        plethora of dolls, mechanical toys, and novelties of all descriptions that
                        are offered to the purchaser vf presents for the little ones. The Christmas
                        tree, too, is quite an institution in Egypt. So we wish to "one and all,
                        both great and small," ävery Merry Christmas and a Happy New </p>
                    <p>Year. Now-a-days it is the custom to alter the wish to that for a Happy
                        Christmas, and tak. ing into consideration the very many cases where the
                        season from various causes cannot be a merry one, the old wish often seems a
                        mockery. We can wish everybody happiness from the bottom of our hearts. </p>
                    <p>The "good cheer" of Christmas is too well established a thing for the old
                        customs ever to be broken. The fashions may change and the Yule Log
                        disappear, but never will Christ mastide cease to be associated with family
                        reunions and general feasting. Of late years a growing tendency has
                        manifested itself to make the festival &amp; time for a more general
                        loosening of the purse-strings than formerly. That Christmas-time is the
                        only period of the year that many open their hearts and their purses for the
                        benefit of the poor is a sail reflection, and reminds us of so many people
                        who only put on religion with their Sunday </p>
                    <p>lothes and feel when they take them off that there is no necessity to think
                        about spiritual natters for another six days. None the less lo we rejoice to
                        see the movement extend rear after year, and if the progress is slow we rust
                        that it will be sure. In the large cities of Cairo and Alexandria we have
                        many destiute wanderers, who will be glad to receive ome of the good things
                        of the season, and lo doubt the Rudolpb and other Homes will eceive an
                        increase of support that will enable hem to give the poor who apply to them

                        <p>The sén doe given on Sunday night at the Khedivial Hotel by M. Door
                            Leblado and his mediom before a small but very select audience was a
                            most interesting demonstra tion of conjuring tricks and thought-reading.
                            The performance was divided into tbree parts. The first consisted in a
                            series of clever conjaring feate, followed by an exposition of the
                            trioks employed to do them. The second part was devoted to
                            tbongbt-reading, and here the modiom, blindfolded and in a trance,
                            witboat any direct contact with the hypnoticor, carried out many clover
                            and complicated aots at the request of some of the spectators. In the
                            third part the medium, whilst in the trance, transported herself
                            anywhere and gave vivid and exciting desoriptions o' what distant
                            relatives or friends were doing at that mo mont in Rossia, America, the
                            Sadan, etc. The evening broke op with some clever thooght reading by the
                            "magio band" table, whicb by repeated taps on the glass on which it was
                            laid answered all sorts of questions. At the end of the performance it
                            was annoupoed that person wishing to consult privately tbe mediom with
                            regard to distant relatives or on other points could do so in the

                    <p>An important meeting of the shareholders of Walker and Meimaracbi Limited was
                        beld on Saturday afternoon at the Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo, and 80,000
                        shares were represented. The chair was taken by Maitre Carton de Wiart,
                        chairman of the looal board, and the otber members of that board present
                        were George Nongovich Bey, Mr. Constantine Meimarachi and Mr. Landaner. </p>
                    <p>Moltre Carton de Wiart said that that assembly was not a general meeting,
                        that it was an act, pot provided for in the statates, but that it was
                        nevertheless a Deoessary aot, although, be added, "there are no pessimistio
                        considerations to preoconpy 08, as the company's affaire are most
                        satisfactory. A coording to the statutes the company is Englisb, under
                        British law, and managed in London. Therefore all meetings must be held in
                        London. The chairman went on to say that the company last year was in need
                        of foods. The emission was almost entirely covered in Egypt by the members
                        of the board and their friende. Since then the administration had set to
                        work ; tbey bad done their best, for already thore was £35,000 worth of
                        business more than at the same period last year; besides they had arquired a
                        valuable property ; tbey bought &amp; plot for £75,000, of which oply balt
                        was atilized for building the shops on, the other half baviog been sold for
                        £56,000, thus reducing the price of the remaioing plot to £18,000. "How is
                        it, however, that tbe sbares are below pall' be said. The reason is that the
                        two board, the one in London and the one in Cairo, differed in opinion in
                        regard to this enterprise. It was not suffi sient to wish that the board
                        were transferred to Cairo, but it would be necessary to change the statates.
                        Tbe sharebolders have a right to eff sot this change ; they can ask at the
                        general meeting to bave the board transerred to Cairo. Bat for the present
                        this is but a vain wish. </p>
                    <p>"As far I am concerned," continued Maitre Carton de Wiart, "I hall most
                        decidedly not submit to a board in London." An ordinary geDeral meeting will
                        be held in London in order to examine the accounts, and an extraordinary
                        general meeting to decide whether the abovestated modification will be made
                        or not: it I would be necessary that all shareholders be </p>
                    <p>represented at this meeting. The chairman, in or noludiog, made very
                        reasoring statements in regard to the company's business. </p>
                    <p>M. Paul Oziol declared that the board abould certainly be in Cairo, and
                        blamed the board in London for having delayed six months before commenoing
                        the works; be asked whether it would not be possible to prosecute |tbe
                        English board for their mismanagement of affairs. </p>
                    <p>M. Conika expressed the same views on the subject. </p>
                    <p>Maitre Carton de Wiart pointed out that of | 293,000 shares only 80,000 were
                        represented. It was evident that the greater part of the capital was in
                        England, but there were more tban 80,000 sbares in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Energetio measures must be taken and a delegate sent to London. </p>
                    <p>The meeting unapimoasly expressed them selves desirous to see the board

                        time. This stall was most ably presided over by Mrs. Morrison and the Misses
                        Davis, assisted by Miss Claxton, Rov. Grabam (H.M.S. Venus), and Mr. E.

                        confa. sion or disorder. A bookstall, beld by the Misses Atkin, was very
                        profitable. The articles on this stall, though dainty and useful, were
                        inexpensive, and there must bave been many parcbarers to enable these ladies
                        to band in the sum of over £6 (including sale of tickets). </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Kingbam's flower stall was most artistically arranged, and transformed
                        that portion of the ball into a garden of beauty. The exquisite
                        "battonholes" (provided at Mrs. Kingbam's expense) sold off rapidly. This
                        lady and her daughter are much to be congratulated upon the great 8000888

                        sale of tickets) was realized. At this stall Master Bssil Rees proved
                        himself to be a most snocessful salesman. </p>

                        ovident, for within the space of one and a half hours, two bandred people
                        were served with an excellent tea. Mrs. Sidney Carver kindly undertook the

                    <p>( FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. ) </p>
                    <p>Laxor, December 19. Visitors to Egypt are at length realizing that tbe trip
                        op-river is far bet er ondertaken as soon as tbe cold weather first makes
                        its appearance in Cairo. Not only do they thos get back to the genial warmth
                        and sunshine, but they also are then able to return to the Capital when tbe
                        bigh season is in full swing. if indeed the attractions of society are
                        greater than those of antiquarian research surrounded by ideal conditions. i
                        Already a great many visitors are in the neighbourhood; some engaged in
                        business which is everywhere inoreasing, but mostly bent on pleasure and
                        spending a pionio existence among the endless objects of interest botb in
                        Luxor and close roand. Dababeabs, both large and small, are constantly
                        arriving and leaving : for doubtless where time is unlimited this way of
                        seeing the country has medyadvantages, and the restful life aboard in machto
                        be desired. Coles Pasbo, Mrs. Coles, and their two daaghters have been
                        ashore several times these last few daye, and Birch Pasba's steam laudoh has
                        been at anchor to day while he and his bride have been exploring somewhat.
                        Sir W. Ewart and his family are staying at the Luxor Hotel for the time
                        being, and Col. and Mrs. Armstrong, Mr. and Mrs. Tite, the Rev. Sams and the
                        Rev. Mr. Fetberstone are also staying at the same popular hotel, where the
                        garden is one of its obiet attractions, with its tennis and croquet courts,
                        its shady palms and trees, and its wealth of roses, mimosa, and other
                        sweetly. smelling flowers. | The Countess Hedda de Brockdorff was also a
                        visitor at the Laxor for a faw daye. She has now lett by the Mayflower for
                        Assouan, where she will spend most of the winter on account of her bealth.
                        She passes nearly overy winter abroad and knows a good part of India and the
                        East, but this is her first stay in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>M. Naville is expected to arrive before long. His presence is anxiously
                        awaited for at Deir el Babari as farther discoveries at that famous site are
                        sur le tapis, and nothing can be done without him. Many artists are en
                        camping in that neigbbourhood, the weather being fine enough to allow them
                        to sleep in the open every night it fanoy takes them that way. </p>
                    <p>There are many advantages accraing from the position occupied by the Savoy
                        Hotel, which lies at the fortber end of the village to that occupied by the
                        Loxor Hotel and right on the river bank. It is an imposing and
                        comfortable-looking building approached by an avende of palms and mimosa ;
                        and owns a wide and shady verandab well fornished with easy chairs, and the
                        largest bull loange at present in Luxor. Tea is often served, too, in the
                        two kiosks at the river gate from whence steps lead to the sailing boats
                        which ply op and down and across the river. This hotel has many
                        old-established patrons, and many of the artists at Deirel Babari and ober
                        places in the neighbourhood make it their headquarters. Among these may be
                        mentioned Mr. Henry Simprop, Mr. Walter Tyndale, Migs McCracken, Miss
                        Haddon, and Miss Parmioter. The Rev. Dr. Colin Campbell and Mrs. Campbell
                        are spending the entire season at the Savoy. Dr. Colin Campbell is one of
                        the best-known of our prosent-day Egyptologists, and his refatation most
                        ofttimos be irksome to bim : for people seek his authority at every tarn,
                        and will not allow bim to pursue his investigations in private. </p>

                    <p>The farewell piece was Bernstein's "Rafale," which is the drama of a gambler.
                        Chagoeroy the lover of Hélène de Bréchebel, and representative of a racing
                        stable finadoed by men whose names do not appear, loses at baccarat some
                        £26,000 which be should band over to these people as the results of a sale
                        of racehorses. All efforts to raise the sum in time fail, and be ends the
                        problem by suicide. Of course the ipoidental 1880ee, Hélène's love and
                        persistence which forces his confession, ber struggle with her rich tatber
                        seeking advancement among the pobility, but yet only too business-like-for
                        be forces ber confegeion in ber torn-bis interview with the contemptuous,
                        younger son,- all these aro and make the play,-a very great play too. Apd it
                        is the drama of those two. Both Mlle Brandès and M. Rousselle were at their
                        height ; her frantio efforts with any and every One who might save her
                        lover, the great scene with ber fatber, these showed how Martbe Brando's can
                        move and bold as. And be also held 08-bis confession wherein be makes light
                        of all at the end, taking pleasure oven in losing, his soene with ber
                        father, cynical, Opapproachable, incomprehensible to the poor, sbrowd
                        parvenu – and, greatest of all that M. Rousselle has done in these siz
                        nights, his silence, resolved, lingering ratber than besitat ing over bis
                        farewell to all things--all little tiny familiar details of the room that
                        witnessed love, elation, loer, and at last decision as of one content with
                        himself--these scenes were beyond praise. For both of them, we could not ask
                        for words, we would bat wait and watch their eyer, their lips about to open
                        perbaps, then close : no word might be spokon, but the silence said all. The
                        scene lived in itself before us, in its own light, created by these two. </p>
                    <p>The rest were surprisingly good. M. Gournao and Mme. Laure, the two Lebourgs,
                        wero faaltloss, M. Alerme was, as ever, dry, cypical, almost malicious,
                        entirely 80 when Hélène know and repulsed that only evil condition on which
                        be might and would help ber, rancorous in his so-called socialism – but ever
                        quiet, driving every point home by the least mark in tone or glance. Those
                        others wbo bad far less to do, did well, well enough to be notice, though
                        these five "principals" overshadowed all else. The play from first to last
                        was shown in its fall perfection. And so we have seen the last – for the
                        time being — of Mlle Brandès apd M. Rousselle. I do not hesitate to mention
                        the two together. Thoagb be bas pot, as I said before, the personality whiob
                        remains through every part he plays, tbough be is the personage each time,
                        and not one in many young and phases, yet his achievements are, I think, po
                        less than bers or those of anyone in relation to the dramas be interprets. </p>
                    <p>We have had six wonderful nights, and seen six wonderful plays : and, I hear,
                        we may, during next year, hope for more good thirga. Forandy comes in April.
                        Guitry and Antoine may come. Look to it, playgoers of Cairo, that these and
                        the great plays they will interpret meet the welcome they merit. I am only
                        too glad to say, that though the house was not always filled, the audience
                        showed kooner and keeper appreciation, night by night ; last night every one
                        seemed to hang on every word and every glance of the actors : all the
                        Doises, so often a curse to listeners, were sterr. ly and sharply repressed,
                        and the few offenders, less ripping than sinned against by dranghts, cbairs
                        to be moved and other worries, respond ed by subsiding at opoe, and
                        rivalling their jadges in keen attention. May it always be go! And why not,
                        when the life itself, perhaps of those we know, it may even come to pass, of
                        ourselves, is shown so vivid and keen before our eyes, by those who can
                        reveal and beigb ten its last least pbases and details ? </p>

                    <p>The opera season opened on Saturday night with "LA Bobème," the well known
                        and ever. popular work of Paccipi. The theatre was packed and presented a
                        most brilliant appear. ance. The interpretation on the whole may be termed
                        good. "Rodolfo" the tenor (Signor Acerbi) is endowed with a fine and very
                        pleasing voice particularly suited to the music he had to sing. His singing
                        called for two "epoores." "Mimi" (Signor Belendi Livia) is not a new comer
                        on the Zizipia stage ; ber magnificent interpretation of Carmen some years
                        back is still fresh in the memory of the Zizinis "abon és." Her rendering of
                        the role of "Mimi" was met with much applause. She combines good singing
                        with excellent acting. She was particularly good in the death soone of the
                        last act. Sigpora Prizi did well in the ongrateful role of "Musetta." The
                        baryton (Dalbope) and the base Baldasseri were also good, the latter was
                        encored in his solo. The orobestra under, tbe able direction of the Maestro
                        Zoocani, now quite an old friend, - as it is the third year that he has
                        directed the orobestra - could not have been better. It is premature to
                        judge the merits of the troppe on a first performance, or ventore on an
                        opinion as to tbe kind of season we are likely to have. Any such oriticism
                        must be left for a later date. </p>

                    <p>REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS</p>
                    <p>Tne directors consider the results attained in the year ended September 30 as
                        evidenoirg the high intrinsic and economic value of the rights possessed by
                        the corporation. '1 he operations reviewed have not been of an ex
                        peditionary nature Tbe definite ascertain­ment of the permanency and
                        excellency of tbe water supply dispelled any doubts that may have existed
                        respecting it, and clearly revealed the land as the constitutive factor in
                        deter mining the prosperity of the enterprise. Land development has
                        consequently received primary consideration. The subsidiary works are im
                        cortant, and in tbe opinion ot the directors are capable of contributing in
                        no small degree to tbe corporation's earning capacity, but relatively to the
                        land they are quite subei diary. A preliminary number of bores have been pat
                        down, and land for experimental purposes, on which cotton and numerous other
                        crops have been most successfully grown, has been cultivated around each of
                        the finished wells. Pending the completion of the 'ail way, which at the
                        oLwe of tbe year under review wm completely laid to kilometre 67, the number
                        of drilling machines has been strictly limited owing to tbe excessive cost
                        of camel transport Mineral research has been actively prosecuted, and a
                        large amount of analytical and exploratory work hu been carried out, while
                        actual divelopment of proved beds of earthy minerals has bien accomplished.
                        The directors record that tbe Egyptian Government have missed no opp^r
                        tunity of extending their assistance to tbe cor poration in matters
                        pertaining to the develop ment of the ones ; and they are confi lent th it
                        tbe attitude of the G jvernmeut will continue to be of the most friendly
                        character. Recent expren non has been given to the deteriuinati n of tbe
                        Government to assist the corporation in its operations in every reasonable
                        way. In order to complete the railway to Khugih as early as possible in the
                        coming year and to oops w th the work of land reclamation on a large scale,
                        arrangements are being male for the early issue of the balance of capital.
                        Meantime the final call of 5s. per share, making all shares fully paid, has
                        been made, so as to enable vigorous construction to proceed an
                        interruptedly. Pending completion of the railway, it has not been deemed
                        advisable to deal with the oases prodnoa on any exten lei scale, but

                        tbe Very Rev. Dean Butcher. It has occurred to me that it would, perhaps, be
                        interesting to your Lordship and those with wh^m yon are acting, to know the
                        opinion of the parishioners of Hammersmith on tbe departure of Mr Butcher 42
                        years ago after having served as Curate of the Parish Church for fi e

                        Shanghai. During ths fivey aro be had worked in Hammersmith he had endeared
                        himself to the parishioners</p>
                    <p>Happily there are a few of tbe present congregation, of whom tba writer is
                        one, who remember his sterling worth as a minister and preacher, and who
                        still regard him with affectionate remembrance.</p>
                    <p>It was confi iently anticipated that Mr. Bu' ober would make his mark in th]
                        Church, and his services were so highly appreciated that in 1876 he was
                        raised to the dignity of Dean of tbe Ca'b>dral of the 11 >'y T iiity,
                        Slnugha .</p>

                        was announ­ced that the testimonial would take the form of a purse of gold.

                    <p>It may be of interest to recall a similar pre­sentation as the one proposed

                        ago.</p>

                        year anticipated removal. It was felt instinctively that your earnest

                        welfare of our deutely populat­ed pariah during five years' residence
                        amongtt us should not pass away without special re­cognition and record.
                        These sentiments, atreog- thenel in many by feeling] of da'p personal regard
                        and aff lotion have found their natural expression (at th's juncture) in the
                        eager anxiety of all classci without exception to participate in a parting
                        evidence of goodwill and Christian sympathy. It has been judged best to
                        leave our united freewill offering (to which the poorest have heartily
                        contributed acoordiag to theiv ability) entirely at your dis- pAsal rather
                        than convey it in a form (however . gratifying) which might prove cumbersome

                        <p>Dear Sir,—1 am an occasional visitor to Helouan, and last Sunday I was
                            sargsised to find that pigeon shootmg was being oasriod on daring the
                            afternoon, very oloau to ous of the principal hotels, so alone, in feet,
                            that one lady visitor informed me that a few days before, after n pigeon
                            shooting match, five wounded birds had fluttered into het room through
                            the open window. 1 will not experea my views as to the cruelty of this
                            so sailed "sport " of pigeon shooting. Most English people, I believe,
                            have decided opinions on the sob jeot. I would merely suggest that if
                            the hotdh in Helouan wish to lose their Britiab patienag", there is no
                            easier way for them to tong this about than by allowing thio form- of
                            sport to be carried on at little more than 100 yards distance from their
                            visitors' bed rooms—I sm, etc.,</p>
