                            <p>A remarkable feature of the situation in Russia is the constant
                                spread of the strike movement in all directions.

                                are generally quieter, though there are occasional disturbances.
                                Work is still suspended. The agitation is increasing at Tiflis and
                                Batum. In the former town, there have been sanguinary conflicts in
                                the streets between the police and cossacks and the revolutionary
                                mobs. The strike is spreading on the Trans-caucasion railway. A
                                troop train proceeding to Batum was derailed, the line being cut.

                        FISHERIES</head>
                    <p>The nile cold storage company is experimenting in a new direction. A steam
                        trawler hired by the company for six months, with option of purchase at the
                        expiry of the period should the results obtained justify the course, has
                        commenced operations off port said, and has met with decided success in her
                        first two ventures. Good takes of merlan, soles, skate, loup-de-mer, and
                        John dory are reported with a fair number of red mullet of better quality
                        and far larger size than those usually seen in Egyptian restaurants and
                        hotels. The latter, taken as a rule within a few miles of the coast, are
                        almost all immature fish weighing as a rule from 1.5 to 2 ounes, but the
                        trawler has already taken a few half pounders, with a large proportion of
                        six ounce fish. It is of, course, too early yet to anticipate large takes of
                        excellent soles and transcendant red mullet finding their way to cairo and
                        alexandria, to the delight of dinners out. Nothing, or next to nothing is
                        known of the feeding grounds and general habits and distribution of the
                        numerous specis of fish that occur in Egyptian waters, except within a belt
                        not exceeding a dozen miles in distance from the coast. The fisherman of our
                        coast line from alexandria to port said rarely venture further, but a steam
                        trawler can work in the waters for thirty miles without any risk of finding
                        her return impeded by adverse winds. Among the recent catches of the
                        companys trawler- which by the way is an up to date boat manned by a british
                        crew and commanded by capt Micholson on fleetwood, who is known as the
                        pioneer of steam trawling in englandare a number of large trukish sponges of
                        large size and fine quality. A sponge fishery has been for some time
                        established at marsa Matrouh, but the frequent roughness of the sea outside
                        the small and obstructed harbour has frequently proved a great hindrance to
                        diving. The discovery of sponges of a good quality within 30 miles of port
                        said is valuable in itself, and there is every reason to suppose that the
                        development of the egyptian fisheries will be of great economic importance
                        to the country. The coast fishermen, with inadequate appliances frequently
                        succeed in making good takes of fish, and the steam trawler and her two
                        sisters shortly arriving should be far more fortunate. </p>

                    <head>CORPORATION OF WESTERN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The directors of the corporation of western egypt, limited, who have been
                        staying at the savoy hotel for the last fortnight, have now left cairo for
                        england via naples. The party included Messrs. the Hou. Alexander O. Murray,
                        master of eubank, J.P., D.L., M.P., chairman of the corporation, Charles
                        E.H. Hobhouse, J.P., M.P., the Hon. W. Twilough O'brien, William Heaton
                        Armstrong, and W. Chas Scales. The object of their visit was to discuss the
                        companys policy wit the local board and railway and mining engineers, and to
                        thoroughly investigate the companys interests on the spot. We understand
                        that Mr. Waller, of the well known firm of Messrs. Kincard, waller, maville,
                        and dawson, the corporations consulting engineers, has now completed his
                        report on the section of the railway which the corporation are building to
                        connect the Oasis of Kharga with the egyptian governmetn ranway at farshut,
                        a distance of 118 miles. It was feared taht the first ten miles of this
                        section would be very expensive, but Mr. Waller now reports that by taking
                        the line among a certain Wadt the plateau can be reached without any extra
                        expense. It is evident that the directors are actively attending to the
                        business in hand, and we understand that they have expressed themselves as
                        being much impressed with the corporations various interests. Taking into
                        consideration the high standing and ability of the directorate, the
                        importance of many of the names on the list of shareholders, and the
                        enormous porenrialites of the corporations concessions, which will be opened
                        up by the new railway, it is evident that the corporation has before it a
                        brilliant future. Application has been made to the london stock exchange
                        committee to appoint a special setting day in corporation of western egypt,
                        seven shares of $1 each, fully paid, Nos 250,001 to 250,007 and 250,000
                        shares of $1 each, 10s. paid, Nos. 1 to 250,000.</p>

                    <p><persName>Messrs. Hoare and Russell</persName>, having been charged to audit
                        the accounts of the Egyptian post office administration, have drawn up on
                        the subject an exhaustive report which has jsut been handed in to the
                        ministry of finance. The auditors report that they have found, as the result
                        of their elaborate investigation, that the detailed work of the accounts
                        department at the head office is genearlly satisfactory but that, good as
                        the sytem is up to a certain point, it lacks completeion and therfore cannot
                        be so effective as it otherwise would be. Many of the branch offices were
                        visited, and the auditors declare themselves satisfied with the results of
                        their inspections. The system of returns, so far as they record current
                        transactions, is well adapted to the requirements of the head office. They
                        consider that the completion of the system on the lines laid down in the
                        detailed report is much required and recommend that steps should be taken to
                        carry this into effect.</p>

                        and building fund, was held on tuesday in the temporary church room in the

                        proceedings, it was decided to proceed forth with the building of a church
                        sufficiently large to accommodate for the present 300 persons and so adapted
                        that it can be enlarged at any future time without interfering with the

                        companys fleet, the P.W.S. Cairo, has just been launched from the companys
                        dockyard at khartoum north, and left the day before yesterday for the white
                        nile on her maiden trip. His excellency the governor general inspected the
                        boat and make a short run up river. He expressed his satisfaction with the
                        general arragnements provided in the boat, and called her a most magnificent
                        steamer. She has a length of 120 feet, 22 foot beam and 2ft 6 draught, 300
                        indicated H.P., speed 12 miles an hour. She possesses a handsome and

                        smoke room, four singel state rooms, six double state rooms with appendices
                        and promenade fore and amidships. The cabins, saloon and smoke room are
                        mosquito proof. The owners claim that the style, finish, and general
                        furnishings of this boat are equal to any first class liner, while the
                        cabins are much larger than is usually found in the latter. It is the first

                    <head>EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE RUSSIAN FLEET</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes: The leading ar- ticle in the "Egyptian Gazette" on
                        the position of the Egyptian Government in its policy towards the Russian
                        fleet was admirably oogent in its logic. But viewed in its purely legal
                        aspect, this question should be looked at As one which concerns Egypt alone
                        and without reference to Great Britain. A copy of the Suez Canal Convention
                        lies before me. It was signed at Constantinople on the 29th October, 1888,
                        and ratifications were deposited at Constanti- nople on the 22nd December of
                        that year. The Convention was made between Great Britain, Germany,
                        Austria-Hungary, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Turkey.
                        "Egypt's political status is," as the Judicial Adviser correctly observes,
                        "that of a part of the Ottoman Dominions." She has therefore no individual
                        power to make treaties save such as the firmans of the Sultan of Turkey ex-
                        pressly authorise. Those firmans did not invest her with power to enter into
                        the Suez Canal Convention, which was consequently made on her behalf by her
                        Turkish suzerain. It follows then that if the Convention was binding on
                        Turkey it was binding on Egypt. If it was binding on Egypt in 1888—the date
                        of its signature—it was equally binding upon her in 1898, at the time of the
                        passage of the Spanish Fleet, and in 1904, at the time of the passage of the
                        Russian Fleet through the Canal. The Egyptian Government held—so the
                        Judicial Adviser informs us— that the Convention was not binding upon Egypt
                        in 1898. Assuming that view to be correct, and nothing having been done by
                        Turkey to render the Convention binding in the interval between that date
                        and 1904, it was not binding upon Egypt in 1904.- The fact that the British
                        Government did not consider the Convention binding upon them in 1898 by
                        reason of a reservation made in 1888 with reference to retaining full
                        liberty of action regarding the British Occupation of Egypt, could in no
                        respect affect Egypt's con- tractual obligations in 1898 any more than Great
                        Britain's announcement of her adherence to the Convention as recorded in the
                        Anglo- French Agreement of April, 1904—to which, by the way, Turkey was not
                        a party—can affect Egypt's obligations at the present time. It will be seen
                        that, starting from the same premises as the Judicial Adviser, I arrive at a
                        different conclusion. The difficulty of the Judicial Adviser was from the
                        first obvious, and, I venture to think, insurmountable, namely, the
                        divergence between the technical and the actual position—the status de jur
                        and that de facto—of Egypt He may well be pardoned for having tailed to
                        reconcile the irreconcilable.</p>

                    <p>The Native Bar has recently gained a victory over the Ministry of Justice
                        and, although it is only a trifling matter, the successful issue has given
                        great satisfaction, as the native barristers are by no means content with
                        the persistent efforts of the Ministry to rule over them "par conseil de
                        discipline." Recently a circular was issued to the barristers' clerks
                        requiring them to furnish to the Court of Appeal a certificate of good
                        conduct and a photograph. This arbitrary interference naturally called forth
                        a number of protests, and a meeting of the clerks was held, when it was
                        agreed that they should strike if the circular was put into force. The vote
                        of this meeting was unanimous and the decision was com- municated to Judge
                        Bond, Vice-President of the Native Court of Appeal, by the members of the
                        Bar, who stated that their clerks one and all refused to submit to any such
                        con- ditions whatsoever. The result was that the obnoxious circular was
