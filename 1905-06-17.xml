                        Gonvcrnorat reports that it appears from the investigations made that the
                        thieves ore Amdrous Melnka, Said Hannalla, a money changer, Ibrahim Ashour,
                        a labourer, and Mankarins, a barber. These men divided the money among
                        themselves, bought a house at Haret el Nasarn, 1,500 metres of land at
                        Shoubra, and were negotiating for the purchase of a honse at Eagallab for
                        £3,000, but they did conclude the bargain for fear of attracting attention.
                        Amdrons also bought jewels for his wife. The box which contained the stolen
                        money remained buried for several weeks in an unknown place and it was then
                        brought to Said Hannalla's house and burnt there. The houses of the accused
                        have been searched by the police. £2,723 was found in tin box built in the
                        wall in Amdrous's house and£400 and a quantity of jewels and valuable papers
                        were found in Said Hannals's house. The accused deny the charge of theft,
                        but they are being retained in prison during the enquiry.</p>

                        This steamer has a full cargo of rice from Bangkok, and grounded apparently
                        last Thursday night She was reported here yesterday by the Dutch mail boat,
                        which brought her chief officer to Suez. According to the latter's
                        statement, the vessel is not in a bad position, and it is expected that she
                        will come off after discharging 400/500 tons of cargo, and for this purpose
                        several lighters and labourers are about to sail from Suez this afternoon.
                        The Khedivial mail liner "Rahmanieh'' is also leaving Suez to-night to

                    <p>An important American expedition is to be despatched to Upper Egypt to
                        observe the eclipse of the sun, which will occur on August 30. The
                        expedition will be organised and despatched under the auspices of the Lick
                        Observatory. Mr. W.W. Campbell, director of the Lick Observatory, recently
                        sent a communication to Secretary Shaw asking that permission bo given to
                        the collector of the port of Now York to examine a number of scientific
                        apparatus to be used in observing the eclipse. Included in the apparatus to
                        be brought out are lenses, prisms, mirrors, telescopes, clocks, photograph
                        apparatus and materials, tents, mechanics' tools and other minor
                        necessaries. Some of this apparatus is to bo taken from the United States
                        Naval Observatory at Washington, from Harvard University, and from
                        Princeton. The director stated that be would ship some of this late in May.
                        The expeditions will start July 6 from New York. He asked also that on the
                        return of the expeditions the instruments might be shipped in bond direct
                        various destinations, because an examination in Now York involved danger to
                        them on account of the unpacking and repacking. The Secretary of the
                        American Treasury has instructed the collector to make the requested
                        examination so that the instruments may be taken back without payment of
                        duty. Inasmuch as the expeditions are for advancing knowledge the department
                        makes this special ruling.</p>

                    <p>The erection of the now palatial pile, the largest of its kind in Cairo,
                        situated opposite the Savoy Hotel, is making rapid progress, and the
                        building will bo completed and ready for occupation by the end of the year.
                        Including the ground floor there will be no loss than five stories, besides
                        the basement, and the whole cost will be about £40,000, not including the
                        site of 1,810 square metres. The masonry work was given to Messrs. Guetin
                        and Charvand, the architect being Fabricius Pasha, who designed the handsome
                        National Bank buildings, whilst Mr. A. St John Dia-mant is the surveyor on

                        being constructed. The ground floor will be partly occupied by tho company
                        and partly let out as offices, and on the remaining four floors there will
                        be eighteen residential flats on the latest and most approved principles,
                        especially as regards the sanitary arrangements, which have been devised by
                        Dr. II. Nolan of Cairo, and are the most perfect and scientific in the
                        Capital. The rents of these apartments will range from £90 to £850 per
                        annum. Throe of the larger rooms of every flat will have English fireplaces,
                        whilst all the locks and grates as well as the lifts are being brought out
                        from England. We understand that most of the apartments have already been

                        Voronoff, consulting physician to H.H. the Khedive, has proved a great
                        success, judging by the large number of patients that have been admitted. Id
                        fact for several weeks during the winter many pressing cases had to be
                        refused admittance for want of accommodation. Miss Glewitt, the matron,
                        formerly lady doctor at the Suez Quarantine Office, and Miss Mac-phereon,
                        her assistant, have been kept busy since the opening. The latter has now
                        left for England owing to ill-health, but her place will be filled later by
                        another English nurse. The buildiug grounds surrounding were leased for four
                        years, with option of purchase, from Mohamed Boy Abdel Wahid, a wealthy
                        landlord of the Capital, and the gardenis 4,000 square metres in extent The
                        mansion contains over 20 rooms, but it is intended during the summer to make
                        several improvements and alterations which will increase the accommodation
                        for patients. Since the opening ho less than 106 cases have been treated in
                        the hospital, all ot which, with the exception of twelve, were surgical.
                        Besides paying patients there are also free beds for persons of
                        respectability who are unable from want of means to pay the fees. Dr. S.
                        Voronoff has left for Europe on a short and much-needed holiday and until

                    <p>Plans and contracts have been completed for four electric automobiles, each
                        to carry forty passengers at a trip, and an American youth as conductor, who

                        start running on the first of January next, from Shepheard's, stopping at
                        the Continental, Angleterre, National, and Savoy Hotels to pick up
                        passengers. The head porters in all those hotels are financially interested

                    <p>A shocking crime is reported from the village of Miniat El Kobra, in the
                        Menoofieh maiksz, Menoofieh province. A fellah, who had a grudge against his
                        brother, attacked him from behind while he was engaged in threshing his
                        wheat crop, and foiled the unfortunate man with several heavy blows of a
                        about. Unfastening his turban, the murderer coolly strangled his victim, and
                        having satisfied himself of his death, dragged the body to a neighbouring
                        canal and threw it into the water. The body was found floating in a partly
                        decomposed state, but the marks of the injuries sustained by the murdered
                        man persisted and the inquiry which was held established the brother's
                        guilt. The murderer, who was arrested, has confessed to having committed the
                        crime.</p>

                        <p>A seizure of 12 demijohns of what were described on the ship's manifest
                            and Customs declaration as mineral water took place at the custom house
                            to-day, through the intrepidity and zeal of the teftiche officer, Ali
                            Effendi 8abib, who called the attention of the local director (Mr. A. G.
                            Tarroll) to the matter. Although not this officer's special work he had
                            his doubts, and on one being unpacked in presence of the director at the
                            bottom hashish was found in cakes. Duty had already been paid on the
                            "mineral water," but the director felt it his duty to retain the
                            consignment for instruction from the Direction-General.</p>

                        <dateline>Port Said, Friday.</dateline>
                        <p>At 10 a-m. to-day all canal traffic was stopped north and south of Kil.
                            18. It appears that one of the "Couloir" dredgers, which has been
                            working in that locality for some weeks, had an accident to her
                            machinery, which has resulted in the breaking of the bucket wheel and
                            chain. These have fallen into the canal quite close to the axial line
                            and in consequence ships are tied up north and south of the point By
                            sundown six will be tied up to the south and five or six from the north.
                            Several vessels are at 8uez. Shear legs and divers have been despatched
                            to the scene under command of the port captain. </p>
                        <p>Port Said, Saturday. The Canal was clear again for traffio at 9 o'clock
                            last night The work of pumping and refloating the S S."Congai" will be
                            taken in hand at daylight on Monday.</p>
