                    <head>ALEXEIEFF'S RECALL.</head>
                    <p>Judging by yesterday's telegram announcing the appointment of Kuropatkin to
                        the supreme command and this morning's news of the departure of Alexeieff
                        for St. Petersburg, it seems to be practically certain that the Admiral has
                        been recalled. That officer, to whom, in the opinion of Europe at large,
                        most of the Russian misfortunes are to be attributed, is to be let down very
                        gently, as becomes the friend, if not more than the friend, of what is
                        generally known as the Grand Ducal Ring. He has been summoned to the capital
                        from the scene of his operations, strategic and financial, to give his
                        opinion on the situation to his Sovereign face to face. And it may be
                        prophesied with some confidence that if once he comes to St. Peters burg he
                        will never return to Manchuria.</p>
                    <p>The whole history of Admital Alexeieff's tenure of power is one which makes
                        his recall an earnest of better times for Russia, if things are not too far
                        gone already. It was to his utter misjudgment of the position, diplomatic
                        and military, that was due the unpreparedness of the Tsar's Government and
                        forces at the beginning of this year. To his unwarranted contempt for a
                        yellow race must be largely attributed, not only the blindness at the
                        headquarters of the Russian General Staff to facts which were notorious to
                        officers of other na<cb n="6"/>tions, but that general spirit of levity and
                        carelessness among the officers of all ranks and both arms, which led to the
                        earlier disasters on sea and land, and which still exists, according to
                        eye-witnesses, in Kuro patkin's army. To him, too, must be attri buted the
                        blundering and insolent diplomacy which flouted the Japanese, despised their
                        ability, and completely misjudged their determination. Alexeieff was
                        convinced they never would fight, and conducted the negotiations
                        accordingly. The truth, however, goes even deeper than this. Over the whole
                        sorry business of an avoidable war and continued disaster, lies the trail of
                        the financier. Admiral Alexeieff, the courtier, the intimate of the Royal
                        Family, was sent out, despite his inexperience of war and government, as
                        Viceroy of half an Empire, but he was sent, not to govern but to exploit.
                        Powerful interests at home were interested in the concessions in the Korean
                        forests, and Alexeieff was dispatched to watch over them, and in the
                        intervals of his financial occupations to play Russia's game against England
                        and Japan.</p>
                    <p>These facts seem to show that the position is at last thoroughly appreciated
                        at St. Petersburg, and that makes the prolongation of the war more assured
                        than ever. For now that the Tsar has learnt, if not the whole truth, at any
                        rate a great part of it, a different spirit should animate the Russian
                        services. The great obstacle to efficiency has been removed, and Kuropatkin
                        may be trusted to restore the much-needed discipline and "morale" of the
                        troops at the front. On him everything now depends, for he is now in chief
                        command.</p>

                    <head>THE LINKS OF A CHAIN.</head>
                    <p>From the Moayad to the Lewa is a far cry in many respects. Neither the
                        journals themselves nor their proprietors and editors can by any possibility
                        be coupled together by anyone at all acquainted with the character or
                        history of either the men or their journals. But in this world, as the
                        Buddhists say, no person or event stands alone. Everything has its action or
                        re-action, direct or indirect, throughout all space. The highest science of
                        the day confirms the doctrine that has thus come down to us from the long
                        past ages when the wondrous temples of the Buddha were yet solid and unhewn
                        rock. To use the time-honoured illustration of insignificant action, even
                        the harmless and, in Egypt, most necessary cat cannot sneeze with- out
                        causing a vibration of the ether that tra vels to the furthest limits of
                        space and re-acts, possibly, in originating a breeze that thereafter may
                        ruffle the whiskers of the cat. While infinitude itself is thus annihilated,
                        it is not sur prising that it is possible to trace an intimate connection
                        between mundane incidents that at first sight might appear to be more apart
                        than is the equator from the poles. Thus it happens that when in bygone
                        years the Sheikh Sadat, proud of his daughter's many accomplishments,
                        introduced her to the Sheikh Ali Youssef, he little thought that one result
                        of his doing so would be that Mustapha Pasha Kamel should write an
                        impertinent letter to his Highness the Khedive.</p>
                    <p>When the matrimonial affairs of the Sheikh Ali Youssef were first brought
                        before the public the Lewa, as might have been expected, seized the
                        opportunity as one likely to bring grist to its mill by deflecting some of
                        the popularity that the Moayad enjoyed to itself. But not content with using
                        his own journal for this purpose, the "Patriot," no doubt rightly judging
                        the very limited influence of his own organ, sought other channels and, as
                        it is said, instigated an article so flagrant in its style in another
                        journal that his Highness the Khedive at once issued a mandate forbidding
                        the "Patriot" access to the Mateh. Knowing well how much such an order must
                        discredit the claims he has always put forward to Khe divial support, the
                        "Patriot" wrote the letter that all Egypt is now discussing and that every
                        right-thinking man must condemn as an unpardonable outrage, one so gross and
                        so evident that henceforth to support the Lew or to countenance Mustapha
                        Pasha in any way will be to insult the Khedive. That it should be so is
                        probably as well for the interests of the country and its people, but surely
                        when the Sheikh Sadat introduced his daughter to the Sheikh Ali Youssef he
                        little imagined that in doing so he was starting a chain of events having
                        the discomfiture of the "Patriot" as one of its largest links.</p>

                                that he would not be allowed to coal or to take stores here. He
                                replied that his ships were damaged, which was the reason why he had

                                ing ahead of the fleet in the North Sea, was suddenly surrounded by
                                eight torpedo-boats. The transport asked for help. The battleship
                                division then advanced, and signalled the strangers to leave, or
                                state their nationality. The strangers refused to comply with the
                                order and advanced among the battleships. The report of a gun was
                                heard, whereupon the Russian Admiral, forming a line of battle,
                                replied to the fire, and, afterwards continued his voyage.</p>
                            <p>The Admiral knew that the Japanese had purchased torpedo-boats in
                                England, and, therefore, feared that the strangers were Japanese
                                torpedo vessels.</p>

                    <p>The new football and recreation ground at Abbassieh was opened on Saturday by
                        General Slade at 4 p.m. Great interest was taken in the opening and in the
                        football match between the 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, holders of the
                        Egyptian Shield for 1904, and the picked XI. of the Abbassieh Garrison.
                        Before the match opened the General in a brief speech hoped that the ground
                        would be a source of pleasure to the British Garrison, and expressed his
                        appreciation of the compliment paid him in naming the ground Slade's Park.
                        He then declared the ground open. When the teams had lined up on the field
                        the General, who was loudly cheered, kicked off for Abbassieh, who had lost
                        the toss, and sent the ball into the Inniskillings' quarters. The match
                        ended in a win for the latter team by 2 goals to nil. </p>

                    <p>Egyptian Stocks have been somewhat less active during the last week, but
                        prices shew very little sign of giving way. National Bank of Egypt old
                        shares have been well supported, and the price has risen to 211, and look
                        firm; the new standing at 5 premium. Land shares are steady. Agricultural
                        Banks are slightly lower for the moment at 94, the impending new e issue
                        being perhaps a factor against them; but they are not by any means a bad
                        market, and should be cheap at this price, as it will be some time before
                        the new issue comes out; but when it is brought on the market there should
                        be little doubt as to its success. Delta Deferred stand as high as 18-20,
                        there being no shares obtainable. At this price they should be worth
                        realizing. </p>
                    <p>In general markets, American Rails have a leading feature, and are
                        wonderfully strong, the tendency being towards still higher prices. The
                        South African Market looks good, and with a better tone there, other mining
                        sections should also improve, and Egyptian Mines should profit. Nile Valleys
                        keep very firm at 13. The Japanese victory has put a certain amount of check
                        on Paris speculation this week, but this effect is only likely to be
                        temporary as it should be pretty well discounted by now. </p>

                    <head>THE MUNICIPAL LANDS. <lb/> REGULATIONS OF SALE. </head>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipality has just issued draft regulations for the sale of
                        its lands. The has first draft was made in September, 1903, 18 F and so
                        there has been plenty of time since then to draw up a satisfactory set of
                        rules for the disposition of the property. We commence below the publication
                        of these pan draft regulations, but we do not think they Cus will meet with
                        general satisfaction, as some of the clauses are arbitrary and others are
                        drawn up that no business man could entertain them. For example, if Clauses
                        IV. and X. are Cas maintained, the result will be that intending purchasers
                        will be discouraged. According to Clause IV., the purchaser will have no
                        recourse against the Municipality in the case of a charge being found to
                        exist on the lands. According to Clause X. the Municipality, which demands
                        immediate payment, arrogates to itself the right to postpone the transfer of
                        the lands until two months afterwards. It is to be hoped that the Finance
                        Committee and the Contentieux Department of the Municipality will amend
                        these anomalies. </p>
                    <p>The following is the text of the regulations:- </p>
                    <p>ART. 1.-Les terrains de la Municipalité seront catalogués et un prix
                        d'évaluation sera at fixé pour chaque lot. Dans aucun cas, la vente de ces

                        l'évaluation. Ces prix seront revisés chaque année par le Comité
                        d'estimation et modifiés s'il y a lieu. </p>
                    <p>ART. 2.-Les terrains seront vendus par voie d'enchères publiques, lorsque la

                    <p>Toutefois une exception sera faite à cette règle dans le cas où le

                        bien de la Municipalité. Dans ce cas, les ter- Ba rains lui seront cédés au
                        prix d'estimation du go catalogue. La cession de terrains an Gouverne- ment
                        pourra également se faire par voie to d'échange. </p>

                    <p>Aida is always a popular opera to stage, Mr. and always will be, at any rate
                        so long as it is deck produced in the manner it was done last night Pow at
                        the Abbas Helmy Theatre. We always find the captious critic who is prepared
                        to cry down everything, however excellent it may be, that is produced at
                        this play-house, but few, we think, will be found to deny the credit that is
                        rightly due to the management for the mag-nificent interpretation given of
                        Verdi's opera. this Excellent as was the performance, it would have been
                        decidedly better did not untoward circumstances interfere with this
                        consumma- tion. In the first place, Sig. Cattadori fell ill and had to be
                        replaced at the last Oct moment in the role of Amonasro by Sig. Barrione,
                        who, notwithstanding,gave a distinctly good interpretation of the part. The
                        tenor, Sig. Venerandi, was not in his best form, and, ton to cap all, Signa.
                        Guerrina Fabri, whose reputa- tion is already firmly established,
                        unfortunately lost her voice just before the performance. Th Under these
                        conditions, it reflects all the more credit on those concerned for having
                        given such an admirable representation of the opera. Signs. Honoria
                        Popovici, another shining operatio "star," who, with Signa. Fabbri, made her
                        debut last night, was in splendid voice and gave a fine rendering of the
                        title role. In spite of Signa. Fabbri's indisposition, she also did ample
                        justice to her part as Amneris. Both artistes were accorded rousing recalls.
                        Sig. thi Venerandi was very good as Radames, Sig. Baldelli excellent as
                        Ramfis, and Sig. Queirolo thoroughly efficient as the King. The
                        orches-tration and mounting of the piece left abso- utely nothing to be
                        desired, and the choruses were worthy of especial praise. </p>
                    <p>ALHAMBRA THEATRE. </p>
                    <p>Messrs. Minard and Gardet were fortunate in staging Brieux' comedy, Les
                        Avariés. Last night's performance proved a great success, the house being
                        crowded, and albeit the piece deals with a delicate subject it has a moral
                        object. Messrs. Marmier and Silvestre had a difficult task which they filled
                        admirably, M those words which one would perhaps have left unsaid being
                        enunciated with due delicacy. Mile Leture was excellent in the second act,
                        and M. Lhostes was also good. Mme Bonen, as the nurse, did well. </p>

                    <p>"MEFISTOFELE." </p>
                    <p>On Monday last, we had a decidedly good P el performance of Boito's
                        Mefistofelé. The opera T, itself presents many features of interest. When u
                        originally produced in 1868 it failed as com-pletely as Carmen on its first
                        appearance, but is since 1875 it has been recognised as one of àthe finest
                        operas that modern Italy has pro-duced. The lack of any continuous binding
                        thread of interest is its main fault, but it contains scenes of very unusual
                        power and beauty, and in our opinion reproduces the spirit of la Goethe's
                        Faust far more successfully than Gounod's masterpiece. The garden scene is a
                        delightful piece of work. Margaret is here the Gretchen of Goethe's story,
                        an innocent and e simple child, instead of the voluptuously sen-timental
                        heroine of the French composer, and the delightful quartette ending in a
                        burst of e-half-childish, half-hysterical laughter is beyond de criticism.
                        Of the actors, Sig. Apostolu was in very good form and Sigua.
                        Marchesi-Coniglio de acted and sang well as Margaret, the part Tai suiting
                        her far better than that of Helen in the last 2 acts. Sig. F. Vecchioni took
                        the very difficult role of Mefistofele with energy and verve and met with a
                        large share of success. His rendering of the well-known "Ecco il Mon-do" was
                        really good. </p>

                    <head>THE COTTON MARKET </head>
                    <p>KEARSLEY AND CUNNINGHAM'S WEEKLY REPORT Liverpool, October 20.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian cotton has been in fair demand this week, and quotations of Brown,
                        are raised per lb. and Good Upper per. Ib.</p>
                    <p>In Futures a moderate business has been done, the following being the closing
                        quota tions:-</p>
                    <p>Octr. 7.48 Decr. 7.20 Feb. 7.10 April 7.9 Novr. 7.27 Jany. 7.12 Meh. 7,9 May
                        7.9 American Futures. The market this week has experienced constant
                        fluctuations, but the tone has been quiet, and prices have had a declining
                        tendency. To-day's closing values are generally 13 @ 15 points below those
                        of last Thursday. The decline is chiefly due to the continued heavy crop
                        movements, and favor able weather conditions; in addition, the Near
                        positions have been pressed for sale, and tenders against October delivery
                        have weighed upon the market, no one apparently caring, to handle the actual
                        cotton. We are now about the period when killing frost occurred last year,
                        and the temperature is still keeping fairly high. The general opinion seems
                        to be that if this year, there is no killing frost until later on, prices
                        will likely have a further, more or less, material decline. At any rate
                        there is considerable nervousness and hesitation, and people prefer to
                        operate very cautiously for the present.</p>
                    <p>The latest quotations are, delivery: October 5.27 Dec./Jan. 5.29 Mar./Apl.
                        6.89 Oct./Nov. 5.27 Jan./Feb. 5.30 Apl./May 5.33 Nov./Dec. 5.27 Feb./Mar.

                    <head>THE SUDAN.<lb/>IRRIGATION PROGRAMME,</head>
                    <byline>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector-General of Irrigation in
                        Lower re Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</byline>
                    <p>The proposals in Sir William Garstin's Report relating to the further
                        development of Egypt having now been passed in review, there remain to be
                        examined the proposals made in the interests of the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>A perusal of the reports and appendices contained in the Blue-book make this
                        one point clear namely, that knowledge of the data necessary for the
                        preparation of projects is the T most urgent need. Throughout the report are
                        e scattered reminders that the data made use of w are assumptions or
                        guesses, at the best based on probabilities. Consequently it is not
                        surpris-le ing to find Lord Cromer declaring, in his w covering despatch,
                        that "all that it is proposed E to do for the moment is to spend L.E. 24,000
                        ait year on the employment of a competent staff) to examine more closely
                        into some of the various projects to which Sir William Garstin of has
                        directed attention." All that Sir William I professes to do in his report is
                        to indicate the w different projects requiring study.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed, then, and practically decided, m to form an irrigation
                        service in the Sudan, subject to the control of the Ministry of Public in
                        Works in Egypt, the necessity for such control being indisputable. A great
                        step towards success has been made in appointing Mr. C. E. Dupuis head of
                        the new service, and in giving him Mr. P. M. Tottenham as his assistant, a
                        combination of talent and energy which has already done much to improve the
                        irrigation system of the Central Delta in Egypt. The only objection to this
                        arrangement is that Egypt must lose their services so long as they are given
                        to the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested, by critics of the Egyptian Government that the study
                        of the h Upper Nile problems by competent engineers, E with their
                        headquarters in the Sudan, might have been set on foot some years ago, after
                        the battle of Omdurman. Probably this was not e done on account of the
                        difficulty of finding the u money and the men. But Egypt could have found
                        L.E. 24,000 easily for some years past; S and I imagine that it is no easier
                        now than it was a few years ago for Egypt to spare its irrigation,
                        officers.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me, moreover, a subject for regret that the men who accompanied
                        the chiefs of the various expeditions to the Upper Nile, made since 1898,
                        were not selected from among those who might now become members of the Sudan
                        Irrigation Service, and who would be more useful in the preliminary
                        operations) of the service if they already possessed a general knowledge of
                        the country. The con- venience of Egypt was no doubt consulted, and those
                        officers were taken who could best be spared.</p>
                    <p>The different projects requiring study are given by Sir W. Garstin, in what
                        he considers their order of importance, as below:- (1) Open barrage near Wad
                        Medani on the Blue Nile.</p>
                    <p>(2) Dam and storage reservoir near Rosaires on the Blue Nile.</p>
                    <p>(3) River Gash irrigation.</p>
                    <p>(4) Dam and storage reservoir near Khashm- el-Girba on the Atbara River.</p>
                    <p>(5) Storage Reservoirs on the Dinder and Rahad rivers.</p>
                    <p>(6) Storage reservoirs on the Upper Atbara. It will, perhaps, be most
                        convenient to exa mine the proposals, grouped with reference to the rivers
                        affecting then, under the following heads</p>
                    <p>(1) Blue Nile projects." (2) River Gash project. (3) River Atbara projects.
                        (4) Berber to Khartoum proposals. It is as well to deal with the questions
                        of the Blue Nile first, as determining the general irrigation policy that it
                        may be best to adopt for the Sudan. In the first place, let us dispose of
                        the question of the utilisation of Lake Tsana in Abyssinia as a storage
                        reservoir. Mr. Dupuis visited and made the circuit of this lake in January
                        and February, 1903. His observations show that Lake Tsana cannot claim to be
                        the source of the Blue Nile, for, as Sir W. Garstin remarks, if Mr. Dupuis'
                        calculations are in any way accurate, "it is evident that this lake plays a
                        very small part indeed in the flood discharge of the Blue Nile, and that its
                        in- fluence upon the volume of the river is extreme- ly limited." This,
                        however, is in its favour 95 A possible storage reservoir, as control <cb
                            n="2"/> of the discharge at its outlet into the G river Abai-Blue
                        Nile-would not incon-veniently affect the conditions of the n river within
                        the Sudan territory. More e over, the knowledge that Lake Tsana has of so
                        little influence upon the river discharge o removes the fear, once felt,
                        that Abyssinia, in under the influence of a Power hostile to a Egypt, might
                        control the outflow of the lake in such a manner as to seriously affect the
                        th welfare of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Before calculating what the possibilities of Lake Tsana as a storage
                        reservoir may be, it will be as well to note what the natural dis-charges of
                        the Blue Nile are, and what supplementing they require at different seasons.
                        The flood discharge varies from 7,000 to 12,000 b cubic metres a second,
                        sufficient for all land w within reach. If the Sudan abstracts so con- C
                        siderable a portion of the flood as to affect the levels of the Nile in
                        Egypt materially, this b will be a matter of no consequence when all d Egypt
                        is converted to perennial irrigation. It it is not so converted, then Egypt
                        must meet the situation by making barrages to produce artificially the
                        levels required, as the volume of the flood will be always more than
                        sufficient. In high floods the reduction of the flood levels will be a
                        relief to Egypt. So we may conclude that the flood supply is equal to all
                        requirements, since a discharge of 2,000 cubic metres a second would fill
                        one million acres of basin C in thirty days; though what the possible basin
                        area may become is one of those things which are not yet determined.</p>

                    <p>Much sympathy is felt at Vienna with the celebrated authoress, Helene
                        Boehlau, in her matrimonial troubles. She married a Turk, Al Rashid. After
                        eighteen years of happiness Al Rashid is claimed by his first wife, to whom
                        he had been united years before he met Miss Helene Boehlau. The latter is a
                        lady of great sensitiveness. She was born the daughter of a well-known
                        Weimar publisher, and at the early age of twenty had already written three
                        ultra-pessimistic novels. It was at that time that her future husband gained
                        power over her. She followed him to Constantinople, where she embraced Islam
                        and soon married him. At the same time she wrote a book, "Guilty, though of
                        Pure Heart," in which she explained in a romantic form the reasons for her
                        decisive step, which shocked her former friends in Weimar.</p>

                    <head>THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT. </head>
                    <p>An interesting statement has been published about a conversation between Dr.
                        Herzl, the pro-tagonist of Zionism, and Count Bulow, whom he met on two
                        occasions. Both times Dr. Herzl tried to interest the German Chancellor for
                        the scheme he had so near at heart. Count Bulow says he has never seen a
                        more barren land than Palestine, and feels sure that none of the wealthier
                        or better class Jews would ever agree to emigrate to that country. The lower
                        classes who would be ready to go there are not made of the stuff to build
                        empires in the desert, and do not even form a good nucleus for a new colony.
                        The Count thinks that the rich and educated Jews in all civilised countries
                        are so much interwoven with the interests and prosperities of their adopted
                        homes that emigration is quite out of the question. He admits the miserable
                        condition of the Eastern Jews, and thinks something should be done to assist
                        them. However, Palestine is not the place for them, and he believes that in
                        spite of past failures the colonisation scheme in the Argentine Republic is
                        the most likely to succeed in the end.</p>

                    <dateline>Athens, 20th October.</dateline>
                    <p>Chiefly, if not entirely, owing to the reports in the European Press of
                        memorial services held in various parts of Greece, praying for the success
                        of the Russian arms in the war with Japan, and for the salvation of the
                        souls of the Russian dead, there would appear to be a belief that the Greeks
                        are enthusiastic sup- porters of Russia in the war now raging in the Far
                        East. Nothing, however, could be more opposed to the actual state of feeling
                        among Greeks of all classes and politics, with the doubtful exception of the
                        Church, though it is not easy to understand why this exception even should
                        exist seeing that in all quarters of the Near East the Russian Church openly
                        or secretly working to undermine the influence and power of the Greek
                        Patriarchate and bishops.</p>
                    <p>In Palestine and in Macedonia the story is the same, and it is more
                        accentuated perhaps in Mount Athos, where the Russians, and their protégés
                        the Bulgarians, are rapidly ousting the Greek monks from the holy mountain.
                        Ignorance, one of the chief characteristics, if indeed not an indispensable
                        qualification of the Greek priesthood, has for some time past blinded the
                        eyes of the clergy to the work which Russia is carrying on against the Greek
                        Church, as opposed to the Russo-Greek, and though most of the more educated
                        clergy are becoming aware of the Russian designs, they do not yet give
                        public effect to their views in the matter, unlike the Press, which is daily
                        in- forming the public of the growing danger.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the fact that Russia is one of the "protecting Powers" of Greece,
                        official Greece Considers itself bound to give public expression to its
                        official prayers and wishes for the success of the "protecting Power," but
                        the private opinions of the various Mayors and others who have (in some
                        cases on their own initiative) convoked services on behalf of the Russian
                        arms, must, we will hope, have been left on the threshold of the church in
                        most instances.</p>
                    <p>THE PRIEST'S ARGUMENT.</p>
                    <p>I have had the curiosity to ask several priests the reason for these
                        services, and invariably met with the same answer to all intents and
                        purposes: "Well, we are obliged to pray for the success of the Christians
                        against the heathen." On my asking if this applied to any differences which
                        might possibly arise between Bulgaria and Turkey for instance, they remarked
                        that the case was different, as the Bulgarians are not real Christians in
                        that they murder and persecute their Christian Greek brethren in
                        Macedonia.</p>
                    <p>When I recall certain incidents connected with Russians and Chinese during
                        the late international expedition to Pekin, and with the Russian occupation
                        of Manchuria, they replied: "Yes, it is true, and we know that the Russians
                        are barbarous, but what can we do, they are our protectors." Sometimes the
                        addition is made that the expression of sympa thy with Russia is due to a
                        desire to avoid offending the Queen, who, though a Greek Queen, never
                        forgets that she was first a Rus- sian Grand Duchess. This argument must be
                        a new one, as the idea of avoiding offence to the Queen had no existence
                        during the war of 1897.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that Greeks remember Navarino, and that Russian ships took part
                        in that battle they may remember that it was not Russia which described that
                        action as an "untoward event." They remember that Russia has conti- nually
                        fought Greece's old enemy Turkey, and they remember that a telegram from the
                        Rusnian Emperor stayed the conquering Turk out- side Lamia and put an end to
                        his advance during the disastrous war of 1897, but they do not forget that
                        Russia poses as the champion of Pan Slavism, which spells annihilation to
                        Greece and Greek aspirations in every quarter. They are not dead to the
                        shortcomings of the Russian race and policy, and in the words which a former
                        Prime Minister of Greece used to me in speaking of the present war, they
                        feel that in this war, at any rate, "the victory or Russia would be the
                        victory of barbarism and the victory of wrong."</p>
                    <p>To return to the memorial services, in none</p>
                    <p>of these has such enthusiasm been evinced as in the case of the Boer war,
                        when a British victory was received with as much enthusiasm as if it had
                        been a Greek victory, not because of any feeling against the Boers, whose
                        bravery and stubbornness they admired as much as any people, but because
                        they were persuaded that the victory of Great Britain would be the vic- tory
                        of progress and right.</p>

                        visit is said to be connected with the probability of the connection of the

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir, In view of the many and important successes obtained both on land
                            and sea by the Japanese forces during the few months that have elapsed
                            since the commencement of the Russo-Japanese war, it may appear absurd
                            to use such a term as failure in connection with the consummately
                            skilful operations of the Japanese; but calm consi- deration of past and
                            intelligent anticipation of probable future events point unmistakably to
                            the conclusion that, so far, the net result of Japan's attack on Russia
                            is-failure.</p>
                        <p>The one prime necessity for Japan was that she should strike a series of
                            staggering blows at her enemy to obtain such a com- manding position in
                            Manchuria before Russia T could rally from them, that she would be in
                            the position to dictate terms of peace F and gain the ends she sought.
                            Russia was admittedly unready for war and Japan was led to believe from
                            the reports of her many spies that success would attend her venture.
                            Eight months have elapsed since the first blow was struck, and what is
                            the situation today? At an enormous cost of life and treasure Japan has
                            inflicted defeat after defeat upon the Russians, only to find her armies
                            still south of Mukden and a triple line of defences between her and the
                            ancient capital of Man- charia that certain newspapers (don't blush, Mr.
                            Editor) so confidently anticipated would be in her possession as a
                            consequence of the recent battle; while the Russians themselves were
                            expecting that their army would have retreated to Harbin before now (and
                            it has been freely stated that Kuropatkin himself contemplated the
                            possibility of the step be- coming necessary), and the general
                            expectation was that before the advent of winter, the Japanese would
                            have established a new govern- ment throughout Manchuria. A glance at
                            the map will show how far the performance has fallen short of the
                            anticipation.</p>
                        <p>And now that the completion of the circum- Baikal railway enables Russia
                            to pour in fresh supplies of men and material practically ad. lib.,
                            while the Baltic fleet (a somewhat substantial "bogey") is well on its
                            way to the Far East and may possibly give the supremacy on the sea to
                            Russia, surely it is too late to expect Japan to bring off a
                            coup-de-main.</p>
                        <p>Has not the time come for her to reconsider her position and take into
                            account future possi- bilities?</p>
                        <p>Were she to lose the command of the sea what would be the position of her
                            forces in Manchuria 7 In all probability Japanese sol- diers would
                            prefer death to surrender and a loss of life fearful to contemplate
                            would ensue. Bereft of the flower of its manhood, what possible chance
                            would the nation have for many a long year of continuing that wonderful
                            progress that has called forth the world's admiration in recent
                            years?</p>
                        <p>Japan should "be wise-and be wise in time." I write entirely without bias
                            and from what I wish to be an unprejudiced point of view, simply dealing
                            with established facts and reasonable probabilities. If I have any lean-
                            ings at all I must admit that they are in favour of the white, rather
                            than the yellow race, and it rather surprises me to find the sympathies
                            of most Englishmen so passionately enlisted on the side of the latter.
                            For I doubt if the success of Japan would be to the advant- age of the
                            world at large, apart from any question of what is termed the "Yellow
                            Peril." I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>What was the cost of the battle of Liao-yang! This is how an expert in the
                        manufacture of munitions reckons it up. There were 125,000 Russians and
                        150,000 Japanese. Deducting reserves and allowing for the fact that all
                        conld not be fighting at once, some 60,000 Russians and 80,000 Japanese were
                        fighting for sixty hours, consuming 1,200 cartridges par man, or a total of
                        sixty millions, worth £400,000. The 300 cannon used in the battle fired some
                        450,000 shells at an average price of 88., or a total of £180,000. These
                        sums do not, of course, include the cost of repairing the guns and cannon,
                        and after two or three battles like that of Liao-yang they will all require
                        serious attention. The Japanese field-guns cost about £400 each. The big
                        guns defending Port Arthur go to £40,000, and fire away £50 at every shot.
                        Up to the present the Japanese Government has spent on war material some
                        £12,000,000, and the Russian double that sum, so that in all some
                        £36,000,000 have come out of the different arsenals of Europe and Asia.</p>
