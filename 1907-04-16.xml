                            boxing burlesque. Mr. Brosa also introduces a couple of well-trained
                            dogs. Another turn worthy of note is that of Les Sarraux, Spanish
                            duettists and dancers, receiving well-(leserved applause. The rest of
                            the programme includes The Sisters Litine, aerobatic dancers, who work
                            very hard, Mlle Gaby, who has a good voice, and several artists of the
                            French music hall type. Altogether to variety lovers the show is worth a
                            visit. </p>

                        <p>It has been suggested that the prospects of sugar cultivation might be
                            improved in two ways : first, by the promotion of experiments with a
                            view to selecting the most productive varieties of cane ; secondly, by
                            the extension of railway communication to the newly. converted basin
                            lands in the Ibrahimieh region. As a result of the first suggestion, a
                            number of experiments have been carried on by the Agri. cultural Society
                            on the lands of individual cultivators. The crops are being harvested
                            and promise satisfactory results. The Society has, at the same time,
                            been in communication with other countries. With regard to the second
                            inatter, the question of opening up railway commůnication with the
                            western portion of the Ibrahimieh region is under consideration, but it
                            is doubtful whether the new lines would offer any reasonable prospects
                            of a fair return on the capital outlay unless rates were considerably
                            raised. It might also very well be that the construction of these lines
                            would operate in favour of the cultivation of crops other than
                            sugar.</p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER'S RESIGNATION.<lb/>THE PROPOSED MEMORIAL.<lb/>NATIVE MUNICIPAL
                        ATTITUDE.</head>
                    <p>The unanimous manner in which the native members of the Alexandria
                        Municipality abstained from attending Sunday's meeting is the subject of
                        universal comment. The Alexandria Municipality is the most important
                        representative institution that exists in Egypt, and consequently the
                        boycotting by the natives of the movement to present a memorial to Lord
                        Cromer is of some significance. At the same time it must be remembered that
                        none of the natives in the Municipal Commission have any claim to be
                        considered as representative men, for only a single one of them has been
                        elected. They have been nominated by the Government because, ac. cording to
                        the constitution of the Municipality a certain number of persons have to be
                        nominated, and the present Egyptian nominees were selected because they were
                        supposed to be less prejudiced representatives of their race, owing to their
                        contact with Europeans. They may be considered to be more or less
                        representative of the native capitalist class in Alexandria, and for this
                        reason their attitude deserves to be taken into consideration. As an excuse,
                        it has been adduced that they think that, inas much as Lord Cromer is going,
                        while the potent influences az nat him and all that he has represented still
                        remain, therefore they are wise in maintaining an attitude which will be
                        sure to be favourably considered in high places. From their own point of
                        view they no doubt must be considered to be guided by prudential motives.
                        The question of whether or not Yebia Pasha will serve on the committee
                        chosen at Smmday's meeting of the Alexandria Municipality is much discussed.
                        The fact that each member of this committee was selected to represent a
                        nationality lends additional importance to the choice of Yehia Pasha to
                        represent the Egyptians. Yehia Pasha is nominated by the Egyptian Government
                        to his seat on the Alexandria Municipal Commission, as, in fact, are all the
                        other native members, with the sole exception of Soliman Bey Abani, who is
                        elected by the suffrages of the landlords. Consequently Yehia cannot well
                        refuse to act, as if he did şo it would be taramount to a repudiation of the
                        authority by which he holds his seat. As we said yesterday the best excuse
                        thie Pasha can make is that he was so unwell that he could not attend the
                        meeting on Sunday and that he is quite willing to serve on the
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand his Excellency may have the courage of Nationalist opinions
                        and as a devoted follower of Mustapha Pasha Kamel he may boldly refuse to
                        serve on the committee in the name of "The Egyptian Nation." If he takes the
                        determined course he will at once be raised to the foremost rank among
                        Egyptian patriots and will be praised effusively in the columns of the
                        "Egyptian Standard." Yehia Pasha, in fact, has to make his choice once and
                        for all. If he decide to serve on the Committee he will be exposed to the
                        objurgations of the vernacular Moslem Press as a time-server, while if he
                        refuses to cast in his lot with all the European members of the commission,
                        he will be hailed as one of those noble creatures who have refused to
                        truckle to the brutal oppression of his country</p>
                    <p>PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the native members of the Municipality is, as was to be
                        expected, eulogissed by Mustapha Pasha Kamel The French cilition of "Al
                        Lewa" says : --</p>
                    <p>The dignity and propriety of their attitude has been keenly appreciated in
                        Alexandria, and it will be much talked about throughout Egypt. Lord Cromer
                        has, during nearly twentyfive years, governed Egypt as absolute master, for
                        the English, against e Egyptians. Let the English be grateful to him for it
                        ; it is their duty ; let the Egyptians have no feeling of sympathy : that is
                        their duty. In his last report - his farewell to Egypt-he has again laid
                        stress npon his policy and his antipathy for the Egyptians. Not content with
                        refusing them all that they with justice ask, he attacks, after having
                        scoffed at their patriotism, their religion, Islam, which he has accused of
                        being the obstacle to the civilisation and progress of the country over
                        which he reigns. The Egyptians ove him no mask of affection, 10 homage of
                        'sympathy. But they owe him the silent deference due to the conquered ; for
                        it is as a conquered màn that Lord Cromer goes away. The failure of his
                        policy is the true reason of his departure. What then must the Egyptian
                        members of the Alexandria Municipality do ? Abstain ; that was at the same
                        time the most dignified and the most patriotic treatment Haid they attended
                        the meeting they would only have been able to protest against the eulogies
                        paid to the political enemy of Egypt and Islam. The lesson of silence (they
                        understood it, and the whole world will hear of it with pleasure) was the
                        noblest and the strongest.</p>
                    <p>"Les Nouvelles", commenting upon the absence of the native members, says :-
                        It was in every reqpect an inopportune manifestation. The abstention of the
                        native counsellors was undoubtedly legitimate. But in presence of the work
                        which I ord Cromer leaves, one cannot, under penalty of ingratitude,
                        obstinately declare it as bad, as those native counsellors appear to have
                        done who did not go to express the thanks, which the Khedive himself
                        believed it his duty to do, to the representative of the British
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>"La Réforme" says :-- It was their right, assuredly, and we would be tempted
                        to commend them for their attitude precisely because we estimate frankness
                        above all. Yet these coun sellors might have attended the meeting and they
                        might equally have taken part in the vote without being false to the ideas
                        of which they are the two often discreet partisans,</p>

                    <p>The Comte de Serionne was unanimously elected to take the chair, and, after
                        expressing his appreciation of the honour, referred in eloquent terms to the
                        great loss Egypt had sugtained by the resignation of Lord Cromer. He took it
                        that the present meeting was mainly to nominate an actual committee with
                        sub-committee in order to arrive at a decision as to in what form the
                        European community could best perpetuate their recognition of the great and
                        lasting work carried out in Egypt by Lord Cromer. </p>
                    <p>A general and somewhat desultory disorssion ensued, and the question was
                        raised as to whether the proposed memorial or monument ! was to be
                        international in the strict sense of the word, i.e. whether members of the
                        native community should be asked to associate themselves with the European
                        communities in the movement. It was pointed out that a committee, having in
                        view the same purpose as that now sitting, had already been formed in
                        Alexandria, and a member suggested that the two committees should exchange
                        views, and possibly co-operate with one another. Nothing was known as to the
                        constitation of the Alexandria committee, whether such committee was
                        distinct from that of the Municipality, and whether the committee was
                        actually international in character or composed solely of members of the
                        European communities. </p>
                    <p>After lengthy discussion it was decided to elect a sub-committee, composed of
                        the Comte de Serionne, (president) Messrs. Maurice Cattaui Bey, Manusardi,
                        Pelizaeus, Rowlatt, and Rostovitz Buy.</p>
                    <p>This sub-committee are to exchange views with Alexandria, and draw up
                        propositions to be submitted to the general committee.</p>
                    <p>The question as to the form of the memorial was discussed at length. It was,
                        however, left over for consideration by the sub-committee, and Mr.
                        Harrison's suggestion that Lord Cromer himself should be consulted on the
                        question met with unanimous support.</p>

                        Limited, will take special pains to be represented at the forthcoming
                        extraordinary general meeting of the company, which is to be held at the

                        object for which the meeting is convened is to consider the question of the
                        modification of the statutes of the company with a view to transferring the
                        entire management from London to Cairo. To-day is the last day on which the
                        local shareholders who want to be represented at this meeting, should place
                        their shares with the Anglo.. Egyptian Bank at Cairo and Alexandria. | The
                        necessity for this radical change in the constitution of the company has
                        long been obvious as it is evident that in such an essentially local
                        business, which caters solely for residents in this country, it is highly
                        necessary to have a local board of directors, whose actions are neither
                        controlled nor impeded from London. The London board of Walker and
                        Meimarachi Limited has not been a signal success and has considerably

                        entitled to retire on pension. The news will be received with a great deal
                        of regret throughout Egypt and also in England where the Pasha's services on
                        behalf of the Egyptian Post Office are well-known and deservedly appre.

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN LOURDES. <lb/>THE MARBLE CITY OF MARIOUT.</head>
                    <p>It is almost incredible that the ruins of a celebrated city, the holiest site
                        in Christian Egypt, could have remained unknown for nine hundred years in
                        the immediate neighbourhood of such a populous centre as Alexandria.
                        Although it was well known that the site of the City of Saint Menas, the
                        Patron Saint of Christian Egypt, did exist in the Mariout district, it was
                        not until less than two years age that the wonderful remains of the holy
                        city were brought to light by the researches of two German archieologists.
                        The city lies a few hours ride to the north of Beheig on the Khedive's
                        railway in a breezy upland tract, 29 metres above sea level. The surrounding
                        district is uninhabited save by a few Bedouin and lies away from any desert
                        highway except that followed by the hashish smugglers, who lead their camels
                        on dark nights near the old city on their way to Delingat, where hashish can
                        more safely be disposed of than at Mex or Alexandria. The country round is a
                        bleak expanse of steppe, cultivated here and there with barley, the green
                        surface often varied by low mounds, relics of ancient habitations. Far away
                        in the south runs a line of rising country, the haunt of the gazelle. Here
                        the desert plateau begins and continues unbroken until the Wady Natron is
                        reached. But in ancient times when Nitria, was one of the greatest centres
                        of Monasticism in Christendom, the home of thirty thousand monks, and the
                        City of Saint Menas, the most revered shrine in Egypt, there must have been
                        a considerable traffic from Alexandria by this ronte for the city lay on the
                        direct track to the Natron Valley and its fifty monasteries, from which it
                        is a ten hours ride on horseback. </p>
                    <p>*THE ANCIENT CITY.</p>
                    <p>Even in its present state of desolation it is easy to see the magnificence of
                        the ancient city. The profusion of marble is extraordinary and the choicest
                        samples lie about everywhere amidst the ruins. The churches, monasteries and
                        basilicas were all of marble and the great marble basilica of the Emperor
                        Arcadius must have been visible for miles and miles throughout Mariout. No
                        doubt this profusion of to marble came from the Serapeum, for in the to
                        reign of Theodosius, the father of Arcadius, the extirpation of paganism
                        took place, of which the destruction of the great temple of Alexandria was
                        one of the results. </p>
                    <p>The town was exclusively a city of pilgrim-lo age, an Egyptian Lourdes, and
                        hither came crowds from all parts of Christendom. The world-wide sanctity of
                        the spot is evident by the fact that there is not a museum in Europe which
                        has not one or more specimens of the terra-cotta flasks (ampullie) of the
                        holy water; of Saint Menas, which the pilgrims brought back with them to
                        their homes in Europe. There is a fine collection of one hundred and sixty
                        of these ampullæ at the Alexandria Museums and good samples are to be found
                        in the British Museum, the National Library at Paris, the Museums at
                        Florence and Berlin and elsewhere. There is also in the British Museum an
                        exquisite ivory vase with scenes from the life of Saint Menas engraved upon
                        its sides. </p>
                    <p>SAINT MENAS,</p>
                    <p>church ho gave forthas soon as h</p>
                    <p>The Patron Saint of Christian Egypt was a soldier, who was martyred in
                        Phrygia in one! of the Diocletian persecutions (296 A D.). The 1 body was
                        brought to Alexandria and placed upon a camel, which was let loose to follow
                        what course it chese In the place the camel stopped, near Lake Mareotis,
                        &amp; grave was made and a shrine subsequently built. Menas belonged to a
                        good family, his father being the Governor of an African Province, and he
                        was an officer in the army when he refused to renounce Christianity. His
                        martyrdom therefore made some stir and as soon as he was buried his tomb
                        gave forth miraculous - powers. A 1 church was built there and soon a town
                        sprang up owing to the lacrative pilgrimage traffic The fame of the Saint
                        went on increasing and a great basilica was erected in the reign of Arcadius
                        (395-408 A.D.). Even after the Moslem conquest Orthodox and Jacobite Copts
                        struggled to possess the sanctuary. Sabsequent to the terrible outbreak of
                        Moslem fanaticism under the Caliph El-Hakim (9951021 A.D.) when the great
                        destruction of Christian Churches took place all traces of the ancient city
                        disappeared, for the last extant account of it is from an unknown Arab
                        traveller who visited it probably in the tenth century. The description is
                        contained in a manuscript in the Paris Library and is as follows :- "
                        Leaving Tarraneh and following the road towards Barca, one comes to Mena,
                        whch consists of three abandoned towns, in the midst of a sandy desert, with
                        their buildings still standing. The Arabs use it as a place for lying in
                        wait for travellers. There may be seen lofty and well built palaces with
                        enclosure walls around them. They are for the most part built over vaulted
                        colonnades and some few serve as dwellings for monks. There are some springs
                        of fresh water but they are somewhat scanty Next one comes to the Church of
                        Saint Menas, a huge building decorated with statues and paintings of the
                        greatest beauty. There tapers burn day and night without ceasing. At one end
                        of the church is a vast tomb with two camels in marble, and upon them the
                        statue of a man' carved in marble, who is standing with one</p>
                    <p>foot upon each camel. One of his hands is open i and the other closed. This
                        statue is said to </p>
                    <p>represent Saint Menas. On the right as you </p>

                        Messrs. Reiser and Binder, Alexandria. </p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>enter the church is a great marble column, in which a shrine is carved
                        containing figures of Jesus, John and Zacharias...... There is also to be
                        seen a statue of the Virgin Mary, hidden by two curtains, and statues of all
                        the prophets. Outside the church are figures representing all kinds of
                        animals and men of all ocoupations. Among others is a slave merchant holding
                        in his hand a purse upside down. Over the midst of the church is &amp; dome
                        beneath which are eight figures said to represent angels. Close to the
                        church is a mosque, where the Moslems come to pray..All the surrounding
                        land. is planted with fruit trees. The fruit is very good and used for
                        making syrup. There are also a great many vines from which which wine is
                        made." </p>
                    <p>This description proves that for long after the Arab conquest, although the
                        city was uninhabited, yet it was still intact, bat the anknown Arab
                        traveller wrote these lines in the tanth century before the opnquest of
                        England by the Normans and from that time until June, 1905, the marble city
