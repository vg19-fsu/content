                                Liaoyang-Woping consisted of a division of infantry, 30 squadrons of
                                cavalry, and 4 batteries of artillery. The attack began at 2 and
                                ended at 8 a.m., when the Russians were outflanked. He makes no

                            <p>The Hon. C. Hardinge has brought the sinking of the "St. Kilda" to
                                the attention of Count Lamsdorff, pointing out the gravity of the
                                situation arising from such incidents, and asking for reparation,
                                and that immediate steps should be taken to render the repetition of
                                similar cases impossible. Count Lamsdorff promised to refer the
                                matter to the Minister of Marine, and added that last year's
                                assurances to Great Britain still hold good. The case of the "St.
                                Kilda" is an isolated one, and is probably due to a
                                misunderstanding. (Reuter.</p>

                        <p> Yesterday morning a Coptic resident of Zeitoun, Mr. Mickail Escaros, of
                            the Free State Lands Department, was run over and cut to pieces on the
                            railway line at the station crossing. The deceased leaves a family of
                            seven in rather distressed circumstances. Only a short time ago an
                            accident occurred at this same crossing when a cart was smashed up by a
                            passing train. There is a gate at one side only of this crossing, the
                            opposite side being entirely unprotected. Another crossing, used
                            principally by pedestrians, is also in the same half-guarded state at
                            the other end of Zeitoun station, and it would seem worth while
                            constructing gates to prevent further loss of life and property at this

                    <head>THE MAHMAL THEFT. ANDRAOUS'S ANTECEDENTS.</head>
                    <p>Let us hope that Andraous Meloka has no rivals in his art. A thief, who can
                        board a moving train and drop off with his booty unobserved and uninjured,
                        is a redoubtable opponent of society in general and the Railway
                        Administration in particular. We are now assured that Andraous was never
                        employed by the railway authorities. He certainly appears to have given them
                        a good deal of employment, for was not he condemned to six years
                        imprisonment in 1895 for a series of daring and ingenious train robberies ?
                        Now we are assured that he was employed by the police, no doubt on the
                        principle of set a thief to catch a thief but the report is unfounded.
                        Andraous' time has been too much taken up of late years. Condemned for
                        burglary in 1888 by the Native Court of Appeal, he took to train robbery on
                        his release from prison until 1895. After being employed for some years in
                        the buildings of the Prisons Department he returned to the world and stole
                        jewels at Shoubra. Six months and life at Assiout under the observation of
                        the authorities were the result, and now, Andraous has performed his boldest
                        and his last exploit.</p>
                    <p>He denied any participation in the crime before the Parquet, but that was
                        only to be expected. His confederates also denied it, which was rather
                        remarkable, for the honor that is said to exist among thieves seldom
                        prevents at least one member of a gang from giving the authorities full
                        information of his comrades misdeeds when he has been laid by the beels.</p>
                    <p>"Cherchez la femme" was the motto of the Parquet, and on Sunday Andraous'
                        wife appeared for examination. Her statement was clear, enough. Four months
                        ago her husband came home with Makarius and Ibrahim Ashour, told his wife
                        not to disturb them, and shut himself up with his friends. With the
                        curiosity of her sex the Sitt Meloka listened and heard the clinking of
                        coin. The trio were obviously dividing the "swag."</p>
                    <p>Andraous had made a capital error in not sending his wife out of the house or
                        looking her in her room. He was soon to make another. After seeing his
                        friends off the premises he presented his spouse with a handkerchief full of
                        sovereigns and bade her guard them. A few days later he made a hole in the
                        wall and there hid a tin box containing the coins; sis wife wondered where
                        they came from, and Andraous weakly told the story and sealed his fate.</p>
                    <p>Mansfield Pasha and Goubran Bay Moskat have supplied Mr. Machell with the
                        results of the inquiry up to date. The decision of the Ministry of War, with
                        regard to the members of the military escort which was of such little use in
                        guarding the treasure, may be deferred till the enquiry has brought to light
                        all the circumstances of the robbery.</p>

                        owing to press of work the office has been occupied and lighted up to 10
                        p.m. It is curious that on the night in question he did not notice anything,
                        and his conduct is suspicions.</p>

                    <p>An eye-witness gives us the following ac- count of Sunday's riot in the
                        Moharrem Bey quarter:-</p>
                    <p>"At about 2 p.m. on Sunday a dispate broke out in one of the smaller streets
                        in the Mohar- rem Bey quarter between a Greek and an Arab arbaghi over the
                        fare. Blows soon succeeded words; Greeks and Arabs rushed to the rescue of
                        the respective combatants, and a free fight followed. The Greeks, however,
                        were two or three in number, while the Arabs were reinforc ed by scores of
                        their compatriots, who rushed up from all the neighbouring streets and
                        lanes. Overpowered by numbers the Greeks fled, one of them who fell was
                        overtaken, badly beater, and kicked, and only saved by the timely arrival of
                        a shawish.</p>
                    <p>"A Greek grocery and a Greek tobacco shop were also attacked and much damaged
                        by showers of stones and other missiles. The shop boys were ill-treated and
                        but for the coura- geous intervention of several respectable Arabs who were
                        disgusted by the conduct of the crowd, very serious damage to property would
                        have ensued. It is stated that sticks were served out to the mob by an Arab,
                        but I am unable to confirm this.</p>
                    <p>"The riot lasted for about an hour, during which the police were absolutely
                        unable to restore order and confined themselves to res- cuing the endangered
                        Greeks-and marching them off to the caracol. The population of the quarter
                        has been greatly alarmed by these events, and several residents have
                        announced their intention of leaving the quarter."</p>
                    <p>We were informed by the Gouvernorat this morning that two Greeks and two
                        Arabs sustained injuries in the brawl which necessi- tated two days' medical

                    <p>From our Correspondent). Suez, Mondav. The Anchor Line steamer "Massilia,"
                        which arrived at Suez this morning from Bombay, reported that the British
                        steamer "Foyle," from Rangoon, was badly ashore in the Red Sea south of
                        Hanish island, near Gebel Zuhur. As I stated in my telegram this morning, I
                        understand that this steamer has a full cargo of rice for Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The "Foyle" is apparently in a very bad position, and several native dhows
                        were sighted in the vicinity ; they are supposed to be pirates. A British
                        cruiser was proceeding at the time towards the wreck to render
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>The other rice steamer "Helen Rickmers," is still fast near Ras Garib, viz.,

                    <p>The affairs of the above company seem again to be causing quite a ferment in
                        some native circles in Cairo in consequence of the non-fulfilment of their
                        duties by the two liquidators appointed last October as well as the action
                        taken lately by some former shareholders in instituting proceedings before
                        the Mixed Tribunals for the recovery of the money paid for shares, on the
                        ground that the shares were sold through wilful misrepresentation on the
                        part of the former board of directors. Besides the shareholders there are
                        innumerable creditor clamouring for settlement of their accounts who for
                        some time after the company stopped payment were kept quiet with the promise
                        that the late Menshawi Pasha would liquidate all outstanding debts and take
                        over the whole concern to work himself. These promises not being fulfilled,

                        allow this part of the road to remain entirely free for vehicular traffic,

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN BOOM.</head>
                    <p>The correspondent of a London contemporary remarks:-Egypt is being inundated
                        with new companies, and still more are to be floated. There are no less than
                        seven new concerns to be promoted before the autumn, and then the end will
                        not have been reached. The state of affairs is, indeed, one to give cause
                        for anxiety. Egypt is undoubtedly in a period of unprecedented prosperity,
                        but that does not warrant the indiscriminate launching of fresh companies.
                        As years go on there will be room for more syndicates, but at the present
                        moment the market is glutted, and will be so for some time to come if the
                        promoters do not give the present companies a chance to establish
                        themselves. The majority of them have no definite object in view-in fact,
                        they will deal in anything so long as there is a profit to be made out of
                        it. Most laudable object, no doubt, but as there are so many of them bent on
                        the same point it is difficult to foresee a successful future for them at
                        present.</p>

                    <head>SUPPLY FROM ARTESIAN WELLS.</head>
                    <p>The Cairo Water Company is now supplying water to the principal districts
                        from seven artesian wells, fire of which are worked from engines at
                        Rod-el-Farag and two from the Bonlae engines. The districts so supplied are
                        Shoubra, Boulac, Fagallah, Esbekieh, Ismailia, and Kasr-el-Aiui, whilst the
                        Abbassieh, Gamalieh, Darb-el-Abmar, Khalifa, and Saida Zenab districts still
                        receive their water supply through the Abbassieh filters.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bitter is occupied in making an analysis of the water which comes from
                        the artesian wells, so that at present we cannot give any information as to
                        the quality of the water and its purity, but we will publish the results of
                        Dr. Bitter's investigation as soon as they are completed. As regards the
                        quantity of the water, 65,000 cubic metres are being daily pumped through
                        the Cairo mains, of which 25,000 cubic metres come from the seven artesian
                        wells in use and 40,000 cubic metres pass through the Abbassieh filters. Two
                        more wells at Rod-el-Farag are being prepared, and it is anticipated that
                        these will be completed in four months' time; and should the system prove to
                        be thoroughly satisfactory after two years' trial the number of wells will
                        be increased to sixteen.</p>
                    <p>The supply of water to Zeitoun cpmes from a special well in that locality,
                        but unfortunately it has proved very deficient as regards quantity, and the
                        Water Company has no hopes of improving the conditions for another two
                        months, by which time they will have another engine working and so double
                        the present supply. In laying the plant for the Zeitoun supply the company
                        estimated that it would not be necessary to exceed the amount supplied to
                        Assiout (2,500 cubio metres per day) and they accordingly constructed an
                        engine capable of pumping 3,000 cubic metres per day, and Zeitoun is now
                        receiving that quantify, the engine being kept working throughout the 24
                        hours. Meanwhile the remedy lies in the hands of the residents, and if they
                        refrain from using the large quantities which are at present being used for
                        watering the gardens, they will find that the supply is ample for domestic
                        purposes. It must be remembered that the sandy soil of Zeitonn will absorb
                        almost any quantity of water and it is evident that the amount so wasted is
                        considerable.</p>

                        <p>The caisson round the sunken S.S. "Congal" was completed by Sunday
                            morning. It is composed of 2-inch deal and pine planks and is shored
                            from side to side and to the deck with balks of heavy timber jointed at
                            the bleak edges and well caulked. At 10 a.m. yesterday the pumping was
                            started, divers being in attendance. Several times, however, work had to
                            be stopped to allow of alterations being made. All night pumping
                            continued, and this morning a large centrifugal pump was got to work
                            under the ship to wash away the mud which had formed along her side. At
                            about 11 a.m. the vessel suddenly lifted aft about a foot and steadily
                            from then on she lifted. She now is (8 p.m.) well up aft, but the bow
                            still remains touching the bottom. The dry-dock is ready to receive her
                            the moment her draft of water will allow, and it is expected that by
                            evening she will be ready to be put in the dock. The cost of raising the
                            vessel will amount to £1,400.</p>

                    <head>CAPTURE OF HASHISH.</head>
                    <p>Three or four days ago, a large haul of hashish was made by the coastguards
                        here. The smugglers were traced by their footprints in the sand some
                        considerable distance from the canal bank a little north of Ismailia and the
                        hashish, from 650 to 700 kilos, was discovered by the coastguards bidden in
                        a field. The smugglers have not been caught so far.</p>
