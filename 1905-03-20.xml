                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM.</head>
                    <p>The Government has decided not to heighten the <placeName>Assouan
                            Dam</placeName> in the meantime, and as a corollary, not to sell, or
                        grant in concession, any large blocks of free State lands. <persName>Sir
                            William Garstin</persName>, in fall accord with <persName>Sir Benjamin
                            Baker</persName>, has come to a momentous decision, and the Council of
                        Ministers has adopted the conclusions arrived at We are told that scholiasts
                        have evolved new theories to prove that a dam might be safe as regards
                        cracking horizontally, but nevertheless be liable to crack vertically. We
                        are also told that a good deal of protective work must be undertaken
                        down-stream of the sluices. The public have been told all they need know. It
                        is enough to justify the decision arrived at against heightening the dam
                        meantime. Sir <persName>William Willcocks</persName>' opinion, frankly
                        expressed, can be best described as calling it funk on the part of Sir
                        Benjamin Baker, and in so doing affords a singular instance of freedom from
                        restraints of office. Our excellent confrere the "Phare d'Alexandrie" says
                        people believe that the report of Sir Wm. Garstin conceals an able manoeuvre
                        to check speculation in land,to the encouragement of transport facilities.
                        Government need not employ deep-laid schemes to develop transport. If this
                        were their aim it could be achieved by | less jealous obstacle-raising to
                        the development of the Delta Light Railway, and by respecting possible and
                        past navigation channels for the smaller class of boats. The desire to check
                        land speculation is laudable, but a Government can do much harm by
                        interference with economic laws. The British financial world is casting
                        longing eyes on Egypt, and. will have the land as surely as jt took the
                            <placeName>Transvaal goldfields</placeName>. The prohibition of all
                        Large sales of Government land is too drastic. The result will be increased
                        theft of Mariout lands by fictitious Bedouin sales, and transactions on
                        doubtful title of inferior lands elsewhere at high prices. We are promised a
                        study, of storage schemes other than heightening the dam, and
                        contemporaneously with this study there might be study of reclamation
                        methods on small selected areas. Sir Will Wllcocks advocates small basin
                        reservoirs in the Delta, and there is no earthly reason why he should not be
                        allowed to make the experiment. Other people advocate the use to drainage
                        water for reclamation purposes, and are prepared to back their opinion by
                        costly experiment. Artesian water may yet be found in Egypt, and , every
                        encouragement should be given to those who will undertake such an expensive
                        risk as boring to great depths. There are a million and a half feddans of
                        waste land in Egypt, and Government have a sacred trust in seeing that it
                        does not fall into the hands of capitalists for the mere asking. That trust
                        is equally abused if the talent is tied up in a napkin. It is pusillanimous
                        to stop all advance in reclamation because theorists question formula; for
                        calculating masonry dams, and it is weak to say if Government grant anyone
                        laud for experiment others will expect the same treatment It is in the
                        interacts of Egypt that in anticipation of farther summer supplies of Nile
                        water, lull experiment should meantime be allowed of rival reclamation
                        systems. Then Government will have some data to go on when the time comes to
                        deal with the waste State lands. A Government so desirous to protect the
                        public should see that land is neither given away, nor sold at prices
                        disastrous to the investor. A great deal of the outcry about scanty summer
                        water would cease if the whole of Lower Egypt were not now being put under
                        summer crop. Restriction of rice cultivation, and a permanent decree
                        forbidding the sowing of maize till July 20, would instantly result iu the
                        present summer supply being ample. Gross abuses have crept into file use of
                        summer and should be peremptorily checked. It is a solution of the present
                        difficulty which we submit to Government as an alternative course preferable
                        to stopping all agricultural development in Egypt. </p>

                            Miss Delanoy and Mrs, Nolan</persName> also were greatly appreciated by
                        the audieuce. Mr. Trimeu, as the Major General, gave a very good performance
                        in deed. He was one of the few performers we have seen in amateur operetta
                        who knows how to move about the stage naturally. He was a little confused
                        once, when giving the encore verse of the Major-General's song, but really
                        the verse in question was a little difficult. <persName>Capt. Tucker,
                            R.E</persName>., gave a very good performance of the Sergeant of Police,
                        and the two encore verses which he sang were enthusiastically received. He
                        had quite got over any of the nervousness which he show ed in the last
                        performance. Of the others, <persName>Mr. Serle Peacock</persName>, as
                        Samuel, the <persName>Hod. C. James</persName>, as the Pirate King, and Mrs
                        Merton, as Ruth, played their parts with great spirit, but we did not quite
                        understand the change in <persName>Mrs. Merton's</persName> "make-up" in the
                        second act, which was hardly in accord ance with the spirit of the piece.
                        The chorus performed their part very creditably. To turn to the music,
                            <persName>Bimbaahi Franklin</persName> had considerable difficulty with
                        his orchestra, but succeeded in staving off disaster, which threatened in

                        recently employed as a governess in an English family resident at Ramleh,

                        (formerly known as Johnson House), Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>The story of the suicide is a sad one. Miss Blake fell ill a few years ago in
                        South Africa and was treated with cocaine injections. The drug healed her,
                        but left far worse consequences than any which the malady it cured could
                        have done. Cocaine appears to have entirely mastered her, and she became a
                        helpless victim to the habit. It is evident that while under the influence
                        of the effects of the drug she decided to make away with herself, and made
                        an injection strong enough to kill six men. </p>

                    <p>An interesting service took place on Friday afternoon, 17 th inst, when the
                        foundation-stone of the <placeName>"Ethel Pain Memorial
                            Hospital"</placeName> was laid in the Church Missionary Sooiety's
                        compound at Old Cairo. About 160 people were present, and, after partaking
                        of tea in the garden, assembled at the spot ohosen, at the south-west comer
                        of the new building. The Rt. Rev. the Bishop in Jerusalem and the East was
                        present, and, after robing, was preceded to the site by his chaplain, the
                        Rev. N. Odeh, Archdeacon Potter of Cyprus, Dean Butcher, and the.C.M.S.
                        clergy. The Bishop conducted the service according to a form which had been
                        specially prepared for the occasion, and several of the other olergy took
                        part </p>
                    <p>The actual oeremony of laying the stone was performed by Sir Algernon Coote,
                        Bart (President of the Hibernian C.M.8.), who used in the process a handsome
                        silver and ebony mallet and trowel which had been presented to him by the
                        architect, <persName>Mr. A.H. Skyuder, M.S. .C.F.</persName> In a short
                        speeoh <persName>Sir Algernoon</persName> expressed his pleasure at having
                        been asked to lay this stone, and his interest, as an Irishman, in finding
                        that the oeremony was to take place on St Patrick's Day. He then described
                        the lack of room in the present hospital, the large number of patients, both
                        paying and free, who are treated in it every year, and the circumstances
                        which led to the building of the new memorial wards. Less than two years
                        after her first arrival in Egypt Mrs. Pain had passed away, having laid down
                        her life in the work. Her husband, Dr. Maynard Pain, who had been in charge
                        of the <placeName>Prince Alfred Hospital</placeName> in Sydney until he
                        joined the C.M.S., is still a member of the society's staff in Old Cairo,
                        and it was from his friends in Australia and New Zealand that subscriptions
                        amounting to £4,800 had been received. No grant has been asked for from the
                        C.M.8. in London, but about £460 has been eeutin donations from England,
                        £127 by residents in Egypt and visitors at the hotels, while the members of
                        the mission have shown their own belief in the value of the work by
                        contributing £76. The money already subscribed is sufficient for ad the
                        building contemplated. </p>
                    <p>The hospital, when finished, will contain beds for about 35 women and
                        children, and the present hospital will then be reserved for men only. There
                        will also be an operating theatre with all the latest improvements, towards
                        which the sterilising apparatus and an operating table have been already
                        contributed. <placeName>Sir Algernon</placeName> concluded by saying that a
                        hospital of this sort was one of the best ways of letting our works testify
                        to the value of the faith which will be proclaimed within its walls. Shortly
                        before six o'clock the company dispersed, and, in response to a stfygestion
                        made during Sir Algernon's speeoh, contributed P.T.923 to a box placed for
                        that purpose at the gate. </p>

                            state of mental aberration, threw herself from a second-floor window in

                            killing herself instantly. The deceased, who had been suffering from
                            typhoid fever and pneumonia, asked the nurse in charge to awaken the
                            servant, and it was during her temporary absence for this purpose that
                            the terrible deed was committed. The body was removed to the mortuary at

                        <p>Contrary to the expectations expressed in my notes in your issue of
                            yesterday, the Baltic Fleet has not yet arrived here, nor is there any
                            further news of it,' but the general opinion held here is that both the
                            third squadron and the hospital ship "Kostroma," which passed through
                            the Dardanelles five days ago, have gone to Soda. The proximity of this
                            squadron is evidenced by the presence in our town of the chief Russian
                            secret agent, who arrived from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> at 3.30 p.m.

                        <p>The British steamer "Planet Venus," which grounded in the Suez roads last
                            Wednesday morning, was refloated yesterday evening with the assistance

                        of which will be found in an advertisement in another column. </p>
                    <p>We have received a copy of the directors' report to be submitted to the
                        shareholders of the company at their first annual general meeting to be held
                        in <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to-morrow. This shows that substantial
                        progress has been made towards the reclamation of the company's lands; 830
                        feddans were levelled by cattle up to the 31st December last in spite of
                        cattle plague and consequent difficulty in obtaining cattle. The difficulty
                        is being got over by the purchase of a pair of Messrs. McLaren's 20 h.p.
                        ploughing machines; more of these powerful engines are to be employed if the
                        working results of the first pair justify it The directors report that the
                        result of last year's flood is very satisfactory, notwithstanding the poor
                        Nile flood with which the Wardan Company, in common with the rest of Egypt,
                        had to put up with. Tree planting has successfully passed the experimental
                        stage. Sufficient trees to plant 360 feddans are ready in pots to be planted
                        out this year. Twenty-seven miles of flood canal, representing more than a
                        million oubio metres of excavation, has been completed and has been provided
                        with regulators and sluices. The directors having satisfied themselves by
                        practical experiment that the system, adopted on the recommendation of Sir
                        William Willoooks, K. C. M. G., for reclaiming these lands is sound and
                        practicable, are now calling up the remainder of the unissued share capital,
                        and have engaged the necessary engineering staff so as to complete the work
                        in the conrae of the next three years. Like all land reclamation
                        undertakings, time is required before dividends can be paid, but we have
                        little doubt that the shareholders of the Wardan Company who can wait a year
                        or two longer will reap a handsome reward. </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,The official explanation given in the "Gazette" of Saturday in regard
                            to the strictures of the International Chamber of Shipping on the could
                            not of the Ports and Lighthouses Administration in the case of the
                            foundering of the Florio-Rubattido SB. "Cairo," does not dear up all the
                            difficulties to the responsibility for the disaster. In the first pis,
                            it is said that the captain of the steamer same within the pivot buoy,
                            and, being an experienced hand at entering the port of Alexandria, he
                            without a pilot on hoard should have either steamed up to the quarantine
                            anchorage or else let go his anchor in the neighbourhood of the pivot
                            buoy. He would then no doufithavejot a pilot within hslf-an-hour or/
                            say, an hour. Failing that it should have waited until daylight Had he
                            wished to remain outside the harbour, he could have anchored anywhere
                            within half-a-mile of the Bough Pass, by keeping his leading lights in
                            one and steering in that course. The book of Admiralty directions to the
                            port of Alexandria is quite dear to any stranger who approaches the port
                            at night and that coupled with the most excellent leading lights' and
                            the breakwater fight should have enabled the captain or even a stranger
                            to enter the port without a pilot with the greatest of ease. How the
                            ship managed to fetch up ou the Agame shoal, when the leading fights can
                            be seen on a dark night with a dear atmosphere for seven or eight miles,
                            it is difficult for any navigator to understand. The pilot boats are in
                            the habit of lying on a calm night either at the Tiviot wreck bnoy or
                            else lying well outside in deep water, quite dear of the Agame shoal.
                            There is therefore no excuse for any navigator entering the port of
                            Alexandria at night to mistake probably a fidring boat off the Agame
                            shoal for a pilot boat </p>
                        <p>Another point I should like to point out is that as the Ports and
                            Lighthouses Administration's powerful.tug "Teir el-Mina" is not fitted
                            with water-tube boilers, it is impossible to raise steam within six
                            hoars unless a great deal of barm be done to the boilers. If the
                            Administration had had any other tog-boats available no doubt assistance
                            would have been sent at onoe. But taking into consideration the state of
                            the sea and swell, it was impossible for any boat, tug-boat or
                            otherwise, to get dose up to the "Cairo" until the morning. </p>
                        <p>In my humble opinion the official who is responsible for the port of
                            Alexandria and the interests thereof is the Captain of the Port I have
                            been informed that this official, on hearing the pews, ordered steam at
                            once to be got up on the "Tdr-d-Mina," but owing to the state of the
                            weather found that it was impossible to get alongside. However, the next
                            morning the "Teir el Mina," towing three boats, went out to the soene of
                            the wreck in order to save both passengers and mails, and, if necessary,
                            the baggage. The "Cairo" had a list ot 45 degrees to starboard and it
                            was therefore impossible to save any baggage. One mail-room, on being
                            opened, was found to have had its contents all washed away. </p>
                        <p>1 have read a great many allegations in some of the local French papers
                            on the subject of the dangers of the port of Alexandria apropos of the
                            wreck of the "Cairo." In my opinion as an experienced navigator of this
                            port, and of many other ports also, Alexandria is one of the best-lit
                            ports in the whole of the Mediterranean, and therefore there ought to be
                            no excuse for any man responsible for the navigation of a ship to
                            deviate from his oourse except in oaae of fog. Even in the latter case
                            there is very little margin for exouse when the hand lead can be used
                            within seven mil of the ooast between Marsa Matrouh and PortBaid. I may
                            conolude the- few remarks by., expressing a wish that in future
                            navigators, when entering the port of Alexandria by night or by day,
                            will read, mark, learn,and inwardly digest the book of Admiralty
                            directions, which every efficient navigator ought to have, and of
                            oourse, at the same time, pay careful attention to the chart If this
                            advice be followed, there oan be no possible difficulty in entering the
                            port of Alexandria or any other portI am, eto, </p>

                        well known in Egypt where he served for a considerable time. He was with the
                        Camerons at the routing of Arabi from Tel-el-Kebir's trenches, the Nile
                        Expepedition 1884-5, and he commanded the Cameron detachment of the Camel

                        Khedivial forces. The report of the Director of the Recruiting and
                        Organisation for 1904, just published, shows that the number of recruits who
                        joined the regular army exclusive of Colonial Corps was 41,279, and the
                        Militia recruits 35,624. pi the latter, 15,648 joined the regular army and

                        that the regulation requiring a character on enlistment has materially
                        raised the tone of the army and popularised it amongst the better class of

                    <p>Uncle Sam's short ride has also proved a dead failurelike our own. It was to

                        has not been lost on the Washington officials, who are now devising a longer

                        four years' service to be transferred to it on payment of the proportion of
                        their discharge money. Men of eight years' service can transfer free. The
                        Royal Marines are included in this but stokers and higher ratings are
                        excluded. The order will remain in force during the financial year of
                        1905-6, at the end of which it will be reported upon. </p>

                    <head>UM RUS Gold Mines</head>
                    <p>The directors of the Um Kus Gold Mines of Egypt propose to issue 30,000 new
                        shares to $1 each, thereby raising the capital of the company to £ 180,000,
                        and in a circular which has been sent out conveuiug the necessary meeting
                        for the consideration of the resolution they express the opinion that the
                        scale of operations should be extended, with the ultimate object of
                        increasing the number of stamps and erecting a cyanide plant for the
                        recovery of the gold from the tailings. These shares will be offered at par
                        in the first instance to the existing shareholders at the rate of one new
                        share for every five shares held, payable as follows :5s. per share on
                        application, 5s. per share on allotment, and the balance in calls not
                        exceeding 5s. per share allotment of not less than three months. The
                        directors hope that each- shareholder will avail himself of this opportunity
                        of increasing his holding in the company. </p>
                    <p>The proposal to increase the capital has been sanctioned by the Egyptian
                        Government. The light railway from the harbour of Imbarak to the mine, about
                        five and a-half miles in length, has been completed, and a locomotive
                        installed carriage of machinery and stores to the mine is much facilitated
                        thereby. The company owns a steamer, which brings machinery and goods from
                        Suez to Imbarak. By this means shipments from England are made expeditiously
                        and economically. To facilitate the landing of goods a* substantial jetty,
                        157 ft. long, has been constructed. A crane has been fixed thereon, and
                        goods are lifted out of the lighters direct into the railway trucks. At the
                        harbour the electrical power station is practically complete. Two 150-k.w.
                        generators have been installed, and power will be transmitter! Then mine to
                        drive the air compressor, hauling gear, and other plant The mill has been
                        erected at a convenient site close to the power station, and necessary
                        boilers to supply the steam required to drive the electrical machinery and
                        mill engine are completed. The air compressor has been designed to work ten
                        rock drills, with the object of opening up the reef with greater rapidity.
                        It is estimated that there are about 9,000 tons of ore already in reserve.'
                        For the purpose of considering the proposals an extraordinary general
                        meeting has been convened at the Cannon Street Hotel to-day. The "St James's
                        Gazette" remarks : We do not see any reason why the proprietors should rush
                        to take advantage of the ' occasion. The directors are of opinion that the
                        Beale of operations should be extended by an increase in the number of
                        stamps and the erection of a cyanide plant. But there seems no immediate
                        hurry for this, since there are only about 9,000 tons of ore in reserve, or
                        about enough to keep the present stamps going for nine months. </p>
