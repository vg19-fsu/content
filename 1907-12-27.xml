                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.

                    <head>THE OXYRHYNCHUS FINDS.</head>
                    <p>No discoveries in the literature of antiquity have an interest so intimate
                        and so wide as those which throw new light upon the person and the work of
                        Christ. Two years ago in the mounds of Oxyrhynchus in the Fayoum, which have
                        already yielded as the "Logia," the "Sayings," of Jesus, there was found a
                        single small vellum leaf, somewhat torn at the corpers, on which a scribe
                        had contrived to write some forty-five lines. They proved to be an account
                        of conversations between Christ and His disciples and Christ and a certain
                        chief priest, of which we have no other record. The script is apparently of
                        the fourth century. This fragment of a new gospel has now been made
                        socessible in an excellent edition prepared by Dr. Grenfell and Dr Hunt. It
                        opens in the middle of a sentence which is part of a speech of Jesus to His
                        disciples, affirming that the penalty of sin is not complete here, but that
                        "the evildoers among men await punishment and much torment" hereafter. The
                        word translated "torment" is "basanoss," which has elsewhere been emphasised
                        by ingenious people anxious to explain the traditional torment of hell as a
                        testing or a trial. From this the fragment proceeds to conversation between
                        Jesus and "a certain Pharisee, a chief priest," whose name is not certainly
                        legible concerning the value of ceremonial purity. The chief priest
                        complains that Christ has looked on the holy vessels unwashed and defiled,
                        has walked in the temple "which is a pure place." He proceeds to give a
                        curious description of his own ablutions: "For I washed in the pool of
                        David, and having descended by one staircase I ascended by ano ther," and so
                        on. There comes a vebement and somewhat rhetorical reply. "Thou hast washed
                        in these running waters wherein dogs and swine have been cast night and day,
                        and bast cleansed and wiped the outside skin. ... Bat I and my disciples,
                        who, thou sayest bave not batbed have been bathed in the waters of
                        everlasting life...." Then with the words, "But woe unto thee ..." the
                        fragment breaks off. It will be obvious that the episode has its parallels
                        in the canonical gospels, and that its spirit is entirely in scoord with all
                        that we know of Christ's teaching. The fact that Christ is throughout
                        referred to only as "Soter," "Saviour," after the manner of the Gpostios, is
                        the only ground for imputing anything onorthodox But to accept the narrative
                        as a plain record of fact is difficult. There is no reason to believe that a
                        Jew had to wash and change his clothes when visiting the temple. It is
                        almost impossible to believe that a chief priest would bathe in a pool into
                        which dead dogs and swine were cast. The "Pool of David" is unknown to us
                        from any other writing, and the two stairways, one for the dirty and one for
                        the clean, have all the air of things of the imagination. All this, however,
                        is not to say that the fragment is entirely unhistorical. It seems to us
                        plainly an instance of the literary elaboration of a tradition. Some
                        writer--and a writer of skill, for he uses an attractive style and a number
                        of unworn words-bas worked over old stories. His date was probably in the
                        latter half of the second century, and his dwelling. place Egypt No
                        competent judge is likely to dispute the conclusion of Dr. Grenfell and Dr.
                        Hunt that "the fragment is an interesting and valuable addition to the
                        scanty remnant of the numerous uncanonical traditions concerning Christ's
                        teaching which were current in many Christian communities, especially in
                        Egypt, during the third and fourth centurion."</p>

                        traditional turkeys, roast beef and plum. pudding, the blind boys prolonged
                        their festive meeting around their bright and jovial tables for a good part
                        of the afternoon, partaking of the variety of fruit, with which their table,
                        were loaded, indulging in merry chat and occasional songs, and thus
                        forgetting tbeir dismal lot. The parental solicitude of Mr. and Mrs. Tongs
                        for the welfare and all possible happiness of the unfortunate blind boys is
                        worthy of all praise. But this highly useful and philanthropic establishment
                        does not unfortunately seem to be es well-known as it ought to be to the
                        people of Alexandria, and especially to the wealthy, who would be sure to
                        come forward and give it that material support which it so much needs and so
                        well deserves, if its obvious usefulness or even its existence were to come
                        to their knowledge, The Industrial School for the Blind has for its object,
                        primarily, to teach the boys an industry, and as such basket and
                        chair-making has been cbosen, which is the case in similar institutions in
                        other countries, and in the second place, to teach the blind boys reading
                        and writing according to the Braille system. Owing to the assiduous devotion
                        of Mr. and Mrs. Tongs considerable progress has been made, within a few
                        months, in both these objects. But in spite of the usefulness of the
                        institution, its means are so limited, that its beneficial intluence is very
                        limited, confined of necessity to only a few blind boys. Were its means
                        ampler, a larger number of blind boys would be accomodated within its philan
                        thropic walls, and thus a greater number of sadly suffering tellow creatures
                        would have been taught a useful industry whereby to earn their livilihood,
                        and would have been made happier We many add that this institution was
                        projected by Lady Meath, who greatly helped in its crention and contributes
                        to its maintenance </p>

                            was attended by Prince Mohamed Aly Halim Pasha. Sheikh Aly Youssef made
                            a speech on the objects of the new Party. He alluded most
                            sympathetically to the loss Egypt had sustained by the death of the
                            leader of the Party of the People. Mohamed Bey Said and Hafez Effendi
                            Awad afterwards delivered some speeches and the meeting closed. The
                            speech of Sheikh Aly Youssef occupies columns and columns of yesterday's
                            issue of "Al Moayad." He declared that the object of the new Party was
                            not to oppose, but to show the Government the needs of the people of
                            Egypt. As to the British Occupation he said the Party would trust to its
                            promises as to the eventual evacuation of the country and his arguments
                            and quotations from English statesmen's speeches fill five columns of
                            print. Hafiz Effendi Awad declared that the new Party was the object of
                            the sympathy of many Radicals in the House of Commons, such as Mr.
                            Robertson, Dr. Rutherford, etc. He stated that Dr. Rutherford would be
                            in Egypt next month and that the Party would entertain him to a banquet.
                            Owing to the support the Party was receiving from people in England, it
                            would be the first among all the political parties in Egypt. It is
                            announced that some Coptic notables of Cairo have given their adherence

                            émaner de la Nation." Je dois me réjouir que l'appel que j'ai fait à la

                            Ganem the "raison d'être" of the party is the fear that, if the
                            occupation be brought to an end, the country will relapse into a
                            condition similar to what was the case in the Mamaluke era and that the
                            only solution is the education of the people in republican

                        which have not been built upon in conformity with the regulations will be
                        forfeited on the first of January if the Government insists upon the strict
                        execution of the regnlations. It is feared by those interested in building
                        and agricultural lands that if this should take place, the result will be a
                        complete paralysis of the land market, and it is hoped that the Government,
                        taking into con sideration the financial conditions which have prevailed for
                        several months, will extend the period during which building should be done
                        until the present crisis is tided over.</p>

                    <head>KHARTOUM AND CAIRO</head>
                    <p>A definite announcement has just recently been made on the scheme for the
                        establishment of a bridge over the Blue Nile at Khar tonm, incidentally
                        required in connection with south ward extensions of the Sudan Government
                        railway system, but primarily in con nection with Sir William Garstin's
                        project for the irrigation of the Gbezireh, the district lying between the
                        Blue and White Niles. The work at Khartoum which constitutes the most
                        valuable bridge contract ever placed for any part of the African continent,
                        will be carried out by the Cleveland Bridge and Enginneering Company
                        (Limited), of Darlington, the same firm who completed, in September 1905,
                        the railway bridge over the Victoria Falls of the Zambesi, an undertaking
                        which they carried tbrongh with an expedition pro voking well deserved
                        praise from those associated with that enterprise. For the con struction of

                    <head>MAPS OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>A few days ago we published a letter from a correspondent, signed "Mercator"
                        on the need for a general map of Egypt. Several of the questions asked by
                        our correspondent are readily answered, though, as he says, it may not
                        always be easy for the general public to arrive At them. This in effect was
                        the reason for proposing a Map Exhibition. The difficulty of publishing a
                        complete map of Egypt has been due to the fact that until there was a
                        reliable chain of triangulation tbrough the country, it was impossible to
                        co-ordinate the various maps any more successfully than had hitherto been
                        dore. The urgent necessity for reassessing the Land Tax demanded the
                        publication of Cadastral Mape first of all. The line of triangulation from
                        Wa'i Halfa to the sea was completed about tw years ago, but the reduction of
                        some 20,000 (audastral Maps, and the compilation of many hundreds of Desert
                        Surveys, requires a considerable time. Half of Egypt is already published on
                        the scale of 1:50,000 suitable for adminis' rative purposes. Maps of
                        1:250,000 and 1: 1,000,000 are now in band, so that the need for a general
                        map of the country will soon be met Specimens of all these maps will be on
                        view in the Map Exhibition which will be open to the public from the 9th to
                        the 18th of January at the Geological Museum in Cairo.</p>

                            the "Egypt" sailed for Luxor on her return trip yesterday she left
                            behind quite a number of her passengers. Mr. and Mrs. Adam Frost and Mr.
                            and Mrs. Bates left the ship for the Cataract Hotel where they stay till
                            the 30th and then proceed to Wady Halta. Dr. Alfred Lappenburg with bis
                            niece Miss Dorothea von Rosen from Copenhagen went to the Savoy as well
                            as Fran Dr. M. Mayes and Mr. J. N Finney and his party who all intend
                            staying a considerable time at Assouan. The "Egypt" was on show from 3
                            to 5 each day of her stay at Assouan and a great many visitors from the
                            hotels went over the new boat and had tea on board. The first dance of
                            the season took place at the Cataract Hotel on the 22nd Judge Dorn of
                            San Francisco with Mrs. Dorn and Miss Elisabeth Sullivan and Miss C.
                            Baldwin were among those of the "Egypt" passengers who were present as
                            also Mr Ruddock Jnr. and Miss N. M Ruddock. The Earl and Countess of
                            Rothes with their party consisting of Capt. A. H. Devenish and Lady
                            Mildred Leslie are expected at the Cataract Hotel ou December 28th and
                            will stop a few days on their way to the Sudan The Duke and Duchess of

                            and seem likely to prolong their stay. A gymkhana was arranged for
                            Christmas day in the grounds of the Cataract Hotel and there were many
                            entries of both ladies and gentlemen for the various events. Donkey polo

                        d'arrangement. Dans ces conditions on peut s'étonner du zèle que mettent les
                        agents à confectionner une cote qui n'a par le fait qu'une importance toute
                        relative, la plupart des cours étant forcément nominaux faute de
                        transactions. L'Agricole fléchit de 73 4 8 7 23 32 et la Ramleh de 4 3 16 à
                        41 8. La Delta Light s'ins. crit à 9 1/2 ex-coupon. Quant à l'Obligation
                        ancienne Crédit Foncier, elle s'écroule de 274 å 271 1/2. On a beau dire
                        qu'il s'agit simplement de ventes forcées d'on titre facilement négociable,
                        certains détenteurs commencent à s'in quiéter de cette dégringolade
                        ininterrompue, surtout que les Lots Turcs à peu près dans la même situation
                        gagnent du terrain et s'avancent aujourd'hui de 163 à 165. En baisse
                        également la Land Bank de 7 1 8 à 71/16, l'Urbaine de 2 7/8 à 2 13 16, le
                        Comptoir de 2 1/8 à 2, et l'action Allotment de 2 à 1 15/16 La Banque
                        d'Athènes reprend, au contraire, de 112 à 112 1/4 et la Banque d'Orient de
                        111 1/2 à 112 Les Ritz Hotels dont nous avons parlé pro gressent de 1/4 à
                        3/8, prix auquel il s'est traité plusieurs milliers. "Il n'y a pas de
                        changement à signaler sur le reste de la cote. Ceux que nous venons de
                        mentionner n'ont d'ailleurs que pen de signi fication étant pour la plupart

                    <p>The following letter, signed by the Bishop of Durham, Mr. T.F. Victor Buxton,
                        Mr. J.B. Braddon, and Mr. T. W. H. Inskip has been pent to the Press :</p>
                    <p>"It will be within the recollection of many of your readers that at the
                        beginning of September last the Church of England lost one of the ablest of
                        her younger missionaries by the death of the Rev. D. M. Thornton, of the
                        Church Missionary Society's mission in Cairo. It is strongly felt by us and
                        others of his friends that so remarkable a personality as his, conspicuous
                        as it was for unconquerable energy and untiring devotiou, should not be lett
                        without some permanent memorial in the land to which he gave his lite. We
                        bave accordingly decided to open a Douglas Thornton Memorial Fund to be
                        placed in the bands of trustees for the furtberance of his plans for the
                        extension of Christ's kingdom in Egypt. One of his greatest ambitions, to
                        the attainment of which he himself contributed in no small measure, was the
                        circulation in Egypt of wholesome Christian literature, chiefly in Arabic.
                        We have reason to know that the insufficiency of funds to carry out his
                        plans in this direction was a constant burden to him, and that projects of
                        great importance and usefulness were thus frequently hampered. He was always
                        a profound believer in the power of the printed page to advance Christ's
                        kingdom among men. We are assured by those who know that no scheme would be
                        of greater assistance to the mission than this, or more immediately fruitful
                        in strengthening the cause which he loved. Nor would it be easy to name one
                        which would do more to keep his memory alive, for every book or pamphlet
                        would bear his name. If sufficient funds are available we might turn our
                        attention to some of the other projects which Mr. Thornton had so much at
                        heart. We therefore confidently appeal to all his friends and to all who
                        profited by his word and example to give us their warm support. The fund
                        will be administered by a committee consisting of the following : --The
                        Bishop of Durham, the Maxter of Trinity, Archdeacon Pelham, Rev. R. Melones

                        Monday caused considerable displacements of cash, and the result of this
                        movement was to create a better enquiry for short loans at rates ranging
                        fron 4 to 5 per cent. When it became known later on in the same day that New
                        York had bought nearly all the bar gold in the market (about £500,000)the
                        demand for loans increased still further, and three months bills were quoted
                        at 54 per cent. The Bank rate remains at 7 per cent, although it was
                        suggested earlier in the week that it might be lowered, but the present rate
                        has been maintained as a protective measure against Germany, a monetary
                        stringency being expected in Berlin at tbe end of the year, and it is
                        thought that the Reicbsbank will have to raise its rate. The Bank return for
                        the week ending December 18th shows that considerable inroads were made on
                        the Bank reserve by the bomo demand for currency. The withdrawal of gold
                        however was off set by the release of sovereigns by the India Council, but
                        £1,213,000 in coin and £188,000 notes were taken into circulation and the
                        reserve bas declined by £1,275,000, while the percentage to liabilities is 1
                        per cent lower The comparison with last year shows the Bank reserve to be
                        to-day £22,399,000 as against £19,712,000 and the proportion of cash to
                        liabilities 45.90 per cent as against 887 per cent last year. The
                        application for the £2,500,000 of Treasury Bills at six months reached a
                        total £5,803,000. Tenders at £98 received about 97 per cent of the amount
                        applied for. The average rate of discount being, 83, 198 110.97 as against

                        This should therefore prove satisfactory to the Government in view of the
                        fact that the Bank rate at the time of the earlier issue viz 23 September
                        last was only 5 per cent., as compared with 7 per cent. now </p>

                        operations caused a sbarp rally and the price was marked up to 25 tad per

                        however not many purchasers at the higher figure and prices do not appear to

                        to ratify the working agreement are to take place to day, and in view of
                        this some support has been given to the issues of these Companies. Some
                        dealings have taken place in Brighton "A" on the strength of rumours being
                        circulated that the dividend is to be increased. It is guardedly stated that
                        certain economies have been effected which will enable a declaration of
                        nearer 4 per cent to be made than 3 per cent. The traffic returns of nearly
                        all lines show increases, which in view of the disorganization of freights
                        by the gale last week, are satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Americans</p>
                    <p>Support was given to the American market which experienced quite a small
                        boom. The report of the failure of two American Banks one in Pittsburg and
                        ope in Massachusetts, instead of depressing the market, had a salutary
                        effect and business showed an increase. Another factor which made for
                        strength was the declaration of several of the railroad divi. dends,
                        Readings being helped by the announce ment of the regular semi-annual
                        dividend of 2 per cent. New York Central announced the usual quarterly
                        dividend, but owing to the poor statement concerning the year's earnings the
                        distribution failed to influence the stook. On Thursday Union Pacifics came
                        in for a good deal of support and advanced from the opening fig' re of 119

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir,- Ooly a short time ago I bad occasion to write to you with reference
                            to the stale new, which filled one part of a native paper, and the vapid
                            articles which took up the front page ; you were so good as to publish
                            my letter and this encourages me to again call your atten tion, and I
                            hope that of your readers, to a question of wider interest which also
                            refers to the native press of this country, and more particularly to
                            those papers published in Arabic and consequently addressed especially
                            to tbe native Egyptians. This press has been accorded an almost
                            exuberant liberty, which might well be the envy of most European
                            editors; and I suppose this has been done for some good purpose. I
                            imagine that a paternal Government thought it migbt be the means of
                            educating the masses of the population, but so far as I am able to
                            judge, it bas not done much in this way. It is true that the Arabic
                            papers are always crying out for more schools, but has it never occurred
                            to them, that there is in this country a vast number of people too old
                            to go to school, and yet who's ignorance on every question, except those
                            connected with the routine of their daily life, is profound. I will
                            refer to one question only and that is an essential one, – the
                            contemporary history of their own country say tor the last forty years.
                            It is most extraordinary how ignorant the average Egyptian is on this
                            subject. I should like to see an elementary catechism prepared with
                            reference to it, by tbe Ministry of Education, and no one should be
                            allowed to take any part in politics or to do anything outside a
                            handicraft, unless he could fairly well answer its questions Surely this
                            is a matter that the native press should have taken up, and by not doing
                            so they should incur the same blame as that awarded to the Scribes and
                            Pharisees of this and neighbouring countries some 2000 years ago. I very
                            much doubt if the great Mostata Pasba Kamel himself could pass the
                            simple test I have suggested, with much credit, and I feel convinced
                            that most of the members of the I.egislative Council could not do so;
                            otherwise it would never have been recorded of them, as it was in your
                            columns quite recently, that one of their tpost important decisions was
                            to criticise the Egyptian Government with reference to their expenses in
                            connection with the Sudan. Have these gentlemen no memory, can they not
                            even remember the state of this country hardly twenty years ago ? If not
                            let them read up the history of those times ; it is written in every
                            language, except perhaps in Arabic, or if history is too long for them
                            let them read the short epic poem written by Rudyard Kipling about that
                            time, beginning with the lines, "Says England upto Pharoah, I will make
                            &amp; man of you, That can stand upon his feet and play the game." This
                            poem refers to the training of the Egyptian Army after it disastrous
                            defeat under Hicks Pasha at El Obeid ; and its two most important lines
                            are "There were years they do not talk of, There were times of horrid
                            doubt." These two lines mean volumes to those who know how to interpret
                            them in the light of the state of this country at the time to which they
                            refer; - they mean that above Wady Halfa there was a savage horde, wbo
                            but for the restraint of a thin red line, bad both the wish and the
                            power to murder or drive into the sea, the whole population of Lower
                            Egypt The most extraordinary circumstance in this connection was the
                            ignorance of the inhabitants, of the critical situation in which they
                            were placed, but it was a time which will never be forgotten by those
                            who had a clearer insight While these things were going on, the present
                            Members of the Legislative Council were being brought up like chicks in
                            wool, in a state of ignorance from which they seem never to have
                            emerged. The native press may do some good if it would bring these
                            things to their knowledge, but it would bave to be done with painfal
                            iteration, and if these gentlemen ever get so far as to know a little of
                            the history of their country, they may also be told that bistory otten
                            has an uncomfortable way of repeating itself. Atter due reflection on
                            such subjects they might be inclined to think differently of the wisdom
                            of incurring certain expenses in con nection with the Sudan. </p>
