                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 25.</p>
                        <p>Bight thousand railway men have met here and decided on a general strike
                            to-day on all the railways serving St. Petersburg. The men of the
                            Vistula railroads struck at midnight. The railway strike at Moscow is
                            spreading in every direction, involving a dozen of the prin cipal
                            towns.</p>
                        <p>The railway men have sent a deputation to M. Witte, declaring that the
                            only remedy for the present situation is political liberty, and the
                            convocation of a National Assembly elected by direct universal suffrage.
                            Enough blood has already been shed in Manchuris and in the cities of
                            Russia. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>LODZ, October 25.</p>
                        <p>Thirty thousand workmen in the factories struck yesterday. The strike is
                            political in character. The proclamation of martial law is imminent.

                        <p>Moscow, October 25. The Congress of Social Democrats has de cided to form
                            local clubs and committees. throughout the Empire for the purpose of
                            taking united action. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 25. The city is completely cut off, except by
                            telegraph. Sir C. Hardinge has been unable to leave. The gravity of the
                            situation is hourly asserting itself. The whole state of the municipal
                            organisations is dislocated by ramifications of the strike movement,
                            which, it is believed, owes its origin, to à great extent, to the
                            intensity of the discontent at the inadequacy of the proposed
                            reforms.</p>
                        <p>M. Witte, replying to the deputation of railway employés, admitted the
                            justice of some of their demands, while others were absolutely
                            unrealisable; such, for example, as that of universal suffrage, which is
                            inspired by outside influences. He promised the liberty of the press and
                            meeting. The deputation was disappointed. A meeting of the railway
                            employés and students was subsequently held at the University.
                            Revolutionary speeches were delivered.</p>
                        <p>Rioting and looting are reported from Riga. There are many killed and
                            wounded. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 25. The hands at the Patiloff and other great
                            works have struck.</p>
                        <p>The troops at Ekaterinoslav fired a volley into an assemblage of railway
                            employés to-day, and also into a political demonstration. There are a
                            number of killed and wounded. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 25. All railway communication has been cut off.
                            Several factories have gone on strike. Food is becoming dear. The
                            circulation of trains has also stopped at Warsaw.</p>

                        <p>Reuter's Agency learns that the next step in the financial control of

                            be received by the Sultan. The adoption of coercive measures largely
                            depends on the result of this audience. It is not true that Germany is
                            not acting in accord with the other Powers, though whether all would
                            participate in an eventual naval demonstration is immaterial, as their
                            unity is undoubted. The Russian Black Sea fleet has sailed from Odessa
                            for the Anatolian coast to-day. It is believed that this is in
                            connection with such a demonstration. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>The statement published in the home Press to the effect that the
                            negotiations between Russia and Germany have resulted in a rapprochement
                            is untrue; but it is quite correct that the negotiations now in progress
                            both in London and St. Petersburg are about to assume definite shape.
                            Sir Charles Hardinge's return to London and Count de Benckendorff's
                            return to St. Petersburg are connected with the pourparlers which are
                            necessary before a complete understanding can be reached, and which it
                            is probable will have as its object an entente on the maintenance of the
                            status quo and the development of commercial interests in Asia, together
                            with the resumption by Russia of ber former role as a European

                        <p>LONDON, October 25. The "Times" learns from St. Petersburg that the visit
                            of Sir C. Hardinge to London is believed to be connected with
                            pourparlers for an Anglo-Russian rapprochement.</p>

                    <p>The station was crowded at an early hour by holders of special invitations to
                        witness the departure of his Highness for Cairo. Among those present were

                        European notables.</p>
                    <p>The streets had been decorated and were thronged with sightseers, and a
                        strong contingent of boy musicians from the Moslem charitable schools was
                        drawn up in Cherif Pasha-street. They played the Khedivial hymn and uttered
                        the Turkish salate of "Efendimiz chok yashs," as the Khedive drove up to the
                        station in the company of H.H. Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan, escorted by

                        a detachment of the Royal Dablin Fusiliers, presented arms, and the bands
                        played the Khedivial talute..</p>

                        the Khedive entered the train, followed by the Ministers and his s tite, and
                        at 7.30 a.m, the thunder of guns from Fort Kom el Dik proclaimed the news of
                        the Khedive's departure for the Capital.</p>
                    <p>ARRIVAL AT CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>Long before H. H. the Khedive's train was due to arrive in Cairo, small knots
                        of people began to collect in and around the Bab el Hadeed Station, and at a
                        quarter-past eleven the crowd was considerable; but the approaches were kept
                        clear by mounted and foot police for those who had been honored with an
                        invitation to meet his Highness on the arrival platform.</p>
                    <p>The station presented a very gay spectacle with its abundant display of the
                        Ottoman flag and decorated shields, and the route along which his Highness
                        passed as he drove to Abdeen Palace was plentifu decorated in a similar

                        battalion colour and the Cavalry Band, was drawn up inside the station,
                        while outside the station, in front of the main exit, the Army of Occupation
                        provided a guard of honor, composed of one captain, three subalterns,, and
                        100 rank and file of the 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, with
                        the battalion colour and band. Punctually at half-past eleven the Khedivial
                        train entered Cairo station and drew up at platform No. 2. Major L'Estrange
                        Johnston, Capt. Blakeney, Mr. Bain, M. Barois, and Mr. Crossby ac companied

                    <p>As his Highness stepped from the carriage the colour of the 3rd Battalion was
                        dipped in salute and the Cavalry Band played the Khedivial anthem, while a
                        salute of 21 guns was fired from the open space between Pont Limoun and Bab
                        el Hadeed stations.</p>
                    <p>Shaking hands with all those who had come to meet him, the Khedive gradually
                        made his way to the main exit, and as he descended the steps he was saluted
                        by the guard of honor of the 2nd R. Inniskilling Fusiliers and the playing
                        of the Khedivial anthem by the battalion band, after which his Highnees
                        stepped into his carriage and, preceded by his Body Guard, drove through the

                    <p>AND THE</p>
                    <p>THE NEXT-OF-KIN OF THE KHEDIVE ISMAIL EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT.</p>
                    <p>The following letter appears in the "Times" of the 18th inst.:-</p>
                    <p>Sir, I have read your notice of this matter in your issue of to-day, and ask
                        you to permit me to make a comment on it on behalf of my clients, the
                        next-of-kin.</p>
                    <p>The claimants do not "invoke such precedents as the seigneurial rights over
                        landed property in Barope during the Middle Ages by virtue of conquest" in
                        support of their claim, but to rebut Lord Cromer's assertion that the Daira
                        Sanieh properties were first acquired by the Khedive Ismail in an illegal
                        manner, considering as they do that this assertion is ant aspersion upon
                        their late father's memory.</p>
                    <p>The point is, after all, a side issue, but it has this importance, that if
                        the title of the Khedivial family be impugned the Egyptian Government, who
                        can only derive their title through the Khedivial family (since confisca
                        tions are prohibited in the Ottoman Empire since the Hatti Cherif of Gall
                        Hane (1839), confirmed by the Hatt Houmayoun of 1856, and extented to Egypt
                        by the Firman of 1867 constituting the Egyptian Viceroyalty), impugn their
                        own title.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact the Daira Sanieh properties, for the most part, descended
                        to Ismail Pasha, as the grandson of Mehemet Ali, the conqueror of Egypt,
                        before he became Viceroy, and neither the High Commission of Inquiry nor the
                        Liquidation Commission (of both of which Lord Cromer was a member) ever made
                        any inquiry into the first acquisition of the Daira Sanieh properties.</p>
                    <p>The real point at issue is that if the Egyptian Government have any title at
                        all they must have derived it through Ismail Pashs, and that if there ever
                        was any transfer or even any promise to transfer by him it was for a
                        specific purpose only-namely, that the deficit which then existed might be
                        wiped out.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting in this particular to give Lord Cromer's words uttered at
                        the sitting of the High Commission of Inquiry of August 7, 1878, in extenso.
                        They are as follows:- "Mr. Baring thought that the Commission should decide
                        as follows:-</p>
                    <p>1. The amount of the deficit is such a sum. 2. The Khedive is personally
                        responsible for the present situation.</p>
                    <p>3. He has lands acquired in an irregular</p>
                    <p>manner.</p>
                    <p>4. He should restore them to the State to an amount anfficient to meet the
                        deficit."</p>
                    <p>The next-of-kin claim that, the deficit having been met, the surplus should
                        revert to them. May I, in conclusion, point out that the opinion expressed
                        by the legal adviser your correspondent speaks of (really the Legal
                        Department of the Egyptian Government) is not shared by the advisers to the
                        next-of-kin? They take a diametrically opposite view, and including, as they
                        do, the late M. Waldeck- Rousseau, M. Poincaré,and others, their opinion is
                        equally entitled to weight..</p>
                    <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                        agreement with England. French statesmen had promised to support. Egypt but
                        they had cancelled their valuable promises of support, and in consequence
                        France had lost her influence in Egypt. The Anglo- French agreement, in
                        which English statesmanship shone, was a warning to the whole Orient not to
                        trust in France. France had no friendly intentions towards two great
                        Mohamedan nations, Egypt and Morocco; but Morocco, which had long been
                        independent, would not be easily subdued., Even if the Sultan of Morocco
                        were to submit to French in flaence-which was most doubtful-bis people would
                        never submit. France should consider the consequences of her action.</p>

                        precious stones. Apparently, during their long voyage of several weeks from
                        their native country they refused all food. On the first day of their
                        arrival at Ghizeh they continued their self-imposed fast, but on the second
                        day one of these enormous batrachians seized and swallowed three live young
                        rats in the space of five minutes, and then settled down to a meal of
                        earth-worms, which is expected-to form their usual diet during their stay in

                    <head>THE FATE OF NELSON'S SIGNALMAN.</head>
                    <p>The finding, in a state of abject destitu- tion, forty one years after
                        Trafalgar, of tho man who, with his own hands, hoisted Deleon's signal on
                        board the Victory, is a pathetic little story. It was quite acci- dental,
                        and through a medical man, then living in South London, the son of the sur-
                        geon of another old Trafalgar man-o'-war, the Tonnant. The doctor, as he
                        himself relates, bad a practice in the then respectable neighbourhood of
                        Upper Stamford- street, Black friara, when one day, in the winter of 1816,
                        something prompted him to take notice of "an old and broken-down man who
                        made a scanty livelihood by crying watercress and red herrings through the
                        streets." He had often seen the old man, who appeared to be a quick,
                        sharp-witted old man, and had a gTeat reputation for sagacity among the
                        lower class of neighbours. Becoming interested in him, the doctor in due
                        course, had some inquiries made, during which a surprising fact came out "We
                        discovered that be was an old sailor named John Roome, and that ho had
                        served with Nelson at Trafalgar— in fact, that he was then a signalman on
                        board the Victory. That led to further inquiries,and one day the old man was
                        called indoors and questioned, with a view of seeing if anything could be
                        done to better his position. "I at length," says the doctor, "took the
                        opportunity of calling the man in, and then seating him before me, asked him
                        : Who was the signal officer on board the Victory at Trafalgar 1 He replied
                        : Mr. Pasoo, sir. Did you serve under him ? Yea. Who, then, hoisted the
                        signal 'England expects every man to do his duty' 11 did. I bad felt
                        somewhat prepared for this answer; still, as it was uttered I could scarce-
                        ly refrain from a demonstration ,of reverenca towards the old embarrassed
                        signalman, who sat uneasily before me."</p>
                    <p>Old Roome was then 63 years of age. Ha had been a seaman from his early
                        youth, although be had served only three or four years in the Royal Navy.
                        His intelligence and smartness as a lad got him rated A3, soon after
                        entering the Navy, and then he became a signalman. After Trafalgar unfor-
                        tunately he had deserted, ad the "K" (Run) against his name debarred him
                        from pension. The case, however, was brought to the notice of Captain Pasco
                        (Nelson's flag-lieutenant at Trafalgar), then filling the post of captain of
                        the Victory, and be took up the cause of "my old shipmate," as be called
                        Roome, warmly, and in the end so successfelly that be was able to get Roome
                        admitted to Greenwich Hospital as in-pensioner for life. At Greenwich old
                        Roome lived for thirteen years in comfort, and making a "good thing," we are
                        told, out of the ' tips" given him by old naval officers and their friends.
                        He died in December, 1860, in the same month that saw the launch of the
                        first ironclad ever built for the British Navy, the Warrior.</p>
                    <p>Roome's discovery and arrival at Green- wich Hospital, it would appear from
                        all accounts, was not received very warmly there. It spoiled a pretty little
                        game that had been^going on for years, and' seriously affected a very
                        profitable little business that Some of the Greenwich pensionera had long
                        carried on at Greenwich in the neighbourhood of the Hospital, particularly
                        with country visitors to the place, who were always asking to be shown "the
                        man who hoisted Nelson's signal. The pensioners, we are told, were always
                        ready, to oblige. Some "Greenwich canary"—as pensioners in disgrace for
                        getting drunk on Sunday, who wore the punishment dress of a long, yellow
                        coat with red sleeve*, in place of the ordinary dark wine uniform coat— was,
                        it is on record, as a regular thing palmed off on the gaping visitors ss the
                        very man. It wss added, to improve the occasion and draw more coppers, that
                        the peculiar garb of the ' canaries," of whom there were always three or
                        four to be seen about, was "worn as a special Admiralty privilege
                        exclusively by men who had foughton board the Victory at Trafalgar!" It is
                        on record furthermore, indeed, that some- times two or three of the
                        "canaries" themselves would be showing people round at the same time, each
                        touring his own little party of country visitors, and passing himself off as
                        the one and only Trafalgar signalman in existence.</p>

                    <head>EXHIBITION OF BRITISH GROWN COTTON.</head>
                    <p>The British Cotton Growers' Association's exhibition of cotton grown within
                        the limits of the British Empire was,-opened in Man chaster last week by the
                        Lord Mayor. The exhibition includes a'l specimens which were displayed some
                        time ago at the Imperial Institute, with many additions. There was on view
                        Sea Island cotton from the West Indies tree cotton and Egyptian cotton from
                        India Egypitian and American cotton from Eat Africa, and native and American
                        cotton Iron West Africa. Mr. J. A. Hutton, vice president of the
                        association, said visitor to the exhibi- tion could see for themselves the
                        truth of the assertion that cotton suitable for Lancashire could be grown in
                        the British Empire. The samples were taken from shipments represent . ing
                        the production of thousands of acres. The bad already received this year
                        over 4,0O0 bales from the West Indies, over 3,000 from West Africa, and ever
                        500 bales from east Africa representing a value of well over £100,000 Large
                        shipment were coming in every week, and then was every reason to hope that
                        before the end of the year we should have received over £200,O00 worth of
                        cotton, every pound of which was due to the work of the association.</p>

                        route for India. The King and Queen and other members of the Royal family,
                        as well as the more imme- diate friends of the Royal travellers, assembled
                        to bid them God-speed, while the station I, approaches were lined with a
                        large crowd I anxious to give them a hearty send-off. The train left the
                        station amidst rousing cheers shortly before noon, and arrived at Dover boat
                        1.25, the departure for Calais being made a few minutes later. The Royal
                        patty reached Genoa on Friday evening, where they embarked forthwith on
                        H.M.S. Renown, which , is to convey them to India. f i The Renown is doe at
                        Port Said at 8 a.m. on the 27th inst, and at Sues at the same time .on the

                    <p>Final instructions have now been received at Simla with regard to the Royal
                        tour, and General Beatson will leave Simla shortly to complete the details
                        of the reception of the Prince and Princess of Wales at different places. He
                        will go first to the Khyber Pass, where he will superintend the arrangements
                        in connexion with the Prince's inspection, and will then proceed to Lahore,
                        Indore, and Bombay.</p>
                    <p>The recent rainfall has removed anxiety, I and preparations throughout India
                        are pro-1 ceeding apace.</p>
                    <p>During their stay in the coutry the Royal travellers will have more duty than
                        pleasure, bat owing to Lord Carton's splendid command of detail and his
                        wonderful knowledge of the highways and byways, the Prince aDd Princess will
                        travel easily and fare sumptuonsly, while all unnecessary fatigue will be
                        avoided. The Royal train is a marvel of comfort, and is charmingly
                        decorated. In arranging cere- monial visits and durbars the strictest regard
                        has been paid to. the privileges of the native chiefs, and the local
                        governments are heartily co-operating in assuring the success of the I
                        functions.</p>
                    <p>A State ball will take place at Caloutta on January 4, and H.M.S. Renown

                    <head>STATESMENS BLUNDERS.</head>
                    <p>Sir Clements R. Markham, late president of the Royal Geographical Society,
                        last week inaugurated a course of geographical study Cambridge University,
                        and gave instances of mistakes made by statesmen through lack of
                        geographical knowledge.</p>
                    <p>It was on one occasion essential to the inte- rests of our country and of the
                        natives of another that in settling a boundary a certain region should be
                        kept within the British fron- tier. The matter came before a former Prime
                        Minister, which, seeing that a meridian line on a map appeared to bring the
                        region in question within the British frontier, decided that this imaginary
                        line should form the boundary. He did not enquire whether the line was
                        correctly placed, bat thought it was all right because it was on the map,
                        just-aa the old woman thought a story was true because it was in print When
                        the country came to be surveyed it was found that the chosen meridian did
                        not give us the | required region, and much injury and embar- rassment were
                        the consequence. No future Prime Minister, who had gone through a course of
                        surveying and map-making at Cam bridge, could be guilty of snob a blander.
                        Another illustration of the disastrous consequences of ignorance was
                        afforded by the Foreign Office. Great Britain possesses a great dependency
                        in the East, but on its coast there is a small district occupied by a
                        foreign power about two miles in extent Absolutely useless to its possessor,
                        it was a serious incon- venience to us because malefactors constantly
                        escaped over the border, and could not be brought to justice. During the war
                        this district was taken by us, and became part of oar great dependency. But
                        when terms of peace were arranged our Minister for Foreign Affairs, in total
                        ignorance of its position and of the importance of its retention, ceded it
                        to the Power that had previously held it He did so thinking it was a small
                        West Indian island of no consequence. Thus the incon- venience of the proper
                        administration of the country was continued.</p>
                    <p>A much more recent instance of the urgent need that a knowledge of geography
                        should it be possessed by oar raters was shown in the case of the Chumbi
                        Valley, respecting which Sir Frank Young husband made a well considered
                        treaty with the ruling lamas of Tibet Thin "excellent clause in the treaty
                        was disallowed, and its adoption was censured at home because Ministers were
                        ignorant of the position and history of the Chumbi Valley, and of the race
                        to which its inhabitants belong. They thought it was in Tibet It has been
                        occupied for some if years by aggressive lamas, bat is entirely or the
                        Indian side of the Himalayas, wedged in between Sikkim and Bhutan, and the
                        inha- bitants are not Tibetans. -This disastrons reversal of a wise and far
                        seeing arrangement was, in the opinion of <persName>Sir Clements
                            Markham</persName>? detrimental to the interests of our Indian
                        Empire.</p>

                            in the bank of England rate, which remains at 4%, due no doubt to the
                            improved position of the old reserve, which has increased since our last
                            by over £ ,000,000 to £21,672,620. The ratio pf reserve to liabilities

                        <head>The Money Market.</head>
                        <p>With reference to the £1,000,000 of gold which we mentioned last week as
                            likely to be taken for Egypt on its way westward, it is now question
                            whether this may not be reduced y £100,000. At the time of writing there
                            is boot £1,800,000 in gold on the way to this I country, of which about
                            one quarter is doe to arrive next week. Unless a larger demand for
                            shipment than is anticipated at the moment, eta in, we may expect to see
                            a further im- provement in next week's figures. After the announcement
                            that no change was made in the I lank rate, the Consols market hardened
                            1/14 But the gilt-edged securities barely responded to the improved
                            monetary position. There is no change in these worthy of note since last
                            I week, for those who are prepared to look up I heir money, and be
                            content in the meantime I nth a low rate of interest, Consols at the
                            pre- sent prices should certainly afford a good opportunity of making a
                            considerable profit after the turn of the year.</p>

                            If. It is anticipated that the report which is due next month will be of
                            an encouraging nature. Delta Land shares are being quietly bought up in

                            houses directly connected with the Kaffir circus can devise seems to
                            have any effect upon the public mind. There has been steady selling all

                            doubt, of the sugar crash, and the result has been that prices Lave been
                            on the downward grade all the time, Rand being well below 8. Trouble is
                            already beginning to be looked for in the coming settlement here next

                            sympathy with the depression in the Kaffir market, there was a slight
                            easing off in prices. Rhodesia Exploration lost 8/32 at 3 1/3, but in no

                        engagement at Khar (medal with clasp). He was adjutant on the 9th Battalion
                        (North Cork Rifles) in the late Boer War (mentioned in despatches, medal
                        with four clasps, and D.S.0.)</p>
                    <p>It is stated that the Admiralty is about to make soma very important
                        experiments with I motor-propelled torpedo boats and possibly ''destroyers."
                        One of the drawbacks of these craft is the smoke and flame which belch forth
                        from their funnel* when driven at fall power. This especially after night,
                        when they are most useful, indicates their presence, and of coarse detracts
                        from their striking powers. The ap- plication of a suitable motor would
                        remedy this defect, whilst creating a new one, (or petrol is a ticklish
                        cargo to carry in any dam of ship. It would be more so in a torpedo I boat
                        Russians have experimented success- fully.</p>
                    <p>One of the best known cruisers in the fleet, the Calliope, presently moored
                        in "Rotten Row,'' at Mother bank, will, it is believed, shortly change
                        hands, as the Spanish Ad- miralty is negotiating for her purchase with I the
                        view of using her as a training ship for naval cadets, a duty she long
                        discharged in our own navy.. The name of the Calliope came into prominence
                        whilst attached to the Pacific Squadron in 1889, by the gallantry and
                        seamanship her skipper, Captain Kane, displayed in tho awful storm at Apia,
                        Samoa Islands, in the March of that year. Captain Kane steamed out to sea in
                        the teeth of the typhoon, and weathered it, whilst the German and Yankee
                        ships, which remained in the har- bour, were blown ashore, or lost The
                        staunch little cruiser which performed this deed was invariably an object of
                        the keenest interest at the ports she visited during her training ser- vice
                        and recruiting service. If only from a sentimental point if view, she should
                        be retained in our fleet as a monument of the seamanship of her Irish
                        captain and the im- plicit obedience of her crew in a crisis which called
                        forth all that is brave and loyal. To I weather the storm her boilers were
                        loaded practically to the bursting point.</p>
