                    <head>JUVENILE CRIMINALS.</head>
                    <p>Coles Pasha's latest report contains much more detailed information regarding
                        juvenile criminals than has previously been given. It appears that 2,461
                        boys got into trouble for contraventions last year of whom about half were
                        whipped, and the rest imprisoned. They were for tho most part not Arab
                        "hooliggans," but little shoeblacks without their badges, or were guilty of
                        the heinous crime of leading about blind beggars in forbidden quarters.
                        'Assault' is a term as often as not applied to a street son file or
                        squabble, and most of the little thieves appear to be first offenders. It
                        really seems that the police of some towns in Egypt devote an amount of
                        attention to the exploits of small boys that is not justified by their
                        criminality, The Cairo policeman of course makes the largest haul, but it is
                        curious that comparatively small towns like Itai el Barood, Deshna, and
                        Diknrni. should produce l42,69 and 51 oases of juvenile criminality
                        respectively, while Mansonrah only boast. 34, and the large town of Mehalla
                        el Kubra 15.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Justice has established a "Joveaile Court" in Ciin bifi.-j
                        whuh an y youthful offndiri appear. Ai Ctlas t'aifu points oat, tin fait

                        seventy of the punishment is esiased by its brevi y When yon keep, say, a
                        badge lees bootblack f ir five days in gaol and then whip him— a sturdy
                        shawish inflating the penalty—there is nothing to connterbalanoe the pain,
                        which is bat the oalmination of an unpleasant experience. It seems to m that
                        imprisoning your jnvenile offender first, and than inflicting a fresh pun
                        ishment (which is supposed to take the plaos ol imprisonment) on tbe
                        unfortanate little wretffi is a needless piece of oxaelty. Coles Pasha
                        suggests that a special bureau dealing with jnvenile offenders should be
                        organised, and a single member of the Parquet appointed to receive daily
                        reports of oass of offences by children, and the number of children awaiting
                        trial in prieon throughout the ooontry. Snob a measure would check tbe
                        excessive zeal of the type of shawish, who is ready enough to blackmail an
                        arbaghi, or to pounoe upon an annoying boot-black, but will not stop a
                        'oarro' manned by a sturdy carter, from backlog onto the pavement, or bestir
                        himself after midnight to silence a roaring band of festive Berberins, wfcld
                        prevent oarelessness cm the part of the Parquet, and would in a great
                        measure remove the class of juveniles awaiting trial from the prisons. Bat
                        whst is most required is a law providing for waifs an i strays. Gnat as is
                        the charity of the Moslem poor, then an nambers of homeless little vagabonds
                        who live—for no one will ever die of banger in Egypt—bat learn nothing and
                        grow up under conditions that an bound to foster criminal tendencies.</p>

                    <head>LANCASHIRE'S COMING TROUBLE.</head>
                    <p>Judging from the despondent tone of the leading Lancashin papers, it appears
                        only too likely that the cotton industry may be largely paralysed within a
                        fortnight. As usual the cause is a suicidal quarrel between capital and
                        labour, the operatives demanding a 5 per cent addition to the wage rate all
                        round, while their employers contend that the present condition of business
                        does not warrant any augmentation. This would look to be precisely the sort
                        of issue suitable for arbitration, bat on neither side is any desire
                        expressed for that method of settlement. Among the men, a suspicion exists
                        that many of their employers would be rather glad than sorry to limit
                        output, as the best way of connteraoting the renewed efforts of the American
                        ring to create a speculative corner in the raw materiaL Its price has been
                        lately poshed op almost to prohibitive level by those gamblers, and on the
                        last occasion of the sort, it was found that the best remedy was the
                        limitation of manufacturing produc tion. The Lancashire mill owners also
                        contend that the moderate profits they are now making go bat a little way
                        towards wiping oat the enormous losses they suffered daring the cotton
                        famine. The operatives urge,on the other hand, that they suffered even more
                        through the loss of wages. Without weighing these conflicting arguments in
                        comparative scales, we cannot too vehemently recommend both parties to
                        accept arbitration, sooner than embark in hostilities beneficial only to
                        their foreign com petitors, and absolutely ruinous to the great British
                        industry on whose prosperity their own wholly depends.</p>

                    <p>The following circular was issued yesterday. by the Ministry of the Interior
                        :-</p>
                    <p>In view of the recent dainage to cotton at Arment, Markaz Luxor, it is
                        considered advisable to prepare the following note for the information of
                        cultivators who should do all in their power to further our knowledge of the
                        life-history of this pest, by carefully observing its habits, food-plants,
                        time of ap pearance, method of passing the winter, etc.</p>

                        to success. fully cope with it..</p>
                    <p>The boll-worm is a very serious past, causing. annually considerable loss to
                        the cotton crop of this countly. The parent of the boll-worm is s moth which
                        can be readily recognised trom the following characteristics. Thorax and
                        fore wings green, hind wings silvery white with a darkish inargin, abdomen
                        same colour as hind wings. It has a wing expanse of about 20 mm., and the
                        body is about 9 mm. long. The eggs. are laid on the outer surface of the
                        boll, gene- rally in one of the grooves near the tip. Only one is laid on a
                        boll, but, as, several moths may each deposit an egg on the same boll, two
                        or three are sometimes found. These eggs, which are of a blueish green
                        colour and about 0.5 mm. in diameter, in three or four days time give rise
                        to a small larva or worm, which at once proceeds to bore into the boll and
                        feed upon the contents.</p>
                    <p>As the worm grows it seeks other bolls which it pierces, and devours the
                        seeds. Daring its life a larva will enter and destroy several capsules. The
                        presence of the worm in the boll can always be detected by the small round
                        hole in the side with a quantity of excrement around it. When young bolls
                        are invaded they gener ily wither up and fall off, but older and maturing
                        bolls seem to dry up without dropping. Even if they do open, the fibre is so
                        matted together and stained by the excrement of the worm that it is
                        practically valueless. In some cases, where only one division of the boll
                        has been damaged, the other may open and produce good cotton.</p>
                    <p>In from fifteen to twenty days the worm reaches maturity, and is then about
                        14 to 15 mm long, and robust. It is provided with a number of fleshy
                        tubercles which give it a apiky appearance. These are most marked near the
                        head, and are surrounded at the base by an orange-coloured patch. The worm
                        now leaves the boll and spins a cocoon somewhere on the plant, frequently
                        between the side of the ball and the involucre. The cocoon is formed of
                        tough, densely woven silk which varies in colour from white and cream to
                        brown. It is more or less oval in shape, and "keeled" along the upper
                        surface. Within this, the larva turns to a yellowish brown pupa about 10 mm.
                        long. The cocoon of the boll worm is lighter in colour and smaller in size
                        than that of the cotton worm. In from ten to fourteen days moths emerge and
                        give rise to another brood of worms which feed in the same way. There are a
                        number of generations during the year.</p>
                    <p>Until we know more about the life-history and habits of this pest it is
                        impossible to devise any practical method of dealing with it. Cultivators

                        registered being 7.27 metres as compared with 5.52 metres in the previous
                        day. This rise will be felt in Cairo in about 25 days, and will be generally
                        beneficial to Lower Egypt, but not to Upper Egypt, where the canal basins
                        will probably be only opened in the last week of August, as in 1902. The

                            an assault by an Arab on an Italian lady in her own home. It appears

                    <head>SUAKIN-BERBER RAILWAY.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent in the "Engineer" gives some particulars of the Suakin-Berber
                        Railway, which will reduce the distance of Khartoum from the sea by 970
                        miles. The line really starts 20 miles south of Berber, at the month of the
                        Atbara, and runs to Port Sudan, 30 miles north of Suakin, to which it is
                        much superior as a port. The selection of the route for the railway was
                        influenced as much by the opportunities for fature extensions as by gra
                        dients, earth work, and water supply. After surveying the country, the route
                        via Khor Okwat, Khor Adit, Kbor Baraméy, Khor Arab, and Khor Hudi was
                        chosen. The highest point on the line is near Sinkat, 89 miles by rail from
                        Port Sudan, where the road rises to 3,020 ft. above the sea. The total
                        length of the railway from Atbara to Port Sudan is 312 miles. A single line
                        3 ft. 6 in gauge is employ- ed. The steepest gradient between Port Sudan and
                        Sinkat is 1 in 100, and between Sinkat and Atbara 1 in 125, whilst the
                        sharpest curve is 955 ft. radius. The rails are flat-bottomed, 75 lb. to the
                        yard between Sinkat and Atbara. The sleepers are of Jarrah wood for 50 miles
                        from Port Sudan, but beyond that they are of steel. One flat and one angle
                        fish-plate is used. The rails are fastened to the wooden sleepers by keys.
                        The points will be bolt-locked and interlocked with signals. The work of
                        con- struction began in earnest in October, 1904, and 170 miles were laid
                        altogetber up to Jane 1. Railhead is now advancing at a rate of about 1,500
                        yards a day; but the laying of the rails will probably not be finished
                        before March, 1906. The briges will not be finished by March, 1906; so that
                        a certain amount of damage may be expected during the rains in November and
                        December, 1905. If, as occasionally happens, there is not much rain, the
                        laying of the rails may be finished a few months earlier,</p>

                        or dropping from the skies at every imagina ble point. While we attempted to
                        cross, the first defile a volley of gunfire poured upon us from both sides
                        of the ravines, alternating with the pelting, of stones, and the rolling
                        down of boulders. A stone struck me on the face, and it would have smashed
                        the bones had it not been friable as the stones in that special region are.
                        The attack was, so vigo: rous, and the position of the enemy was to
                        manifestly superior, that the soldiers, already perhaps not much in sympathy
                        with the ob- ject of the expedition, lost courage. Our commander saw the
                        hopelessness of the posi- tion, and thentter uselessness of fighting under
                        such conditions, and like a prudent-man, bot a bad general, forthwith
                        decided upon sur- render. The Arabs rushed down on us like valtures from the
                        surrounding dark, oljffa orying "Sallem" "Sallem" ("earrender" "sur
                        render"). He who did not promptly lay down his arms and give up his
                        cartridge belt was shot down or cleft in twain by the mar vellous swords of
                        the infernal Arabs. The disarming over, the camels, severals thousands in
                        number, were then captured with their intact loads of provisions, and an
                        army of about 10,000 strong was then left to procred to Sana, still
                        resisting yet powerless The garrison of 10 battalions at Sana had been
                        waiting with famished endurance for the pro- visions, and you can picture to
                        yourselt their distress on seeing the long-expected blessing arrive in the
                        hands of the enemy. We arrived at Sana to swell the number of the famished
                        and add to the death roll, for not less than five to six thousand men out of
                        our 20 battalions died, very few in actual fighting but mostly from famine.
                        Farther resistance was no more possible. Sana is a natural stronghold
                        perched on the top of a high mountain, and farther fortified by a rampart
                        wall. The principal water supply, however, lies in wells outside the wall,
                        while within its limits vegetation, as may be imagin- ed on a barren hill of
                        Arabia, is far from lux- ariant. The provisions had been so late in
                        arriving, and the siege was kept up so lorg that the famine in the town was
                        reaching its uttermost limits. When we entered the town our hearts broke at
                        the sight of desolation within. Nothing green could be seen. The place had
                        been stripped of the syn bolic coloor of good fortune. Even the roots of
                        plants in the pota, that had been placed for ornament on the window sills,
                        had been placked and eaten away, On the first surrender after the opening

                                    <p>Description of imprisonment.</p>
                                    <p>It will be seen that of the 81,745 prisoners sentenced,
                                        24,825 or 30%, were in default, 34,278 or 41% were sentenced
                                        to simple im- prisonment, 21,950 or 26% to imprisonment with
                                        labour, 150 to detention and 597 to penal servitude. In 1903
                                        472 were sentenced to penal servitude, 118 to detention and
                                        16,606 to imprisonment, with labour, prisoners sentenced in
                                        default were included with those sentenced to simple
                                        imprisonment.</p>
                                    <p>Classification of offences and periods of imprisonment.</p>
                                    <p>It appears that whilst the number of prison- ers who
                                        underwent, imprisonment for contra ventions was reduced by
                                        more than 50%, there was a large increase of persons
                                        imprisoned for délit compared with 1903. It will be seen,
                                        too. that the increase in the prison population in 1904 is
                                        owing to the increase, in number of sen- tence of from "one
                                        week, to three months" and not, as was at one time supposed,
                                        owing to an increase of those sentenced to longer periods,
                                        the numbers of which have varied little during the past
                                        three years.</p>
                                    <p>These sentenced prisoners are again clas sified as regards
                                        their age, nationality, sto. The proportion is very similar
                                        to previous years and the tables call for no particular
                                        explanation.</p>
                                    <p>Habitual offenders.</p>
                                    <p>The number of "Habituala" is ever-increas ing, 7,295 having
                                        been sent to prison during the year compared with 6,842
                                        during 1909. Of this number, 2,481 were convicted of
                                        offences against property (1,566 in 1903), 2,485 against the
                                        person (1,817 in 1908), and 2,429 other offences (1,959 in
                                        1903).</p>
                                    <p>If, as last year, we compare the sentences we find that 81%
                                        were imprisoned for less than one year (85% in 1903). If
                                        offences against property be alone considered 61% received
                                        less than one year (59% in 1903). Simple impri- sonment is
                                        hardly a suitable punishment for men who have already
                                        undergone imprison- ment and yet 1,577 offenders were so
                                        dealt with; not a few of whom had four, five and more
                                        previous convictions.</p>
                                    <p>Bgyptian Judges undoubtedly deal very, leniently with this
                                        class of offender.</p>
                                    <p>Habituals sentenced to penal servitude.</p>
                                    <p>The number of old offenders sentenced to penal servitude has
                                        increased from 68 to 914 Of this number, 153 were sentenced
                                        under the new law, about half this number coming under Arts.
                                        274-275 (aggravated theft).</p>
                                    <p>With penal servitude, punishment for such offenders may be
                                        said to be exhausted, and when these men return to prey on
                                        society (which in all probability the majority of them, will
                                        do) we shall have to face the problem, so much disqussed of
                                        late years in England and elsewhere, of the best method of
                                        dealing with incorrigibles.</p>
                                    <p>-Personally I have no doubt that there is bat one remedy for
                                        such off anders, viz., an inde finite sentence in an adult
                                        reformatory or asylum. Experts may decide whether the par
                                        tionlar form of vice shall be dealt with as inherited or
                                        acquired; all the community ask, and have a right to expect,
                                        is that such persons shall be removed from their midst.</p>
                                    <p>• This includes persons from Administrative Courte Probably
                                        more were actually imprisoned and not returned by the
                                        Parquet as old offenders.</p>

                        extortion,, especially in connection with the Askerieh (military exemp tion
                        tax.) The ignorant Arabs used to be given false receipts for the Askerieh
                        money, which of course the succeeding governors would not recognise.
                        Continued injustice and oppression led finally to open revolt, which the
