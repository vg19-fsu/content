          <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
            Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation for
            tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry proprietor).
            Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect
            climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to Mr. Najem Houry,
            Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a
            good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine
            old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
            other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the
            tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's "Lover's Melancholy.'' The
            climate of Cyprus in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a
            visit. </p>

            Son, Egypt, or from the General Manager Railways, Famagusta. G. BERT DAY, General

          <p>ARABIC FOR "FLOWS THE WATER."</p>
          <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil. Deliciously
            scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can do, makes it pearly white,
            gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to
            the skin. </p>
          <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be called
              <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to give it the
            necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the effects of hard
            water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to overheated blood, and to
            preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates are so fatal. </p>
          <p>Invaluable for immediately curing mosquito and insect bites and for greatly preventing
            them. </p>

          <head>EGYPTIAN PROGRESS AND RADICAL CRITICS.</head>
          <p>Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P., is contributing • series of articles to one of the
            newspapers in his constituency on the British control of Egypt. The first of this series
            of articles will be found in another column of to-day's issue After enunciating a number
            of truisms about che Government of this country interspersed with due tributes to Lord
            Cromer 8 work he binds up with the conclusion that, inasmuch as the material prosperity
            and financial solvency of the country have not been accompanied by moral and
            intellectual progress, therefore there is something rotten in the state of Egypt. This
            Radical critic of Anglo-Egyptian admi: nistrative methods falls into the common error of
            all his political kith and kin Their enthusiasms are generous but dangerous because they
            are based on erroneous generalisations Just as Mr. Massingham in his recent article in
            the "Nation" jumps to the conclusion hat the demands of the General Assembly are
            evidences of enlightened political intelligence, so Mr. Robertson holds that because
            Egypt prefers its old ethos, despite the fact that externally and financially all is
            changed, therefore there is something very wrong in Anglo-Egyptian methods. The truth is
            that we have been forced by circumstances to introduce western methods and ought not to
            expect immediate results. If we have been obliged to force the pace of external reform,
            it does not follow that the country ought necessary. arily to show a similar degree of
            progress, intellectual and ethical. </p>
          <p>It might at once occur to some, who give a asty consideration to the subject, that our
            remarks are entirely belied by the rapid rise in hat is called civilisation of that,
            geographically, most Oriental people, the Japanese, at the comparison between them and
            the gyptians will not bear examination. The two ices are, in fact, totally dissimilar.
            The island position of the Japanese must be contrasted with the continental situation of
            Egypt, which has been the highway of every great invasión, it Persian, Greek, Roman,
            Arab, or French. here has, moreover, never been any national spirit in Egypt, for the
            very good reason that i'm the dawn of history they have never been warned by men of
            their own race. We all <cb n="6"/> know the influence of climate, and that, too may have
            had its share in differentiating the Ftwo racoa. The true reason, the elemental factor
            of the everlasting unchangeableness of Egypt, may be probably sought in the circumg the
            distance that she possesses one single source o Jo.. life, to which every living thing
            must conform or vanish. The Nile is the only lord and give life to Egypt. The eternal
            type, in which the Great River has moulded the land and everything in it, must be
            implicitly.obeyed and all and every recalcitrant featuré must ets. either assimilate or
            succumb. </p>
          <p>An instructive example of this was invention ed some time ago in one of the Balletins
            of the Khedivial Geographical Society, where it was remarked that some fine breed of
            Euro pean cattle, after being transplanted into Egypt for a few years, began to assume
            beladi characteristics. What is true of the stockyard is true also in history, Of al the
            many and mighty laces that have sojourned in the land not a single physical trace
            remains, and the influence of the centuries of Ptolemaic sovereignty are as much
            obliterated as the hundreds of years of Roman rule. There is a more modern case of this
            strange power of assimilation. For six hundred years during the Mamluk era there was a
            steady annual 'drafting of Circussian men and women into ERU Egypt ; yet there has never
            been a colony of pure Circassian race domiciled in Egypt. No · race can for long,
            withstand the racial and climatic influences of "a land where all things always seem the
            same." Lord Cromer in his Report on Egypt in 1903 drew attention to the fact that the
            conditions of life in ancient Egypt, as revealed by the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, point "to
            the conclusion that when, in recent years, Egyptian reform was taken seriously in hand,
            the reformers had, in many cases, to deal with practices which had existed, without
            undergoing any very material change, for at least 1,800 years." The game words probably
            were used 3,300 years ago by Rekhmara to Thothmes III. in an era of Egyptian prosperity
            as great as the present, when that statesman. of thirty-three centuries ago drew his
            sovereign's attention to the rapid progress Egypt has made of late years. </p>
          <p>We are engaged in Egypt in an attempt to crowd the revolutions in fact and in idea,
            which in Europe have been the slow growth of centuries, into as many decades, without
            even halting to assure ourselves that things which owe their initiative to the genius of
            Europe, and are the ripening fruits of her maturity, are equally suited to the genius of
            the East. Even in the case of European civilisation; "while the advances made by
            objective science and its industrial applications are palpable and undeniable, it is a
            matter of doubt and dispute if our social and moral advance towards happiness and virtue
            has been great or any." So said a well-known English thinker; but to apply such
            reflections to modern Egypt might by some be considered to savour of heresy. That such a
            "point of view should be held here. tical is very natural, for it is a generally
            received fallacy of the present day that man, - as he exists, whether Oriental or
            European, is capable of net progress. We are always under an illusion of progress in
            Egypt, because wherever we are conscious of an evil we remedy it, and therefore always
            seem to ourselves to be progressing, forgetting that most of the evils we see are the
            effects, finally become acute, of long-unnoticed retrogressions, and that our
            compromising remedies seldom fully recover the lost ground. This is the illusion of
            illusions, whereby we judge that the follah, inasmuch as he is developing from a
            vegetarian to a carnivorous animal, sleeps in a bedstead, and uses the telegraph to
            gamble on the Alexandria Bourse in futures, is a more excellent person than his
            grandsire, who never ate nothing but "ful" and whose highest ideal of happiness was to
            escape the corvée. Why should we not think so ? Is oot the chauffeur, who drives a
            motor-car from Paris to Berlin, a more highly evolved man than the charioteer of
            Achilles ? Is not the modern Prime Minister a more enlightened ruler than Cæsar because
            he rides &amp; tricycle and writes his despatches by electric light? Whilst man remains
            what he is, there can be no progress beyond the point already attained and fallen
            headlong from at every attempt at civilisation; and since even that point is but a
            pinnacle to which a few people cling in giddy terror above an abyss of squalor, mere
            progress should no longer charm us. The progress fallacy is widespread but very simple.
            We read of the old unregenerate Egypt and we conclude that the abuses of those days are
            quite things of the past. The curve is abolished, public education is made into a
            system, sanitary by-laws are multiplied, the Alexandria Municipality is founded, the
            octroi is done away with, irrigation is improved, the effendi wears tweed suits, the Bey
            drives motor-cars. All these and such-like changes produce an illusion of bustling
            progress, and it is inferred that the abuses of a generation ago no longer exist" except
            as interesting pages in Lady Duff Gordon's Letters from Egypt. But the moment we look
            for a reform due to the character of the people themselves we are disillusioned ;
            instead, we find that as they become more prosperous their criminality increases. This
            is no new conclusion. The lespair of institutions, and the inexorable "'ye must be born
            again," with Mrs. Poyser's stipulation, "and horn - different," recurs in every
            generation ; for man, as he is, never vill, nor can, add a cubit to his stature by any
            of the quackeries of progress <hi rend="italic">Plus a change plus c'est la même
              chose</hi>, will ever be true of Egypt.</p>

              entertainment to the members It would appear that the organisation has fallen too

            Sir E Grey : I have nothing to add to the reply which I made on Nov. 22 last. It is

          <head>SANIEH GIRLS' SCHOOL,<lb/>ANNUAL DRILL DISPLAY.</head>
          <p>In spite of other attractions, many ladies e found their way to the Sanieh Girls'
            School on Wednesday afternoon, when the annual drill display and sale of work was in
            progress. From the road outside no one could have any idea of the brightness and charm
            of the big.airy build ing which, with its wide verandahs and corridors, is built around
            the square garden within. It was a gala day for the big crowd of happy looking children
            who in dainty white frocks with sashes and hair-knots of various colours thronged the
            verandahs all ready for the afternoon's performances. Miss Johnstone and her staff stood
            ready to receive guests, and soon after Lady Cromer's arrival the serious business of
            the afternoon commenced. The students of the Training College were the first to March
            across the paved path across the garden sand give a short display of dumbbell exercises.
            t They were promptly followed by a bevy of the o younger scholars, their Boy white
            frocks relieved with sashes, etc., of belivtr pe, and they performed their Swedial
            exercises with a tpre-ision and briskness that spöke volumes for the training that had
            been bestowed upon them. They in their turn were followed by a delightful crowd of
            kindergarten babies who trotted placidly to their place and spoke their little
            recitations with delightful naiveté ; "The three little kittens" being recited with much
            expression and evident enjoyment. The children of the preparatory class armed with
            scarlet scarves and sashes did their scarf drill, and others with touches of pink about
            them performed pretty evolutions with small hoops covered also in pink. Then there were
            other recitations and pole exercises hy a class whose dresses were relieved by touches
            of green in various shades, and finally a maypole dance was performed by eight tiny tots
            with great aplomb and much holding out of little skirts and pointing of baby toes. The
            entire display, with its happy-looking bands of juvenile perco formers, was in every way
            a most credible d performance and compared very well with ve those other displays of a
            like nature in England. It was delightful, too, to watch the same -- children in the
            great big playground after y wards, fitting about in their pretty frocks and osashes,
            busily employed in games, swinging, etc., and as thoroughly enjoying life as any t,
            English children on an extra half-holiday. 8 In another building the sale of work was h
            in progress, the elder girls taking charge of the - various stalls. There were some
            beautiful v examples of needle.craft on exhibition, drawn linen work, needle lace, and
            embroidery, which h it would be hard to/beat So much were all us these pretty articles
            in request that by the - end of the afternoon there was scarcely en article which did
            not bear the magio ticket 1, "Sold" upon it. </p>
          <p>Tea was served upon the verandah, the children acting as excellent hosts and attendants
            ; their politeness and pretty manners being fitting complements to their bright faces
            and dainty frocks. </p>
          <p>Most of the classrooms and dormitories were thrown open for inspection ; and school
            life under such ideal conditions would be shorn of half its horrors The best of school.
            room fitments are in requisition : the latest | patterned desks and all the usual
            paraphernalia n to which we are accustomed to at home. The elder students who are being
            trained especially | for teachers have their own separate classrooms and the work they
            do therein redounds much to their credit. Some 25% of the pupils (there are over 200 on
            the rolls) are boarders, and their dormitories are bright, airy apart ments furnished
            with the same attention to detail as all the rest of the school. </p>
          <p>Miss Johnson may well be proud of her - school and her big flock of pupils : for accus|
            tomed as we are to such entertainments among girls' schools at home, we have never
            witnessed anything better arranged or more satisfactory than this annual display at the
            Sanieh School. We hope at some future date to be able to give a further and more
            detailed account of this school and of the excellent training it is giving to such
            numbers of the coming generation of Cairo.</p>

          <head>THE VILLAGE TRAGEDY.<lb/>NATIONALIST TACTICS.</head>
          <p>We learn that M. Grandmoulin, who is accused of wilful murder and what not by the
            *Egyptian Standard," was carrying his gun in one hand just before the accident at Warrak
            and with the other holding his bicycle. He was just about to take his gun to pieces when
            e he heard a boy who was with him cry out and turned sharply to see what was the matter.
            The gun exploded and the charge struck another boy who had come up unnoticed by M.
            Grandmoulin and killed him. The story that M. Grandmoulin had an altercation with the
            boy is absolutely false : he had not seen him before the gun went off. </p>
          <p>Such is the lamentable event out of which "Al Lewa"and its European gladiators are
            attempting to make capital. M. Grandmoulin is an eminent jurist of 60 years of age, the
            last man ia the world to shoot a child in cold blood, but probabilities are nothing to
            the "Lewa," and the fact that M. Grandmoulin was director of the School of Law at the
            time of the students' strike has doubtless contributed to the bitterLess with which he
            has been attacked. But the real motive of the attack we realise too fally: incitation
            against the European-despite the grandiloquent device anent freedom a d Hospitality
            which . decorates the "Egyptian Standard." It is part of the game played before the
            Alexandria riots, played during the Akaba incident, played during the past summer.
            Some-day these incitations will lead to bloodshed, and the miserable dupes of Mustapha
            Pasha and his followers perforce atcne for the deliberate and studied incitations of
            their leaders. </p>
          <p>The French Consulate at Cairo is holding an enquiry into the matter. </p>
          <p>We understand that M. Grandmoulin contemplates bringing an action against "L'Etendard

          <p>The White Star Line steamer Arabic, as |duly announced, arrived in port yesterday
            morning early bringing a large number of Amee rican tourists who were speedily landed
            and Tsent off by special train to Cairo. Some of them will remain in the capital for a
            few days and some will continue their journey to Luxor and Issouan. The lunding of these
            passengers was el conducted in a manner reflecting a great deal of praise on the
            management of the F. C. Clark Company as everything seemed to work very smoothly. The
            monotony of the journey from e ship to shore had been carefully considered, - and in

            Considering that this thoughtful provision will not only have saved time in rendering a
            visit to the native bazaar a work of supererogation e but will at the same time have
            saved money 'The F. C. Clark Company is to be congratulated on having got ahead of the
            other tourist agencies in this respect. The music and dancing were very much

          <head>BRITISH CONTROL OF EGYPT.<lb/>THE CONSULAR AUTOCRACY.</head>
          <p>Mr. JM Robertson writes as follows in the "North Mail" of Newcastle. We have dealt with
            the article in our leader : </p>
          <p>"Never, I think, has such a political situation occurred in British history as that
            which now exists in Egypt ; indeed, it would be difficult to match it in any European
            history whatever. In many records we meet with governors of.. colonies and dependencies
            who are allowed a pretty free hand, whether by constitutional or unconstitutional
            governments. But a governor who is allowed more power than a nominally! absolute ruler ;
            a governor whom his "home" 11 Government never dreams of "instructing":, a governor so
            privileged that no one ever seeks to overrule him, his only difficulties being those
            inseparable from his task-such a potentate is hard to find in history before Lord
            Cromer. </p>
          <p>In naming that distinguished man, I desire to say that any ensuing criticism of mine is
            directed first and last against the system of: which he is the 'no adethat all against
            the man as man. Some people assume that all that is needed to secure the proper
            government of Egypt is to recall the present Consul General and heads of departments,
            and appoint others in their place. And, indeed, this simple theory of things is
            countenanced by Lord Cromer himself, who is fond of quoting Talleyrand to the effect
            that the secret of good government | consists in finding the right men for the different
            posts. On that view, serious miscarriage means merely that there should be a change of
            men. </p>
          <p>THE SYSTEM, NOT THE MAN. </p>
          <p>I take leave to challenge such a view, in Lord Cronier's own interest. Under his 11
            supremacy, some branches of Egyptian administration have gone far wrong ; but, looking
            at the administration as a whole, one is bound to admit that in other regards we might
            go further and fare worse. As regards finance in particular, no one disputes the wisdom
            of Lord Cromer's management. Another man might easily set up a much better educational
            policy, for instance, and a much worse financial. </p>
          <p>The question, then, is not one of men but one of systems ; not one of administrative,
            errors, but of rigl t or wrong conditious of administration. And the general case
            against the present system is that it is in its essentials a negation of every
            regulative principle on which the government of the British Empire has been, and is,
            carried on in any other quarter of the world. India and the Crown Colonies are, in
            comparison, constitutionally governed. Colonial governors can initiate nothing save
            under approval of the Colonial Office. The Viceroy of India consults with his Council,
            and the whole machine is subject to the control of the Secretary of State in London, who
            is advised by his Council. </p>
          <p>Over Egypt there is hardly a semblance of control ; of reality there is none. In reply
            to a question in the last Parliament it was officially avowed that the Ministers of the
            Khedive must do what the British ConsulGeneral insists upon. That is to say, the British
            Army of Occupation in Egypt will, if necessary, enforce his orders. The ConsulGeneral,
            on his part, has declared in one of his reports that, far from being a "benevolent
            despot," he is under the orders of the Foreign Secretary, who is responsible to the
            British Parliament. That is the theory of the situation, so far as any theory can be
            said to exist. But the actual fact is that the Foreign Secretary takes no cognisance of
            anything done in the Egyptian Administration save when it is forced on his notice ; that
            he seeks to exercise no control ; and that be deprecates, directly or indirectly, any
            request that he should overrule the policy of the Consul-General at Cairo. </p>
          <p>In saying this I am not criticising personally Sir Edward Grey any more than Lord
            Cromer. The present Foreign Secretary did not create the anomaly of the present British
            control in Egypt, any more than did his predecessor. Entering into the heritage of that
            anomaly, he seeks to get along with as little friction as possible. To impose an
            effective home control on the Consul-General at Cairo would involve something like the
            establishment of a new Government Department in London.- Sir Edward may legitimately
            argue that for the Foreign Office to undertake to supervise the entire government of
            Egypt would merely be to set up an anomaly. </p>
          <p>ABSOLUTISM. </p>
          <p>But the mere official wish for official peace and quietness cannot fitly be allowed to
            deter.. mine the policy of democracy in this country as regards Egypt The present system
            is one which could never have been contemplated, save as a momentary arrangement, by any
            British Government. Neither Liberals not Tories could ever have planned that for an
            indefinite term of years, possibly for generations, a series of British Consuls-General
            should exercise a practical autocracy in Egypt. No amount of esteem for any one
            Consul-General could reconcile rational statesmen to the thought of making the office of
            Consul-General in any country one of practically irresponsible power. The situation is
            admittedly one which has grown up fortuitously, as the outcome of a series of reluctant
            and opportunist interventions ; and it is more than time that so irregular and so
            indefensible an, arrangement should be thoroughly reconsidered </p>
          <p>That it has been allowed to exist so far is: unquestionably due to the general British
            opinion that Lord Cromer has managed Egyptian affairs very well, inasmuch as he has put
            the finances on a sound footing, met all the charges of the national debt, and so dealt
            with irrigation that the material prosperity of the count- <cb n="6"/> try has visibly
            advanced. On the financial pore, foreign States have acquiesced because the claims of
            their subjects holding Egyptian bonds have been steadily satisfied.</p>
          <p>The first requisite, however, for a jnat judgment of the Egyptian situation is a full
            reógnition of the fact that mere material prosperity and financial solvency would not be
            regarded in any European country of high civilization as an ideal state of things, if
            accompanied by moral and intellectual protest ; nay, would, in the latter case, be
            regarded almost as a dangerous symptom. and that the moral and intellectual results of
            the past quarter of a century of British domination in Egypt have been seriously
            unsatisfactory, I propose to show in subsequent articles. That they should be
            unsatisfactory night, I think, be seen by thoughtful politicians o be inevitable. But I
            propose to show as much, in detail, to those who decline to take I for granted.</p>

              <p>House of Commons.-A recriminatory debate took place . yesterday evening on the
                Colonial Vote. The Opposition. taunted the Government with sanctioning in the New
                Hebrides worse conditions than those of the Chinese labour in the Transvaal. They
                charged them with gerrymandering the Transvaal in the interest of the Boers, who
                have now proved themselves in no wise hostile towards Chinese labour.. </p>
              <p>Mr. Winston Churchill and Sir E. Grey warmly responded, upholding the New Hebri.
                dos Convention and rebutting the accusation · of favouring the Boers. </p>
              <p>Sir E. Grey strongly deprecated making the Chinese labour question the cause of
                friction between the Transvaal and Imperial Governments. </p>

            <head>THE SULTAN AS KHALIFA.</head>
            <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE" </p>
            <p>Sir, - The widely divergent views expressed by several correspondents in the
              "Gazette' reflect truly the conflicting opinions held ir Islam on the position of the
              Sultan as Khalifa | Indeed, ever since the death of the prophet - Mohamed, nol
              question has arisen in the Moslem world which has caused so much trouble and division
              amongst the faithful as that of the Imamate or Khalifate. </p>
            <p>"Verily there is no prophet (to come) after me, and the time is near when there will
              be after me a great many Khalifas," said Mohamed but he took no steps towards
              appointing any person to the post, and this, undoubtedly, foi the reason that he
              wished the office to be an elective one, and to give his followers full liberty of
              choice. For a time the will of the people prevailed, but later on the post became the
              prey of the strong man and it has remained so to this day in so far as it has existed
              as an office, though it is true the Sultan of Turkey on ascending the throne is
              formally elected Khalifa by the College of Ulema at Constantinople. </p>
            <p>The necessity for such a head was not that of religion or law, but of administration.
              The law, both spiritual and temporal, as given in the Koran, was final and still
              remains above the office of Sultan or Imám : but an administration requires &amp;
              head, and as long as the world of Islam formed one state, one leader - sufficed. When,
              however, in the course of time Islam was divided into independent states, each state
              required its own Sovereign, and here came the parting of the ways in Islam between
              spiritual and political interests, and out of thi: arises the difficulty of dealing
              with Moslem affairs from the inside as well as from the outside. </p>
            <p>The idealist in the Pan-Islamic movement seeks to bring about greater unity among
              Moslems on spiritual lines only; the Egyptian Nationalist declares that he has no wish
              to submit himself and his country to Turkish maladministration ; both agree in looking
              for light and leading to Constantinople. But to differentiate between spiritual and
              temporal interests is to militate against the primitive conception and fundargental
              characteristics of Islam. To set up a spiritual authority pure and simple is without
              precedent and has the whole weight and force of history against it. An exception to
              this might be cited in the case of the so-called second dynasty of the Abbassides (not
              generally accepted by Moslems as true Khalifas) who, from 1258 to 1517 of the common
              era, enjoyed only a nominal religious authority under the Mamelukes in Egypt. It is
              often the boast of the Moslem that "Islam has no priesthood"; it can therefore have no
              high-priest. On the other hand it is quite certain that the average Muslem cannot
              conceive of a Khalifa except as an absolute leader in all things, nor does he value
              the importance of any subject, especially in his dealings with the "infidel," except
              in so far as it relates to the faith </p>
            <p>Now according to the Ashariya, or orthodox school, every candidate for the office of
              Imam must be of the tribe of the Quraish and be duly elected by the consent of the
              people. In neither of these points is the Sultan of Turkey qualified, and so the
              quotation given by your correspondent, Mr. Cheetham, "the Sultan cannot be regarded as
              the true Khalifa;" taken (literally, is correct. But there is another principle well
              recognised in Islam, which is, that when the Imamate has been usurped by a per-on not
              possessing all the necessary quali fications, if his rule be just and in accordance
              with the teachings of the Koran and the traditions, it is better to acquiesce and
              submit. Moreover, the Sultan, holding as he does the positions of ruler of the only
              Moslem state of first class importance and of protector of the holy places, and having
              in his hands the appointment of the Sherif of Mecca (the most Bacred post in Islam),
              can claim to be de facto the only possible Khalifa and defender of the faith. </p>
            <p>Such then to-day is the chaotic state of I thought and belief in the Moslem world on
              the question of the Khalifate. Whether the idealists can ever succeed in
              spiritualising the deep sense of brotherhood in Islam : whether the masses can ever
              rise above that feeling of the necessity of a titular head (the same sense which
              created the Pope and made him infallible), and whether such a leader, once possessed
              of the full confidence of the followers of the, faith would rest content with
              spiritual authority only,are deep questions and form tuo big a subject to be discussed
              in a letter of this Vind. They are however full of interest and of no little
              importance.--Yours, etc. </p>

            <head>The Money Market,</head>
            <p>The money market remains in very much the same condition, with a bright outlook, but
              with no lower rates or prospect of a change 1 in the Bank rate for some time. Things
              in America are in the seething pot for the present, and everybody is acting, in money
              as in stocks; on the safe side. This is as it should be, and will no doubt be
              productive of greater ease in the spring, which is the most important time of the
              year, when some considerTable flotations are likely to take place. </p>
            <p>The demands of the London County Council will be very considerable, but with the
              more', conservative administration it is probable &amp; there will be no difficulty in
              arranging for their requirements on satisfactory terms. 1 Surprise is still expressed
              that larger amounts of gold do not come from Egypt, and there is much speculation as
              to the quantity you will be able to retain of the eight to nine millions i you have
              received from this side. | </p>
            <p>The Bank return is again somewhat colouriess. The stock of gold and bullion is lower
              by £641,000, notwithstanding that only £99,000|1 on balance went abroad, this
              shrinkage being 1 due to the usual outflow of currency incidental to the turn of the
              month. The note circulation | has expanded, by £244,000, and the total reserve is'
              £885,000 lower at £26,408,000, 1: which compares with £26,054,000 last year. The ratio
              of reserve to liabilities has fallen 25 to 447 per cent., which is 2 percent below the
              ratio twelve months ago. </p>

            <head>The Stock Markets.</head>
            <p>The frenzied finance which has been characteristic of Wall Street during the past
              week has not merely demoralised the stock markets there, but has also been the
              dominating adverse | factor on the Stock Exchange here. The disorganisation which the
              scare has caused in 1 Throgmorton St. gives a somewhat misleading idea of the extent
              to which London dealers are committed in American stocks and shares. As a matter of
              fact the American speculatives position here was very considerably reduced d. ring the
              shake-out recently, but in the pre-11 sent nervous state of most markets, the | wild
              operations in New York have naturally 11 had the effect of emphasising the weakest
              spoty. The final result of this will, of course, be salutary as regards future
              operations, but brokers are finding it difficult to view the present situation from
              this philosophical standpoint. </p>
            <p>The chief feature of interest for the moments is the Japanese new conversion Five per
              cent. luan, which is to be issued to-night at 994 This would appear to be absurdly
              cheap iu view of the present price of the Four-and-a-la Half per cents. which, even in
              the face of it still stand at 939. Of course the price of the latter are being
              artificially. sustained during th the period of issue of the new loan They lo will no
              doubt fall to the proportionate level as soon as the latest issue is all taken up. Til
              The quotation for the new loan is only 1 percent premium, which would make the 45
              percent. worth only about 90, | </p>
            <p>The overwhelming defeat of the Progressives at the County Council elections has 16
              been received with great satisfaction on the Stock Exchange. The extravagant policy of
              that party had caused grave uneasiness in financial circles for a long time past, and
              it is confidently anticipated that the saner policy to which the new majority have
              committed themselves will do much to revive many enterprises which have suffered much
              from oppressive legislation and continually increasing taxation </p>
            <p>Markets have continued depressed to-day, and.quotations are again generally lower.

            <p>The Japanese new loan is attracting much attention in the foreign market. The new
              issue is for twenty three millions, which will be chiefly devoted to the conversion of

              per cent. cash bonus. A large portion of the issue will be placed in Paris | </p>
            <p>In view of the new loan, the old issues have been offered, the Fours being very flat.
              All the stocks show declines of 1/8 to 1/4 to-day. </p>

              was some recovery, but the North British declaration yesterday gave the market another
              cold douche, and British Deferred slumped 7/8 to 32 7/8, and the Preferred were marked
              down a fall point. Caledonian Preference gave way 1/2. Yesterday Brighton "A" were the
              only bright spot, these registering a gain of 1/2 . </p>
            <p>There has been continued liquidation in this market to-day. Brighton "A" have

            <p>The enormous realisations in New York, which amounted in one day alone to 2,357,000
              shares, have caused prices here to fluctuate violently, and in several cases very low
              levels have been touched. Indeed, the declines in values have been so serious, that
              there is much misgiving as to the ultimate result of the settlement next week. The
              sharp advance in Readings which followed the large purchases of the shares by the
              Harriman clique, who were reported to be desirous of securing control of the line,
              gave some strength to the market for a time, but this has been followed by further
              extensive liquidation. Americans have again been heavily sold to day. Lo isville have
              shed 4, Aitchison 3, Chesapeake 33,Reading 24, Unions -25, and Southern Preference 2.

            <p>The Egyptian market has been quiet, and in several cases shares have been offered,
              but there are few buyers about. This of course applies to the speculative group only.
              National Bank of Egypt fell from 287 to 27 sellers, and Agricultural Bank from 9)

              Debentures keep steady at 90-1. Daira Sanieh Ordinary have been very flat, and have
              been offered down from 165 ex dividend to 15 . before finding a buyer. The Deferred
              are nominally 90, but it is difficult to get a bid. Egyptian Estates are dull at 2 ,
              while Delta Land &amp; Investment are nominally 31-4. New Egyptian are quoted 1-5, but
              there are only sellers at 24/g. United Egyptian Lands are to premium, and the Deferred
              about 9. Khedivial Mail are supposed to be 17d, and Union Foncière are 54-68 without

            <p>Business in the mining market has been on a very reduced scale. A few specialities
              have received attention, and for the most part the tone has been steady, but the
              shares generally have been affected by the depression ruling in other sections of the
              House Dealers are dig. posed to reduce their commitments in view of the differences
              which have to be met at the forthcoming settlement. </p>
            <p>Yesterday Kaffirs, after being dull during the day, took a sharp turn for the better
              in the Street, and Rand Mines recovered from 67 to Gid, while East Rands and
              Goldfields were in demand at 4 de and 4. : The tone in Kaffirs to-day has been rather
              more favourable. Raud Mines and Gold Fields are each to better. </p>
            <p>Egyptian mining shares have again had a very quiet week, and the changes are confined

          <head>RHEUMATISM'S CAUSE.</head>
          <p>A Disorder of the Blood. This Lady was quite a Cripple. Pain in every joint. </p>
          <p>Cured by the Rich New Blood Plentifully Made by </p>
          <p>DR. WILLIAMS PINK PILLS </p>
          <p>The fault of the Blood -- that is the direct cause of Rheumatism in every form; and as
            the disease proceeds from the blood the only way to a cure is by renewing the blood
            supply That is why Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are so eminently successful
            in Rheumatism and other blood disorders, because they actually make strong red blood
            that cleanses the system of positions and builds up health k anew with full relief from
            pain. 1. " All my joints were inflamed with Rheu tematism four years ago," said Mrs.
            Burdin, ol 7 50, Archdeacon-lane, Leicester, when interview ned recently, "and from a
            strong active woman I dwindled away to a pitiable wreck <hi rend="bold">THESE WERE </hi>
            unable to do anything in the <hi rend="bold">HER SYMPTOMS</hi>. house. What I suffered
            will be partly understood when I tell you that agonising pains flew through my back and
            limb | as though my muscles were gripped by pincers, while an icy feeling crept down my
            spine. My flesh and bones became sore, and I felt as though I had been beaten all over.
            "Every change in the weather set up fresh attacks and increased my pain. Sometimes I
            could hardly drag one foot after the other, and " in time I became quite a cripple. Then
            rheumatic fever developed, and I had to take to my bed, where for fourteen weeks I lay
            in Jagony, Every movement of my body caused excruciating pains to shoot through me ; my
            body twitched with agony, for it seemed as though I was being stabbed with red-hot
            needles. |"My fingers became knotted and my skin puffed ; also, my flesh was so tender
            that I I could not bear the weight of the bed clothes, and I had to have supports to
            save them from touching me. My breathing became short and sharp, and my heart
            palpitated. I grew as weak and helpless as a child, and terribly emaciated, with my
            nerves in such a bad state that I could not stand the daylight, and the room was kept
            darkened. "In spite of all the clever treatment of doctors I seemed to get worse ; the
            medicine they gave me produced nausea, without relieving my agony. " But at this time my
            husband was strongly advised to give me Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People, and
            though-I fully believed I was beyond cure, I consented to try the pills. After a steady
            course of the pills I was pleased to notice a decided improvement: I continued, and the
            pains began surely to diminish ; before long I could move my hands. *This encouraged me
            so much that I persevered with Dr. Williams' Pink Pills; then my strength returned until
            I was able to sit up in bed ; I began to put on flesh; I gradually regained the use of
            my limbs, and was able to venture out of bed. ** From the time I began Dr. Williams'
            Pink Pills I never looked back; they alone restored me from a hopeless cripple to the
            strong, healthy woman you now see. I am quite free from all pains of Rheumatism and well
            able to attend to my domestic duties. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are truly a wonderful
            medicine, and I cannot praise them too much, for I consider they saved my life." By
            supplying Red, Good Blood that fortifies the system and drives out all the poisons |
            that set up Rheumatism, innumerable cures have been achieved by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
            for Pale People, which have also cured Anemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Sciatica, St. Vitus
            Dance, Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy. Sold at shops (but
            avoid substitutes and take care that the full name, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
            People, is on every package). Sold by all chemists and dr 'ggists at P.T. 18 the box and
