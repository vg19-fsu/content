                    <head>THE AGRICULTURAL SHOW.</head>
                    <p>We learn that it is proposed henceforth to hold tho Agricultural Show at
                        Cairo biennially iiuhad of annually, and the out Show girea bp the Khedirial
                        Agricultural Society et Gheeireh will take place ,in the spring of 1907. It
                        is felt the headquarters of the K.A.S. that the annual agricultural shows
                        done their work of educating the cultivators; the days are past when the
                        native farmrs assumed that had seen the last of is cow when sent it to
                        compete and the majority of exhibitors soonted the idea that they would ever
                        see the prises offered except in the society's noticea. The oaltivator has
                        now fall confidence in the integrity of the Agrioaltnral Sooiety and in the
                        jastice of its awards, be has also learned to apply to it for assistance
                        against inseot pests and for advice as to the proper methods of cultivation;
                        and the formation of provincial branches of the society with agricultural
                        experts as secretaries, which has been began, will, in course of time,
                        furnish eeoh moadirieh with a centre to which all oan apply for advice and
                        for certain forms of assistance. It is an open secret that the work at
                        headquarters has often been made unduly heavy by the neoessity of holding
                        yearly shows, and it is now proposal to hold provinoial exhibitions in
                        alternate years. Mansoarah and the Fayoam set the example this year. In 1906
                        one exhibition will be bald in Lower and one in Upper Egypt, and to judge
                        from the success of this year's exhibitions, both shoald be largely attended
                        and have valuable educational results. It may be argued that these results
                        will be equalty well scoured oy an exhibition at Ghezireh, but this
                        contention does not allow for the foot that large numbers of the smaller
                        proprietors do not and oannot visit the Cairo shows, and that it is
                        precisely this class which the Khedivial Agricultural Sooiety wishes to
                        interest and to inspire with up-to-date ideas on the subject of cultivation.
                        As to the exhibits of machinery, it is muoh to be regretted that any firms
                        should have found the notice given them of the postponement of the
                        Agricultural Show at Cairo till 1907 too short, but if the matter be
                        considered from a general point of view it will be recognised that the
                        exhibitors of agricultural maohinery will not be the sufferers by the
                        change. 'The very transport of their machines to Cairo and their
                        installation and protection at the exhibitions occupied the time of numerous
                        employesss who could ill be spared, and gave the agents themsleves great
                        trouble, while there was not the same variety in the machines exhibited that
                        would be noticeable in biennial exhibition. </p>

                                tisfied, but the revolutionaries demand further concessions. The
                                revolutionists have proved their control over the masses by
                                countermanding yester- day's demonstration, announcing that they
                                would choose their own day, and not accept one of Trepoff's
                                choosing, for the last fight. M. Witte has not made the least

                                the Liberals show themselves dis- trustful, while the reactionaries

                                carried out despite the efforts of the enemies of reform, but the
                                Government must have the coopera- tion of the pacific majority.

                        <p>—A servant of Abdel Latif Bey Faid was murdered in His master's house
                            Cadabah village, Gharbieh, on the 2nd inst. by some unknown persons. The
                            mur- derers appear to bare first beaten him most savagely and then
                            strangled him, forcing the point of a stick which reached the brain into
                            his skull. Ths Kafr el Zayat authorities have opened an enquiry. Hassan
                            Effendi Faid, the omdeb, and some ghaffirs are suspected of the crime,
                            because, it is said, the omdeh was on bad terms with the murdered man.
                            They have been arrested, but as yet no proof has been advanced of their
                            guilt.</p>

                    <p>The new Grand Mufti, Sheikh Bakri Moha- med Ashour El Sedfi, has entered
                        immediately on his new post. He is a well-known personality among the Moslem
                        religious notables and a follower of the Hanafi rite. He was educated at Al
                        Azhar, where he became ulema after showing considerable theological
                        proficiency, and was for a long period Mufti to the now suppressed
                        Beit-el-Mal Administration. He was later appointed to the Mehkemeh High
                        Court as Cadi and showed such legal and theological acumen that he gained
                        the good opinion of the bulk of Egyptian Moslems. He was acting as Grand
                        Cadi in the place of Sheikh Yehia, who has gone on an important errand to
                        Constantinople, when the death of Sheikh Abdul Kader El Raffei threw open to
                        him the Grand Muftiship of Egypt. One of our Cairo contemporaries states
                        that the Ministry of Jnstice is at present discussing the question whether
                        the new Grand Mufti can still perform his functions of Grand Cadi per
                        interim, or whether some one else must be appointed to replace Sheikh Yehia
                        during his absence in Turkey.</p>

                    <p>We cull the following from a New York contemponry :— The extraordinary case
                        of Mollie Katain who was married last July to Harry Liederer, No. 170
                        Delancey street taken by him to Egypt sold as a white slave into bondage,
                        and rescued by the efforts of the International Society for the Suppression
                        of the White Slave Trade, has just come to light through a letter sent by
                        the girl to her brothers in New York. Her courtship was a short one, and she
                        was married at her home, No. 132, Attorney street last July. Four weeks
                        later she disappeared and was not heard of until last weak, when the society
                        sent her to her brothers after they had rescued her. Her introduction to
                        Lederer, it was said, was brought about by Mrs. Nathan Weber, who lives at
                        No. 122, Suffolk street She had $300 in bank in her own name and this must
                        have been, withdrawn without her knowledge, for in her letter she asks that
                        her fare home may be paid out of this money. The letter to her brothers is
                        in her own handwriting and is as follows: "My Dear Brothers—I am unable to
                        express the sad position in which I find myself My husband has been
                        treacherous and has fooled me all along. He brought me to Alexandria and has
                        made me a prisoner of other men. I wish you to go to court and get
                        duplicates of the documents which show that I am his wife, as he has stolen
                        the original papers from me. Buy a ticket for me to return, for he has taken
                        all my money from me. Iam very sick and cannot write much more. Molfie."

                    <head>THE PHARMACY REGULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>We mentioned in our issue of the 16th ultimo two serious infringements of the
                        new pharmacy regulations which come into ope- ration about a year ago. These
                        prove how necessary it is for the Sanitary Adminis- tration to use the
                        utmost vigilance for safe- guarding the public. In one case a Greek named
                        Pistis, when applying for permission to open a pharmacy, sent in a diploma
                        that was ascertained to have belonged to a man who had been dead since 1896!
                        In the other case three individuals sent in diplomas pur- porting to have
                        been issued by the Faculty of Medicine of Athens bat which, when subjected
                        to expert examination, were found to be forged. The officials of the
                        Department, since the new regulations came into operation, have taken in
                        hand the inspection of pharmacies but it seems they are greatly hampered by
                        the action of the Tribunals, who, when clear cases of irregularities are
                        brought to their notice, inflict such a ridioulously small punish- ment that
                        it cannot possibly act as a de- terrent. Recently, we are informed, at Man-
                        sourah, two individuals, one a Greek and the other an Italian, were summoned
                        for keeping a pharmacy open for three months without a certificated chemist.
                        The Tribunal Mixte de Contravention inflicted for this grave offence the
                        minimum fine of P.T. 5 in one case and P.T. 10 in the other!</p>

                    <p>The New Khedivial Hotel at Alexandria, which is at present being entirely
                        renovated, will be quite ready for occupation again by the coming Christmas.
                        It will, when completed, contain altogether 150 bedrooms and twenty suites
                        of special apartments fitted with bath- rooms, closets, and other
                        accommodation. The grill-room will be open on the 1st December, and
                        afternoon teas will be served in the new pavilion on the terrace. A fine
                        Tzigane band has been specially engaged for the hotel and will play three
                        times a day. A special feature of the hotel will be the residential
                        apartments for bachelors and fami- lies, who will be able to live at the
                        hotel at an inclusive and moderate cost for board and lodging.It is expected
                        that this innovation will be taken full advantage of, and owing to the poor
                        restaurants and high rents at Alexandria such accommodation will be a great
                        advantage to residents. Another special feature of the hotel will be the
                        cooking.The leading "chef" at the Metro- pole Hotel, Moote Carlo, has been
                        engaged, and arrived on Sunday last with an entire brigade of gastronomic
                        artists selected with the utmost care from among the leading European hotels
                        and restaurants. During the winter the Khedivial Hotel management will give
                        a ball once a fortnight, as is the custom in Cairo. There is to be a grand
                        "Reveillon" at the hotel at Christmas, which will be the formal opening fete
                        of the hotel. Every night when there is a performance at the Zizinia Theatre
                        there will be a special supper menu at a fixed inclusive price, and a band
                        will play from midnight until 2 p.m. A large American bar is to be opened on
                        December 1, which will be equal to the finest bar in Egypt. The hotel is
                        under the manage- ment of Mr. E. Fleury, late manager of the Nonvel Hotel at

                    <p>At the recent land sale at Rodah, according to 'Le Progres," Dr. Nimr bade
                        L.E. 2,470 per feddan for the Menekley estate and this was the highest bid.
                        But owing to a dispute as to the validity of the bid it is possible that
                        Maitre Carton de Wiart's offer on behalf of an English group rail hold good.
                        The ques- tion will be decided at the next meeting of the Superior Council

                        This ia said to be the first English company founded in Egypt, and owing to
                        its good management we are sure that the shareholders will be pleased-to
                        hear that the capital is to be increased so that the company may be able to
                        develop its business throughout Egypt and the Sudan. The board of directors
                        will henceforth be in Cairo, with only two directors in London. The company
                        will remain an English company and the meetings will be held in London.</p>

                    <p>One of the wealthiest families at Assiout is the Khaehabah family, writes our
                        Assiout Correspondent. They had four large houses at Assiout. One was burnt
                        down four months ago, another two months ago, and the remaining two last
                        week. The fire broke out at 11 p.m. and in aboat two hours, the two houses
                        were a blazing mass. The loss is estimated at £8,000. It is a remarkable
                        coin- cidence that in all three cases the cause of this outbreak was
                        accidental. Our correspondent states that Assiout. is very badly supplied
                        with pumps. In the fire mentioned the house was burning for a whole hour
                        before the pumps arrived, and after they came it took another hour to put
                        them in working order. Thanks are due to Mr. Russell, the Interior
                        inspector, who worked hard all night, as on the previous occasions.</p>

                        Les nouvelles actions sont donc souscrites a moins de 115 francs, car depuis
                        de nombreuses annees deja, le dividende du "Banco di Roma" eat consolide a
                        fr. 7; ce qui vent dire que ces actions presentent le rare avantage d'un

                    <p>Mr. H.E Garle again writes to the "Times" with references to the above, as
                        follows: Sir,—May I, in view of the references to this matter in your issue
                        of the 23td inst., again trespass upon your space. The proceedings in
                        question had nothing whatever to do with the trial of the action and the
                        merits of the question were not even gone into. The next-of-kin's legal
                        adviser in Egypt was of opinion that, in all the circumstances, the Egyptian
                        Courts should be asked to restrain any payment of the surplus in the hands
                        of the Daira Sanieh Limited to the Egyptian Govern- ment; and this is all
                        that was done, and is all that has failed The next-of-kin's main claim is
                        against the Egyptian Government and tho Daira Sanieh of H.H. the Khedive ;
                        it has not been tried, and will not be tried for some time to come. The
                        proceedings that have taken-place are in truth, little more than the
                        equivalent to a stop order in this country, and even so, are being appealed
                        against. I earnestly trust that you will see your way to give the same
                        prominence to this letter that you did to my last, for it is even more impor
                        tant that your statement in your issue of the 23rd inst. be answered than
