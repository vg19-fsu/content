                            Friday last, on which day the police cart was there both morning and
                            afternoon. An Englishman was driving with an Arab by his side while two
                            other men, one a Greek, the other an Arab, were in the cart An invalid
                            German lady resident was standing at the door of her house watching her
                            little dog, who was being given a short run and within call, when the
                            dog was lassoed by the two men and put in tho cart. The lady cried out,
                            and although unable to do much, tried to stop the cart and recover her
                            pet. The driver whipped up his horses and she was thrown the ground.
                            However, she got up and bold the bridle of one horse. Again the driver
                            used his whip and the plucky lady was hit across the hands. Ultimately
                            she succeeded in recovering the dog. The animal had been fully under her
                            control, and the action of the police was quite unjustifiable." </p>

                    <p>Lord Cromer's annual Report on Egypt and the Sudan, which has been published,
                        is of great' interest. He dwells on the necessity of modifying the regime of
                        the Capitulations, more especially in the direction of devising an improved
                        scheme for legislation where Europeans are concerned. </p>
                    <p>He alludes to the rapid growth of the Sudan revenue, and points out that,
                        exclusive of capital expenditure, the cost of the Sudan to Egypt in 1904
                        only amounted to LE. 27,000. He states that the attitude of the Khedive has
                        contributed to establish the most friendly relations between tho British and
                        Egyptian portions of the Administration, and speaks in complimentary terms

                        system by running regular steamers between Naples and Alexandria. The same
                        company is building a magnificent sanatorium-yacht at Hamburg. The boat is
                        to be called the ''Furst Bismarck," the liner of that name having been sold
                        to the Russians. The steamer will visit Alexandria several times daring the
                        coarse of the season. She will carry a staff of ten or twelve physicians,
                        under the direction of Prof. Schweninger, medical adviser and confidante of
                        Prince Bismarck. The company may open some hotels in Egypt, but on this
                        point nothing has yet been decided. It is however certain that their offices
                        near the Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo, will be greatly enlarged, and that
                        new offices will be established at Alexandria and Port Said. Mr. Ernest
                        Stangen, general manager of the tourist department of the Hamburg-Amerika
                        Line, is expected to arrive shortly. </p>

                    <head>MURDER IN CAIRO. </head>
                    <p>A cold-blooded murder was committed in Cairo on Sunday morning. About 8.30
                        a.m., as M. Egidio Gerosa, aged about 25, was on the point of entering the
                        Catholic Church it the Mousky, ho received two shots in the back from the
                        gun. He was immediately removed to the caracol in Ataba Khadra square, but
                        shortly afterwards expired from the wounds he had received. </p>
                    <p>The murderer was arrested by the police men on duty outside the church, and
                        was conveyed without showing any resistance to the samo caracol. The man's
                        name is Fabio Ninci, and, like his victim, is of Italian nationality. It
                        appears that he had some time ago been discharged from the service of tho
                        Telephone Company, where he was employed as a wires-man. This discharge ho
                        attributed toM.Gerosa, who was an electrician of the company, and it was to
                        avenge himself that he had committed the deed. An enquiry has been opened by
                        the Italian consular authorities in Cairo ; meantime, the murderer has been
                        incarcerated in the central native prison. He will be sent to Ancona for
                        trial Yesterday afternoon, at 4 o'olock, the funeral of the victim took
                        place from the Italian Hospital At Abbassieh. The Italian Consul and
                        Vicennial, Mr. StevensoD, manager, and the rest of the personnel of the
                        Telephone Company were amongst the five hundred persons who formed tho
                        funeral cortege. Great sympathy was evinced for the unfortunate engineer,
                        and the funeral service at 8t Joseph's Church,Ismailia,was largely attended.
                        The interment took place at the Catbolic Cemetery. It is rumoured that M.
                        Gerosa's death the result of a plot among the workmen discharged by the
                        Telephone Company, some of whom are said to be Anarchists,but- this rumour

                    <p>Yesterday, a large number of the members of Alexandria Archeological Society,
                        accompanied by their families and a few invited friends, in all numbering
                        probably over 150, took part in the first exouraion of the season arranged
                        by the committee of the society. Alonkir was the chosen destination, and an
                        inspection of the tesselated pavements of the supposed temple of Canopis,
                        prior to their removal to the Alexandria Museum, the object of the visit.
                        Special arrangements were made for the conveyance of the party by the 4.10
                        afternoon train from Sidi Gaber, and on the completion of the journey the
                        train drew up on the line at the spot nearest to the Hike. This was a little
                        awkward for the ladies and children, who found some difficulty in alighting
                        from the carriages, but it was soon overcome by the help of their male
                        companions. The afternoon was fine, and the heat was tempered by a cool
                        breeze, rendering the walk through the fields of barley—which was in process
                        of harvesting—a pleasant one. Arrived at the site of the temple, the company
                        grouped themselves around a stone from which Dt,_ Breccia gave a short
                        lectors descriptive of the history of the rains as far as it is known or can
                        be conjectured. A great deal on this subject has already appeared in our
                        columns, and only in the early part of this year we called attention to the
                        necessity of steps being taken for the preservation of these interesting
                        tessalated pavements. After the lecture and an inspection of the pavements
                        and the The few granite columns visible, the company wended their way to
                        Kharabia, where Prince Omar Toussonn had very kindly erected a tent, in
                        which refresh meats were served, and greatly appreciated after the long and
                        tiring walk. Before leaving the tent Mr. Ralli, as president of the
                        Archeological Society, thanked Prince Omar Toussoun for his kindness in
                        affording the party the facilities he had given, and Dr. Schiesa, on the
                        part of the Alexandria Musuem, thanked Dr. Breooia for his interesting
                        speech. A number of very interesting ratios were on view in some
                        outbuildings of Prince Toussoun, and after inspecting these the company
                        proceeded to Khabara station, whére they entrained at 7.30 for Alexandria.
                        We may mention, as being in the party, Yacoub Pasha Artin, Sir Gerald

                        think so. The man who "kept the flag flying" is not the one to give anything
                        away even to Kaisers. At the same time it is questionable taste even in

                        to time the subscribers will be doubled and trebled soon and a larger
                        concert hall will have to be provided. We hear, however, that the new hall
                        kindly provided by M. Aghion behind the French Consulate, is much more
                        spacious than the University's lecture hall and also better ventilated. For
                        want of space the choruses sung by the pupils were given in a room behind
                        tho platform, the door between being left open. The effect was a very
                        pleasing one and the choruses (a) Serenata Napoli tana, (b) Barcarole, by
                        Dénia, were sung with ''attack'' and precision, the lights and.shades being
                        well attended to. A young tenor, M. Papanti, sang, "Aprite," by Toeti, with
                        expression and great tunefulness, and his voice has a future fa store tor
                        him. The two pianoforte pupils were quite Aon de ligne. Miss Giglio's
                        classical appreciation of her part in the Beethoven Quartott, fa which the
                        was supported by the profwsors of the Conservatoire, Messrs. Lama, Cuirlo
                        and Romeo, being remarkable for its thoughtfulness and good taste. Mile.
                        Levi, too, absolutely astonished her audience by her brilliant passage
                        playing in Lizst's Rhapsodie No. XIa. Mlle. Vente kindly took port in the
                        programme and delighted everyone by the tinging of two songs, "Le Saüs," by
                        Olagnier, and a charming romance written by the director artistique of the
                        Conservatoire Professor Colella. Both songs were sung with great expression,
                        and Mile. Verita's voice has in our opinion greatly improved in timbre and
                        reserve since we have had the pleasure of hearing her. Last, but very far
                        from least, came Mendelssohn's splendid Serenata, played famously well by
                        Professor Colella, and he was accompanied by a small orchestra under the
                        baton of Mr. Gianni Galletti, who also accompanied all the songs. We were
                        glad to hear that during the concert the vice president, Lady Blomfield1 was
                        promised £25 by a generous music-lover, who heard she was in need of funds
                        to purchase a few instruments necessary for the orchestra now being formed.
                        The organizers of the " Pavane, " i.e, the representation given for the
                        Enfants trouvés at the Zizinia, have kindly promised to repeat their
                        performance at popular prices in aid of the funds of the University and the
                        Conseratoire </p>
