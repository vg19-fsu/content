                    <head>THE POWER OF KINGS.</head>
                    <p>In the September number of the "Empire Review" Mr. Edward Dicey points out
                        that the Friendrichsof interview illustrates a change in European public
                        opinion, which can hardly have failed to attract the notice of all thoughful
                        students of European politics. Rather more than half a century ago, he says,
                        constitutional government under parliamentary institution was regarded as a
                        sort of panacea for all mundane evils, and as a corollary to this belief
                        monarchies were denounced as effete institutions, only to be tolerated by
                        thinking beings on condition of the monarchs of becoming mere figure-heads
                        of the sovereign people. "What I wish to show is that the belief in the
                        early disappearnce of monarchies, and the reduction of monarch to a
                        subordinance psition, has been absolutely falsified by the events of the
                        last half century. Kings are not only as numerous as ever in this old world
                        of Europe but they are individually more powerful. The politicans of the
                        Bright and Cobden era wer right in supposing that before the nineteeth
                        century had passed away the democracy would have come to the front; they
                        were wrong in assuming that the democracy would necessarily become more and
                        more enamoured of parlimentary institutions. The contrary has proved to be
                        case. In the contarry has proved to be the case. In the old world, at any
                        rate, the ideal of the democracy has shown itself to be One Man Government,
                        and in all monarchila countires the one man, more than not, is the monarch.
                        In England, in Germany, in Belgium, in Holland, in Spain, in Portugal, in
                        Italy, in Austria, in Sweden and Norway, in Roumania, and even in the Balkan
                        States the reigning sovereign holds a personal influence and authority
                        superior to that of his minsiters or his parlimanets. Russia and turkey are
                        both One Man Governements. But no one conversant with either of these two
                        countries can doubt that Sultan, Abdul Hamid, is regarded by his people as
                        the vice-regent of God on earth; and that Czar, Nicolas II., however
                        uncertain his tenture of power may be is still the most effective - or at
                        any rate the least ineffective - personality in the Sclav Empire.</p>

                            <p>The publication of Prince Hohelohe's diary has produced an
                                indescribable sensation throughout the country. It is regarded as a
                                colossal indiscretion. The details relating to living rulers and
                                statesmen are considered as justifying the Emperor's anger and going
                                to prove that the publication was unauthorised. Writing in 1880, the
                                Prince describes the Emperor as a boyish and inconsiderate young man
                                of whom his mother is afraid and who quarrles with his father. The
                                diary displays the Bismarks in the harehest light.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the Emperor Frederick, it describes the Empress
                                Frederick, in 1888, weeping because of the disgraceful behaviour of
                                certain people who said that Herbert Bismarck had the imprudence to
                                tell the Prince of Wales that Freerick was incapable of ruling.
                                Whereupon the Prince of Wales said that he would have thrown Herbert
                                out of the room but for the imporatnce which was attached to
                                retaining good relations between Great Britiain and Germany. The
                                Prince of Wales said to Prince Hohenlobe that he was disgusted at
                                the boorishness of the Bismarcks and could not comprehend a policy
                                of irritating France.</p>
                            <p>The Prince recalls a conversation which he had with the Tear in I-96.
                                The Tsar said that the chief task of his policy was in the Far East.
                                The Japanese had no money and would take years to complete their
                                armaments, and by then the Siberian Railway would be ready and
                                Russia would be prepared for any eventuality. Replying to the
                                Prince's remark that Great Britian was anxious to secure the
                                supremacy in Africa because she was afraid of losing India, the Tsar
                                said: "Who's going to take India! We are not so stupid as to pursue
                                such schemes." (Reuter)</p>

                                and the attempt on his life by a fanatic. He said: "In spite of the

                                Japanese. Everything I saw in Jpapan greatly impressedme. I was
                                struck by the great orderliness, activity, and intelligence of the
                                population. But my sympathy did not prevent me from acting against
                                the Japanese when they sought to go too far." (Reuter)</p>

                        I felt very gratified the other day to hear his Excellency the Vali express
                        his satisfaction at the largeness of the number of Egyptian that have come
                        this summer, and at the fact of his being told that most of them were
                        returning home with far better health and generally well pleased with their
                        journ; all of which augurs wll fro the progressive increase of the number of
                        Egyptian health seekers in the future. Our Egyptian friends should,
                        therefore, have no more any hesitation about coming to their sister land
                        Syria, and, indeed, instead of harbouring any of the old tears regarding
                        difficulties of admission into the country from the part of the lcoal
                        authorities, they should realize that the latter welcome them with a true
                        spirit of enlightened brotherhood, and hospitality.</p>

                    <head>A FATAL FALL.<lb/>SAPPER KILLED AT RAS-EL-TIN.</head>
                    <p>Sapper Thomas Dixon, R.E., of Ras-el-Tin, was killed early yesterday morning
                        by a fall form the cliff below the British military hospital. According to
                        the evidence produced at the inquest, Dixon, who belonged to "D" block, was
                        sleeping the night in the R.A.M.C. barrack room, and between on and two
                        o'clock yesterday morning, had risen and gone outside the building, and had
                        while at the edge of the cliff, lost his balance and rolled down the slope,
                        falling a perpendicular height of fifteen feet, head foremost, on to the
                        rocks below.</p>
                    <p>The acciden is easily explained by the nature of the ground. An unprotected
                        oradway shirts the wall of the hospital on the northern side, the rampart
                        having first a steep slope of fifteen feet at an angle of 50, and then a
                        sheer drop to the sandstone rock below of another fifteen feet. Sapper Dixon
                        had reached the edge, and slipping backwards off a wooden border at the top
                        of the slope, had rolled down it; a groover and a gap in the slope showing
                        the direction of his fatal decent.</p>
                    <p>Dixon was first missed the enxt morning, when Block "D" wired to enquire for
                        him, whereupon a search was made, and the body was found, hunddled up, on
                        the rocks.</p>
                    <p>An inquest was held at the hospital yesterday afternoon by Mr. Gould, H. B.
                        M's. Consul General, with a jury of three, Messrs, Mun Gavin. Kirby and
                        Whitfield. Private P. J. Lannon, R.A.M.C., stationed at Rus el Tin, stated
                        that he last saw Dixon at 8.30 on Thursday night, when he left decreased in
                        the cateen. Yesterday morning, between ten and half past, when the report of
                        Dixon being missing arrived, Lannon, accompanied by two privvates, both name
                        dWalsh, one being in the Dublin Fusiliers and the other in the R.A.M.C.,
                        went out to look for him, going first along the cliff and then on the rocks
                        below, where they found him with his head bent under hi,. They immediately
                        reported the matter to headquarters.</p>
                    <p>Private Peter WAlsh, R.A.M.C., in his evidence, corroborated all that Lannon
                        had said, adding that between ten and half-ast on Thursday night he saw
                        Dixon sleeping on a spare bed in the R.A.M.C. barrack room, near the door,
                        which was not his regular place of sleeping.</p>
                    <p>Private John Mathison, 1st BAtatlino, R.D.F., stated that he last saw
                        deceased between one and two o'clock yesterday morning, when Dixion, who was
                        lying next to hi, got up. Mathison spoke to Dixon, who appeared to be quite
                        sober, and said he was going out. Twenty mintues eslapsed but Dixon did not
                        return, and Mathison feel asleep again. At four o'clock, he was roused by
                        the native driver of the transport, and saw that Dixon's bed was empty,
                        except for his cost and cap. However, as he had to transport rations to
                        Mustapha, he had no time then to enquire for Dixion, who was still missing
                        when he returned from Mustapha, at 8 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>Major Arthur C. Fox, R.A.M.C. o, stationed at Alexandria, stated that he
                        found deceased lying in a semi prine postion , on his right side; his head
                        was doubled up under his body, and resting on a rock; his right arm
                        underneath him, and his left arm thrust out straight. His legs were
                        separated. His body was in a semi nude condition; he had no jacket and his
                        belt was lying at the side of him. From the position of the body and the
                        nature of the injuries death must have been instanteanoues, and from the
                        position of his neck, this must have been broken.</p>
                    <p>A verdict of Accidental Death was returned.</p>

                    <p>An imporant features of the Church Congress held at Barrow was the discussion
                        on the literary and historical ciriticsm of the Old and New Testaments, and
                        Professor Flinders Petrie's paper dealing with the Bible and the evidence of
                        the inscriptions.</p>
                    <p>Professors Petrie began wit the latest period, and went back to the ages
                        which were more remotes and obsecure. The curious settlement of the Jews in
                        Egypt in consequences of the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, and the
                        building of a temple there by the high priest Oniass IV., had long been a
                        matter of historical debate. This year the site of the town had been found,
                        at Tell el Yehodiyeh , 20 miles north of Cairo; and the foudnation of the
                        temple there showed that it was about half the size of Soloman's Temple, a
                        span for each cubit of the older dimesnison. This was probably the site of
                        the temple of Zerubbabel, from which it was copied. In every respect the
                        accounts given by Josephus were in accord with remains, and his apparent
                        discrepancies were now explained. The beginning of this Jewish occupation of
                        the east of the Delta was seen in the flight into Egypt from Nebuchadnezzar,
                        when all the remant of Judah, the captains of the forces, and the Royal
                        family went to live at Taphaes, now Feenneh. about 30 miles south of Port
                        Said. There might been seen "Pharaoh's house," which Jeremish mentioned, and
                        the pavement which was before the entry where he buried the stores,
                        prophesying that Nebuchadenzzar would pitch pavilion upon it Coming to the
                        period of the Kings of Judah, the early date of Turhaka's campaing (701
                        B.C.) had long been an hisotrical difficulty. But we now know that he was
                        acting in the Delta, probably as Regent of the Ethipian King, for nine years
                        before his own sole reign in 693 B.C. Hence it was natural that while
                        Vicerory he might be called "King" by the Jews, to whom he was the sole
                        representative of the Ethiopian kingdom. A similar difficulty about So, or
                        Sua, King of Egypt, was similarly removed. Of the well-kown Egyptian account
                        of the Judean campaing of Shisak it would seem needless to say anything
                        more; the riot of negation which had tried to emend the name of Shishak into
                        an entirely difficuerent form in order to disconnect it from the campaign of
                        Sheshank, only showed how rabidly unhistorical so-called ciriticism might
                        become. The anonymous Pharaoh, whose daughter was married to Solomon, could
                        not be identified; but the dates would suggest that he was the last - or
                        last but one- of the 21st dynasty of Tanis. These kings had little or no
                        political powr, and securing a retreat into Palestine would be great
                        advantage for them inc ase of trouble with the rivial dynasty at Thebes. In
                        understanding the dark period of the Judges the one cardinal fact was that
                        there was no trace of Egyptian conquest or intrusion into Palestine in the
                        book of Judges. This bound us to place the entry into Cansan after long
                        series of Egyptian conquests and raids, which extended 1590 to 1186 B.C.,
                        the 16th year of Ramessu III. ; or perhaps not later than his eighth year,
                        1194 B.C. Taking the entry in Canaan as after, about 1190 B.C., the exodus
                        must habe been after 1230 B.C. How, then, were we to understand the records
                        of the Judges. It would be found that no judge was stated to have ruled over
                        more than one of the three great divisions - the north, the east of Jordon,
                        and the west - and no head of Saul. On adding the periods stated for the
                        history of each division, we find 118 years for the north, 122 years for the
                        east, and 121 years for the west, practically idential times. It seemed,
                        then, that there wer in the book of Judges the records of the three several
                        divisions of the land, taken in irregular rotation. From the beginning of
                        the reign of Rashoboam in 937 B.C, we have Soloman 977, David 1017, and Saul
                        beginning about 1030 B.C. This placed the beginning of judge hips about 1150
                        B.C., and left 25 years (with a margin of ten years more or less) for the
                        slow conquest of Caan. The number of generations in two priestly genealogies
                        agreed also to this shorters reckoning. We must conclude, then, that the
                        book of Judges was a triple record in contemporaneous sections. Before this
                        age was the great inscripiton of Merenptah, stating that "the people of
                        Israel is laid waste, their crops are not, " in the course of a war in
                        Palestine about 1230 B.C. This period to Israelites having remained in
                        Palestine, or returned there before the general Exodus; and in any case it
                        proved that a "peopleof Israel" were known as early as 1230 B.C. Another
                        result in Sinani had been finding a group of inscriptions in a script which
                        was neigther Egyptian nort Babylonina, but which was not akin to Phoenician.
                        The external evidence pointed to these having been out by native Semitic
                        worken, at about rhee centuries before the Exodus. That the Semitic peoples
                        should have had a share in the collections of sings, which were commonly
                        used around the mediterranean thousands of years before this time, was only
                        to be expected; but it was satisfactory to have some examples of such
                        writing before the Phoenician of the tength century, B.C. A third results
                        form Sinai was the view of Semitic worship there, including burnt offerings
                        on the high place, incense altars, an elaborate system of ablutions inside
                        the temple, and dreaming chambers with Bethel-stones. All of these elements
                        of the Jewish system were thus the common heritage of Semites before the
                        Mossaic reforamtion. Lastly, the civilization and history of the shepherd
                        kings or Hyjsos had been partly brought to light from recent work at Tell el
                        Yehudiyeh. The general results was that these people were pastoral
                        Semites.</p>

                        occupied Egypt; they were warriors and trusted to archery and earthworks for
                        their defence. we could hardly help seeing that Abraham, with his 318 men,
                        was on of the "desert princes" of this migratrion coming down the same line
                        into Egypt at the close of that period. Everything that we could trace about
                        the shepard kings exactly fitted to the type of civilisation that we saw in
                        Abraham, Ishmael, Issac, and Eseu. The genearl result of recent work on the
                        Egyptian side was to enforce the strict historical value of the records of
                        the kingly period, to point to the documentary baiss of the acacount of the
                        Exodus, which was probably re-arranged and enriched by each geneartion of
                        the tribal record keepers and to illustrate the narratives of the great
                        national epic of Genesis.</p>

                    <p>We regret to announce the death of Mr. Bucher Durrer, which occurred a few
                        days ago. The deceased gentlemen was one of the largest hotel proprietors of
                        the world. He was well known both in Switzerland and Northern Italy, where
                        he owned numerous hotels. The new Semiramis at Cairo was one of the deceased
                        gentleman's ventures, and he was also interested in the Excelsior Hotel, now
                        building near the Savoy, Cairo.</p>

                    <head>ENGLISH OPERA IN CAIRO.<lb/>THE BANDMANN VISIT.</head>
                    <p>Our readers will no doubt be glad to hear some details concering our visitors
                        of the Bandmann Opera Company, whom many heard and all heard of last year,
                        and who have come back to give a dozen operattas at CAiro on their way home
                        from the Far East.</p>
                    <p>Many of the same artists and artistes whom we had pelasures in hearing in the
                        spring of 1905 are included in the company. Miss Georgie Corlass is still
                        the leading lady, and Mr. Herry, who visted Cairo a few years ago, is the
                        leading comedian. Mr. Fred. A. Ellis is another comedian of merit who has
                        strenghtened the company. Mr. Mark Lester is back again, and an excellent
                        new baritone, Mr. Ernest Attwall has joined the combination. Miss norah
                        Morrah, here in April 1905, Miss Doreen O'Connor, who ability in soubrette
                        parts is well known, and many others make the Company strong thorughout.</p>
                    <p>The Company since it last performed at Cairo has been all over the East.
                        proceeding from Cairo it visited Bombay, Colombo and CAlcutta, then
                        proceeded to Rangoon and Singapore, Manilla and Hong Kong. Doubling back, it
                        revisited the scenes of its Indian successes, with Singapore and Rangoon and
                        then returing on its tracks reached Shanghai. From Shanghai the Company went
                        up the Yangtse, and for the first time a dramatic company visited Hankow,
                        where the Club became a theatre for the nocen, and all the large BRitish
                        colony turned up. Then came Japan's turn. The Company played at Kobe and
                        Yokohama, meeting with an excellent reception, returned to Manilla and
                        visited Java. The Dutch gave them a splendid reception. Batavia, Surabaya,
                        Samarang and Tokjakata were all delighted by their performance, and the
                        Bandmann Opera Company was the first that crossed the island. Five weeks
                        were spent in Java, where the hispitality and kindness of the Dutch
                        authorities, who allowed the use of excellent theatres at nominal rents,
                        made this interesting departure from the suual route a great success. </p>
                    <p>A new Bandmann company leaves for India this winter, and as Mr. Bandmann has
                        lessed the Theatre Royal at Calcutta and is a director of the New Theatre at
                        Bombay, his companies should become even better known there in the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>As for the repertoire of our visitors, we note several items that are new to
                        Cairo. Among them we may mention Lady Madcap, the Catch of the Season, The
                        Spring Chicken, which so annoyed Mr. Stead, Messeagers' The Little Michus,
                        and Sergeant Brue. Moreover we are to have a peautaomime - Mr. Bandmann's
                        verson of Aladdin, with Mr. Cole as "Mrs. Tawankey," the hero's mother and
                        Miss Corlass as "Aladdin," - which made a great hit at Calcutta.</p>
                    <p>Altogether the dozen performances given at CAiro should meet with success
                        from first to last and be as largely attened as were those at the beginning
                        of April in 1905, when the public regretted that Cairo could not obtain a
                        longer visit from the company.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S FOREIGN TRADE.</head>
                    <p>PREFERENCE FOR CONTINENTAL FIRMS.</p>
                    <p>That a British Government should ever attempt to assist the British
                        manufacturere in any way is a thing not to be hoped for in the best of
                        circumstances. Such being the case, it is useless to expect the Egyptian
                        Government, which is supposed to be directly under the influence of the
                        BRitish Government, to assist the British manufacturer. We do not expect
                        fair play, and we do not get it. The practical effect of "Anglicising" Egypt
                        up to now has been increase the percentage of the trade done by Continental
                        firms in that country to the detriment of our own. We adhere in Egypt to a
                        system of measuremnets which handicapts our maufacturers at every turn; we
                        bind the British manufacturer down by hard and fast specifications, whil
                        alloing his Continental compeitor any amount of latitude in quoting, and we
                        so arrange these specifications as often to make it almost a foregone
                        conclusion that the contract must go to the Continent. All this is extremely
                        unfair, but it is characteristics of the policy of succesive British
                        Governments in encouraging our foreign competitors.</p>
                    <p>It is not, however, of this unfairness that we are complaining at present,
                        but of the stypidity which goes with it, and which, if persisted in, must
                        have the most effect upon Egypt. Our Cairo Correspondent tells us of the
                        decision of the Egyptian Government to admit offically Belgian natural
                        cement in specifications for Government work. Now, Belgian natural cement is
                        not cement at all in the proper sense of the word. By this we mean that the
                        cement which is recognized by the engineers of the world as essential for
                        imporatnt work is of an aritical nature, containg certain definitely
                        specified ingredients which have been sceintifcally treated according to
                        hard and fast rules and subjected to severe tests. The only object in all
                        this very necessary care which is habitually taken in specifiying for sement
                        is to reduce to a minimum the terrible risks entailed by using badly mixed
                        or improperly made cement, the defects of which can only be discovered after
                        the stuff has been used and the damage done.</p>
                    <p>Now, Belgian natural cement is mixed by nature, and the required ingredients
                        may or may not be present. At the best this stuff is absolutely uncertain in
                        quality. Suffice it here to say that all the world over where it has been
                        used it has created for itseld a record of disaster to buldings and loss to
                        users which is absolutely appalling. It would be insult to the understanding
                        of the Egyptian Government to suggest that they are not aware that in the
                        country from which it emanates - Belgium - its use for Government work it
                        absolutely prhibited, as striclty as we prohibit the storing of explosives
                        in the centre of cities. Its inferiority is so throughouly recognizes by
                        those who handle it that the most elaborate means are taken to disguise its
                        identity in foreign countries. These precautions are also dealt with in the
                        aritcle we refer to above. And now this rubbish, which is sold clandestinely
                        elsehwer, with a British label on it to give it a fictitious air of
                        respectability, is admitted openly for use in Egypt. It is placed on a basis
                        of equality with the real and carefully prepared aritlces, and of course, on
                        account of its nature, will underbid it. Such a policy in a country like
                        Egypt, where huge irrigation schemes are the order of the day, and where,
                        consequently, the question of the quality of the cement used, is an unheard
                        of piece of folly. We should like to know on whose advice the Egyptian
                        Government have done this.</p>

                    <p>REUNION OF CHURCHES.</p>
                    <p>At St. Alban's, Holborn, the Very Rev Archimandrite Teknopoulos, who has been
                        sent to England by the Patriarch of Constantinople in order to promote
                        reunion between the Anglican and Greek Churches, has been explaining the
                        similiarity between the scramental theory of the Prayer Book as understood
                        by hum and that of his own Church. Perhap the most intersting feature of the
                        meeting was Prebendary Ingram's statement that he hoped during the coming
                        autumn to celebrate the Eucharists in "the Chapel of the Church of the Holy
                        Sepulchre" at Jerusalem, which was to be placed at the disposal of the
                        Anglican Church by the authorities of the Church. This development certainly
                        deserves the attention of ecclesistical students.</p>

                        Dosetashire Regiment, and artillery and infantry drafts on board for Bombay.

                    <p>The 1st Battalin Dorseshire Regiment - the old 39th of Plassey glory, and
                        whose proud mottom is "Primus in India" (first in India) - is due to embark
                        at Bombay on the S.S. Rewa about the 17th November for home. The battalino
                        has been aborad since 1888 when it for England to Malta. It remained in
                        Malta till the following year when it proceeded to Egypt, its sojourn in the
                        Land of the Pharaohs occupying till 1893. In the latter year it moved to
                        India, and has served in the "The Shiny" since, including a turn on the
                        North West Frontier 1897 by which it gained "Tirah" for the green regimental
                        colours. Since its arrival it served in the Punjab, chieftly, and for the
                        last couple of years was stationed at Fergozpore. It may be interest to ass
                        that we well known regimental motto is derived from the fact that the old
                        39th Regiment of Foot was the first King's regiment as distinguished from
                        the John Company regiments, to arrive in India from Englanf. This it did in
                        1754, and the following year it fought heroically at Plassey, and other of
                        Clive's great vicotires. The motto first appeearred on a drum major's staff
                        presented to the regiment by the Nabob of Arcot in commemoration of the
                        vicotry over Surajan Dowlah. the dorests on arrival home will take over
                        quarters at Gosport.</p>
                    <p>The Army Council has decided to allow the issue of serive rifles to mlitai
                        men during the non-training period, with the view of increasing their
                        musketry efficiency by voluntary pratice. The rifles will be issued to the
                        men at the range, and returned after cleaning at the same place, and placed
                        in the regimental armoury. no expenses will be allowed the men, nor will the
                        voluntary practice relieve them from carrying out the usual annual course of
                        musketry.</p>
                    <p>The present system of promotin to the rank of major-general, though well
                        enough in theory has not given the best results in practice, as an officer's
                        seniority generally depends on the fate on which a vacancy, for which he is
                        specially qualified, occurs. In order to avoid what is a distinct hardship
                        to many, it is suggested that such vacanies should be filled from a
                        permanent establishment of major genearls, and the latter be supplied from a
                        list of the senior selected colonels. The whole system of promotin to
                        general rank is being looked into, it is understood, with a a view to
                        modifying it so as to give the best results.</p>

                        there were sharp, sudden pangs of pain, which nearly brought me down, and
                        these were followed by other symptoms of kidney trouble, eespecially gravel,
                        and great pain in passing water.</p>
                    <p>During pregnancy, the pains were much harder to bear, and just before the
                        birth of my last chlid there was complete stoppage, which alarmed me very
                        much. My limbs swelled up, and my eyesight was affected. I used to get such
                        pains in the head that I hardly knew what to do with myself.</p>
                    <p>Doctors and medicine alike failed to give me any relief, but at last I have
                        found help in Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. They have been a real blessing
                        to me, and I will always say so; nothing has every given me such ease.
                        Doan's Pills have strengthened my back, and have made me feel better in many
                        ways. Indeed, I can truthfully say that by their occasional use I keep in
                        better health than I was for years before.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) Susan Foster,</p>
                    <p>Some months later, Mrs. Foster said: "I was grateful for the good Doan's
                        Pills did me when I told you about it some months ago, but how much more
                        grateful I feel now that I can tell you it is a lasting cure. There has been
                        no return of my serious kidney and bladder disorders since Kidney Pills
                        relieved me.</p>
                    <p>"It is my wish that you make this widely known, so that others suffering as I
                        used to, may know how to get well."</p>
                    <p>Such distressing symptoms as irregular action of the hear, violent, thumping
                        beats, poor circulation of the blood, cold hands and feet, strained
                        breathing, fainitng fits, and dizzy spells, are generally to be traced to
                        the kidneys; seldom is there anything the matter with the heart itself,
                        troubles also will be cured. If, however these disroders are neglected,
                        dropiscal symptoms, such as puffy eyes, and swollen ankles and limbs, will
                        appear, and the body will gradually fill with water.</p>
                    <p>Doan's Kidney Pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists at 13 P.T per
                        box.</p>

                    <p>England and Persia.</p>
                    <p>Russia and this country can now afford to apporach the Persian problem in a
                        more transquil mood than might have been possible a few years ago. The
                        protection of our tarde - which has been seriously prejudiced by the now
                        tariff that Russia imposed upon Persia in 1901 - and the defence of our
                        Indian borders have a course been for many years the cardinal points in our
                        Pesrian policy. They are the cardinal points we must assume, though the
                        menance to our frontier has ceased to be acute for the present. There is
                        practically but one way, short of the hazard of war, in which the great
                        strategical position that we have built upupon our North West Frontier could
                        be seriously endangered. It might be turned by a Russian advance into the
                        Persian province of Seistan, which forms perhaps the only pratical ease for
                        such an operation, and the sourthwards through Persian Baluchi-tan to the
                        Indian Ocean. What we have to do, therefore, is to guard those regions from
                        passing under the Russian control by that process of peaceful penetration in
                        which the Russians have shown themselves to be adepts. </p>

                    <p>Sowing the Wind.</p>
                    <p>The only calculation that appears to underlie both the action and the
                        inaction of the Russian Government would seem to be that anarchy may be
                        allowed to go on checked only by the Government;s own Anarchists, "The Union
                        of Russian Men" - until people are tired of it, and are willing to see the
                        autocracy wide thorugh blood to something like its old position. This notion
                        is sinister enough, and yet it might succeed if the economic and social
                        situation were not so desperate. People will not starve, especially whou
                        they are told day by day that food and land be had for the taking.
                        Unfortunately, the weakness of both parties to the great strife in Russia
                        prolongs the period of anarchy, in which devoted and capable men perish,
                        habits of orderely and peaceful life are forgotten, and bad characters come
                        to the top and exact their price. It is a pity that there is no sign at this
                        stage of the Revolution even of a Russian Mirabeau.</p>

                        having solemnly warned Mr. Stolypin, the Prime Minister, that unless
                        stringent measures are immediately adopted to dimins expenditure, the
                        Russian Empire will be sailing stright towards bankruptcy, and that not far
                        off, either. A Budget deficit of fifteen and a half millions sterling has
                        already come into sight, mainly through the constant increase of outlay on
                        the land forces. Why there should be any commanding occasion for that
                        augmentation of the drain Mr. Kokovatsoff does not venture to conjecture; he
                        confines himself to disclosing the fact. It may be pretty safely surmised,
                        from this reticence, that the persons implicated in the situation are of too
                        exalted position to be brought before the tribual of public opinion. But
                        brishinz all that aside, the European financial world has every cause for
                        serious alarm in the outlook.</p>

                    <p>The Absence of a Leader.</p>
                    <p>The Russian revolutionary movement appears to have collapseed into anarchy
                        and the Government's promised reforms to have merged themselves into
                        ineffectual repression. Even those observers who have most faith in the
                        Russian people, and who are most capable of understanding them, seem to see
                        no issue out of the present distressing consitions except through the
                        revival of the autocratic system. This has from the beginning been seen to
                        be one of the possible endings of the movement, and by no means the least
                        likely one. No leader of the people has come to the front, and it seemed all
                        along probable that without a leader able to combine the partieis of reofrm
                        the popular feeling would waste itself in fruitless and destructive
                        outburts. A reovlutionary by the incapacity of its organisers and by the
                        absense of leaders culminate in the reaction and in the revivial of
                        depostism. But unless depostism finds means of making itself efficient it
                        can but produce a fresh revolutionary movement, a fiercer
                        counter-reaction.</p>

                    <p>The great struggle between liberty and Socialism is bound to come upon all
                        people. At one time it seemed that England would to <cb n="2"/>the country
                        which would last be called upon to make the fateful choice. It was with an
                        indulgent and a detached curiosity that we watched in other lands the
                        advance of subversive doctrines, and flattered ourselves that we were
                        protected by our national common sense, as our shores are protected by the
                        sea from the approach of the foreign peril. Events have moved more rapidly
                        here than in France or in Germany, and it may be that, as we have hitberto
                        led the van of human progress, so we are destined to repel the coming
                        assault on freedom and to destroy the anti-social force which is delusively
                        advertised as Socalism.</p>

                    <p>The Labour Party has gone to work at the wrong end and by the wrong methods.
                        Had it wished to anunex the whole trade union world it should have gone
                        slowly, have contented itself for the time with propaganda, and have
                        carefully refrained from forcing a decision till it could command something
                        like unaminity. People will not be coerced into joing a party, and the
                        miniority who oppose effiation will deeply its being imposed on them unless
                        by an overwhelming majority. Like other men bent on party advantage to the
                        exclusion of more solid interests, the Labour group think more of their
                        immediate victory in securing the adhesion of a great society than of the
                        lasting effect of their action on the prosperity of the movement.</p>

                    <p>The Corps Diplomatique acceredied at Tangier has not failed to recognize the
                        importance of not permitting the Art of Algocirz already signed by the
                        Sultan to remain a dead letter, although so far only three Powers have been
                        able to ratify it. Thus recently, at one of those sittings of which they
                        hold several a month they unamously adopted the folloing resolution: -
                        "Although the ratifisication of the Acre Final of Alegericras has not yet
                        been effected by all the Powers, the Corps Diplomatique are in agreement in
                        declaring that all their members in their relations with the Maghzen must
                        adhere to the principles laid down by the Conference. More particularly in
                        matter concerning public works and concessions no deviation shall be made

                    <p>At a moment when the Yidlidiz "camarilla" and the Sultan himself are
                        secreatly engaged in contriving the disappearance of the princes of the
                        Imperial family, and are bsuily discrediting those of them that have any
                        claims upon the sympathy of Europe, to the end that the realisation of the
                        coup d'etat in favour of Prince Burhaneddin may be rendered more certain, it
                        will not (says the "Manchester Guardian's" Constantinople correspondent be
                        without interest to write a few words concerning a prince who, next to
                        Rashad and Yonsouf izzeddin, has most incurred the displeasure of Abdul
                        Hamid.</p>
                    <p>I refer to prince Medjid, the second son og Abdul Azz born on June 27, 1869.
                        This prince, althouhg, he comes sith in the legal ancession, may in fact be
                        considered as coming third in the roder of sucession, for the princes
                        Suliman, Yshieddin, and Salaheddin, who came between yousouf Izzeddin and
                        Medjid, by their tastes, character, and state of health have little
                        dispoition to rule or are absolutely incapable of diong so.</p>
                    <p>In order to blacken Prince Medjid in the eyes of Europe and of the Turks and
                        yildz "camarilla" are spreading the report that Mejid would prove a dreadful
                        reactionary, violent, fanatical, and pledged body and soul to Germany. This
                        campaign has not been without effect among those who are ignorant of the
                        real opinions and the worth of Medjid Effendi.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, however, though a strict observer of the dictates of his
                        religion, he is perhaps the most liberal of the Turkish Imperial House. He
                        speaks French as perfectly as his mother tongue, and is also well acquainted
                        with German. He has kept his political attitude obscure but then the rightly
                        regards it as imprudent to evince a partiality for this or that Power before
                        he actually comes to the head of the State. His determiantoin and ideal is
                        that Turkey should win the esteem and confidence of Europe. He is in favour
                        of a constitutional regime, and - a rate quality among Oriental princes - he
                        devotes the leisure that his serious studies allow him to the cultivation of
                        the European fine arts.</p>
                    <p>He is subject to the unremitting surveillance of the Sultan, who tinkgs that
                        the disappearance or the discreditng before Turkey and Europe of the Princes
                        Rashad, Youssouf Izzeddin, and Medjid would finally gurantee the success of
                        his contemplated coup d'etat.</p>
                    <p>The authority of the report - notwithstanding the offical denials emanating
                        from the Palace - that the Sultan's ailment is not merely incurable but,
                        according to the diagnoisis of Dr. Bergmann himseld, leaves him only a few
                        months to live has thorwn the advisers of Abdul Hamid into a state of
                        panic.</p>
                    <p>The Yildiz "camarilla" know full well the fate that awaits them if any other
                        than Prince Burhaneddin comes to the throne, and are literally out their
                        minds. Those persons in imeediate attendance on the Sultan who have less
                        courage have made secret prepartions for a flight from Constantinople at the
                        momenet of their master's death; the others who are not disposed to take
                        this course are striving with the courage born of despair , to bring Abdul
                        Hamid to precipitate without delay the comp d'ete in favour of
                        Burhaneddin.</p>
                    <p>As for the group that is plotting to bring a successful issue the combination
                        that consits of causing the Princes Rashad, Youssouf Izzed din, and Medjid

                        <p>THE HEALTH OF ASSOUAN.</p>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir, - Will you kindgly allow me a small sapce in your valuable
                            paper in which to contradict absolutely a statement that has appeared
                            recently in some of your contemporarires to the effect that there is at
                            present an pediemic of influenza in this town.</p>
                        <p>Assouan is quite free from influenza, and that which this correspondent
                            has confounded with influenza is simpoly either a very mild form of
                            dengue fever or a kind of slight fever found in all tropical countries
                            possessing a river which rises and falls as the Nile does. This kind o
                            fever usually lasts from three to five days after which time it passes
                            away without any complications whateve, quite unlike influenza.</p>
                        <p>Whilst on the subject of the health of Assouan, I should like to draw the
                            attention of the Cairo officials of the Public Health Department ot the
                            urgency of having properly filled in the "birket" situated north-east of
                            Assouan. This birket consists of about five acres of s'agnant and
                            foul-smelling water and is proving an excellent breeding place for
                            mosquitoes. The odours from it poison the air, and, unless the matter is
                            seriously taken up, Assouan will be losing something of its well
                            deserved reputation as health resort. </p>
                        <p>Apologizing for taking up so much of your space, I beg to remain yours,
                            etc.,</p>

                        suivant:</p>
                    <p>Les retraits d;or de la Bauque d'Augleterre ont recommence a reprendre a de
                        grandes proportions. Depuis le dernier bilan (26 Septembre) les sorties ont
                        atteint £10,000 pour l'Egypte et le reste pour l;Amerique et diverses autres
                        destinations. Les besoius des Etate-Unis sont, parait-il, loin d'etre
                        satisfaits. La position des Bauques associees de New York s'est toutefois
                        quelque peu ameliorea. Yourjours est-il que le marche de Londres ne se coit
                        pas encore a l'abri de nouvelles saignees de la part de'Amerique et on criot
                        que la Banque d'Angleterre pourrait bien se voir obligee d'elever le taux
                        officiel de l'escompte a 4 ½ pour cent.</p>

                    <p>San nier la relatie, il serait impossible de contester la tenue
                        exceptionnellement bonne de ontre marche aux contrats pendant toute la
                        semaine qui vient de finir: La fermete a regne en plein, et les reactions
                        que nous avons eues pendant les matinees de lundi et de mardi et qui ont ete
                        immediatement suivies de repireses marquees ne sauraient prouver qu'une
                        chose, c'est que notre place n'a pas fait, pour ainsi dire, le moindre des
                        cas de l'Amerique quand elle nour arrivait avec des 30 a 40 points de
                        baisse, tandis qu'elle a accorde toute l'attention voulue aux clotures qui
                        nous veanient en hausse.</p>
                    <p>Cette tactique et cette tenacite ont fini par trouver leur recomperse, car,
                        en comparant la cote d'aujourd'hui a celle de Vendredi dernier, nour
                        trouvours qu'a 17 25/32, le novembre a gane toute bonement la bagtelle de
                        3.4 de tallari. Et ce ne sont n aux avis de deterioration a la recolte, - au
                        contarair, elle ne saurait mieux marhcer - si aux achate de la fiature que
                        nous devons ce resultat, mais unique aux convertures des vendeurs en blanc,
                        qui etaient trop en gages, et qui ont fioi par se laisser influencer par les
                        nouvelles du beors et par les agrisenments de leurs adversaires.</p>
                    <p>Il est incontestalbe que la position se petrait admirablement a la mar coevre
                        qui asi bien resis, maise, maintenant que le decovert est en grade partie
                        elmine, n'u aurait-il pas lien de craindre une reaction non indifferente.
                        Avec l'american, il est certain que la situation de l'egyptien au piont de
                        vue des prix n'est plus ce qu'elle etait il y a deux on trois semaiens;
                        maise est-cjer en lui meme, sans compter qu'an bout du compte l'americain
                        cette hitaine, et par consequent il nous semble qu'a moins arrivent de
                        dehors, la logique exige que l'on se modre pour passfater une situation qui
                        est bonne en elle meme. La pussen des prix au delta de 17 tallaris a arrete
                        la conesommation et si par hassard les avis de degats a la recolte
                        americaine par les gelees ne vernaient pas e tre confirmes, nouse pourrions
                        bien voir l'abstention de la filature, meme monentanee, avec des arriaves de
                        plus copieuz, ous valoir un mauvaise tour. Les engagments de l'exportation
                        sont grands et le demande de sar par <cb n="2"/>pour le disponible sera
                        assez survie et de nature a sider au soutien des prix, maise il ne faudrait
                        pas oublier que d'autre part il ya a cette annee la question de la
                        precipitation avec laquelle la marchandise nous est expediee de l'interiur
                        et equie pourrait produire une agglomeration ou une alluence, aux effets de
                        la quelle il ne saurait etre remedie que par une continutation de la demande
                        de dehors. De la moderation donc, our aturement, nours pourions avoir a
                        njours reprentir par la suite.</p>
                    <p>En dehors de ce quie precede, il ya susi la qeustion de la recolte: Depuis
                        quelques juers les raports sont des plus favourable et les plus modes es dan
                        leurs estiamtions semblent etre pour les 6 ½ millions de cantar et, quoique
                        cela ne copte pour rein, nous ajoute rons que nous memes nours sommes
                        partisans de ce chifre. Beaucoup parlent meme de 6 ¾ et de 7 millions, mais
                        il pourrait y aboir de l'orgaizaton dans ces evlations. En tous cas la
                        chaleur a fait beaucoup de bein a la troise me cuiellete et si une surpise
                        du chef du rendemnt de la rcolte n'est par tres probable elle n'en reste
                        pasie moins dans le domaine du possible.</p>
                    <p>Un fait qui nous parlle signifat assi, est que l'interieru ne cease d'offrir
                        du coton d'une facan pressee. Si la recolte n'etait pas bonne est ce qu'il
                        aurait ete anieux de vendre.</p>
                    <p>L'activite a ete relativenient grande chez nous, mais elle a porte sur
                        l'ancienne recolte et surtout sur les mois elogies qui sont tous mait tenant
                        en report. Ou est donc l'egorgement dont on parliat pur Novembre Del al dont
                        les choses procendt, les haussiers emblelent res pressue de se reporter
                        probablement a cause de imporatnce des arriavages DAnt tous le case, le bon
                        seus indquie de profiter du bon marche des reports actuels.</p>
                    <p>L'Ameriquie continue a nour bombarder de depeches de tous les gnres miase le
                        pen de progres fait par les prix depuis que les gelles sont a l'ordre du

                        entravent pour la moment le mouvenmont asscesional. Auatn a la filature que
                        l'on dit tres preoccupes, elle ne bouge pas encor; elle attend probalbement
                        d'etre mieux fixee. Maise si elle n'schete pas, il y a par contre
                        fixaporatio americaine quie parlat recellement accoutn sur Octobre et bon
                        nobmre de depeches de New York attribuent une partie de la hausse a sees

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
