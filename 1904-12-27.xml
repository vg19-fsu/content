                    <head>PROPOSED SMALL-POX HOSPITAL.</head>
                    <p>While we hope that the correspondence in our columns which has followed the
                        recent lamentable death of a young Englishman in the Deaconesses' Hospital
                        will be productive of some result, and that the establishment of an isolated
                        small-pox hospital for the treatment of Europeans who may be attacked by
                        that terrible disease is a thing of the near future, we also sincerely trust
                        that the occasion may not be made the opportunity for an attack on the
                        excellent institution at which the death of Yousbashi Armstrong took place.
                        Englishmen should be thankful that such an institution as the Deaconesses'
                        Hospital exists in Alexandria. We know of a case-a surgical ne-treated there
                        last year with the utmost medical skill and nursing attention, both
                        successful to a degree that would have reflected the highest credit on the
                        best of our London | hospitals. The patient, a clerk in the office of one of
                        our great shipping companies, came to Egypt with his wife for the benefit of
                        a sea voyage, but was in so seriousa state on his arrival that an operation
                        of a difficult nature had to be performed. The wife remained in the hospital
                        with ar husband during the few weeks he staye. there, the charge for board
                        and residence in both cases being, we believe, P.140 per day. They at least,
                        have occasion to be thankful for the existence of the Deaconesses' Hospital
                        and for the medical skill Drs. Morrison and Nauphal, supplemented, as it
                        was, by the excellent nursing of the devoted women who, without monetary
                        recompense, so carefully and cheerfully attend the sick pe lients uuder
                        their charge. While Englishmer can receive such attention as this, it seems
                        somewhat premature to think of establishing en English Cottage Hospital
                        here, especially in view of the limited success that has attended the
                        Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo, where the English-speaking residents far
                        outuumber tholb in Alexandria and where even the influentii support the new
                        institution has received from Lord Cromer and others has failed to bring in
                        its trait the general support without which sucess is impossible.</p>

                    <p> While the significance of the progressive increase of death from bovine
                        typhus which has been noted dring the last month may be easily exaggerated,
                        and while there is no reason to apprehānd any really heavy mortality in the

                        early and complete disappearance of the epidemic. It is probable that
                        univourable climatic conditions, want of sun, raid weather, etc., are to a
                        large degree responsibl for this increase, but not a few men who are
                        qualified to advance their opinions of the subject are inclined to consider
                        it probal le that the cattle plague will continue with us for another two
                        years, though the inocilation of surviving animals and other med ures taken
                        by the Sanitary Department, coupled with the fact that a disease exhausts
                        itself, i.e., becomes in popular parlance "worked out,” will prevent any
                        mortality on a large scale in the future.</p>

                        GUTTED.<lb/>ENORMOUS DAMAGE.</head>
                    <p>At an early hour this morning, a destructive fire broke out in the very heart
                        of Alexandria. The scene of the conflagration was the Old Exchange Buildings
                        (Palais de l'Ancienne Bourse). The north portion of the ground floor of this
                        block of buildings is occupied by the editorial and printing offices of the
                        Egyptian Gazette, the large store of Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi, Limited,
                        is in the centre, while on the south side is the large and luxuriously
                        appointed bar belonging to the same firm. The whole of the upper portion of
                        the building is used as a cigarette factory, and belongs to Messrs. E.
                        Laurens &amp; Co., the manager of which firm is the owner of the
                        building.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the fire arose through the fusing of some electric wires
                        affixed to the ceiling at the back of Messrs. Walker &amp; Meimarachi's bar,
                        where the grill is situated. Shortly before 2 o'clock, while the bar was
                        still open, one of the employés saw that the ceiling in this part of the
                        establishment was on fire. The habitués and bar tenders quickly evacuated
                        the building, and by the time the Alexandria Fire Brigade made its
                        appearance, the fire had gained great hold over the inflammable contents,
                        and had spread to the bar. The flames leaped across the street, and if a
                        strong wind had been blowing Saint Mark's Buildings would have caught fire,
                        as well as the great pile of buildings which have been erected by Messrs.
                        Allen and Alderson on the other side of Old Bourse-street. Fortunately the
                        scaffolding around the latter building has recently been taken down.
                        Otherwise it would inevitably have caught. Owing to the exertions of the
                        Fire Brigade, under the command of Miralai Wapkinson Bey, Commandant of the
                        Alexandria City Police, and of the superintendent of the Fire Brigade, Sagh.
                        Lynn, the fire was prevented from spreading across the street, but it gained
                        complete mastery over the bar, which was absolutely gutted. The fire made
                        its way to the cigarette manufactory on the first floor, and dense volumes
                        of smoke came from the upper windows, while it spread with equal swiftuess
                        to the grocery and provision stores in the centre on the ground floor. The
                        entrances and windows of this store were broken into and the firemen poured
                        an endless stream of water on the contents, which included a great supply of
                        valuable 'Xmas and New Year presents. Almost all the goods were destroyed by
                        the fire or rendered valueless by the water.</p>
                    <p>It is as yet impossible to determine the extent of the loss either in the
                        case of the property of Messrs. Walker &amp; Meimarachi or of Messrs.
                        Laurens &amp; Co. The fire was got well under control by 5 o'clock, and was
                        successfully prevented from reaching our offices. Some idea of the
                        fierceness of the fames may be gathered, however, when we state that Mr.
                        Spathis's bar and Mr. Ipekian's cigarette stores opposite suffered. The
                        frontage of the latter was almost totally destroyed by the heat acting on
                        the woodwork and glass.</p>

                    <head>KAFR AMAR COLLISION. A PASSENGER'S NARRATIVE.</head>
                    <p>Mr. D. K. Reid, of the firm of Reid and Barnard, writes to us on 'Xmas Day,
                        from "between Assiout and Luxor," giving the following account of his
                        experiences in the recent accident:</p>
                    <p>It has been my misfortune to have taken my part for a second time in an
                        accident on the Egyptian State Railways. I was a passenger in the train
                        which was thrown off the rails at Kafr Dawar three years ago, and I was
                        again &amp; passenger last night in the express "train de luxe" which was
                        partially wrecked by a collision at Kafr Ammar. Our situation as passengers
                        w precisely similar to that in which we found ourselves before, with the
                        unfortunate difference that whereason that occasion weli had finished our
                        dinner, we had on this occasion barely begun it, and the interruption was
                        such as to preclude all possibility of continuing it.</p>
                    <p>Almost all the passengers, I think, were in the diping-car when the collision
                        occurred. | ! Fortunately they were few in number and only filled one half
                        of it, for, as you know, it is divided into two compartments. Had the other
                        half, that nearest to the kitchen, contained passengers, the results would
                        have been very 12 serious. As it was, of the three men who were at the
                        moment either in this section of the car, or in the kitchen, one European
                        waiter was badly cut and bruised; another was taken out with his leg broken
                        and other injuries ;|I and the native cook was so badly crushed that he died
                        &amp; few hours later. The shock of the collision was severe. The dining-car
                        was only separated from the engine and tender by at brake and luggage van.
                        This was driven right into the dining car, annihilating the kitchen and
                        two-thirds of one section; the wreckage which it carried with it stopping
                        within a few feet of the door leading into the other part where the
                        passengers were seated.</p>
                    <p>None of the carriages which made up the lo train left the line, and though
                        the lights in the dining-car were extinguished by the lo shock, there was
                        little confusion, and beyond | a few bruises no passenger received anyu
                        injuries.</p>
                    <p>The position of the engines left no doubt as to how the accident occurred.
                        They were locked together in close embrace as men who wrestle. For reasons
                        no doubt good in them-li selves, the up train to Cairo was stationary | 1 at
                        the Kafr Ammar platform on the down line. This appears to bave either
                        provoked the ire or appealed to the sporting instinctst of the "train de
                        luxe" mecanicien, who, disregarding all signals to the contrary, made for
                        the stationary train at &amp; pace which Ilt presume he considered necessary
                        to effect its removal. The results, if not in precise la accordance with his
                        expectations, were sufficiently important to warrant his detention.</p>
                    <p>Everything possible was done for the comfort and convenience of travellers by
                        the officials of the aministration and the sleeping-car service; and a
                        series of free meals was provided It between Minieh and Luxor as
                        compensation for the loss of the restaurant car dinner. At the same time I
                        should like to appeal to the railway It authorities to act with more
                        despatoh after such regrettable incidents, in forwarding pas- sengers to
                        their destinations. On this occasioni an engine was on the spot soon after
                        the acci- t dent, and it would have been the matter of an If hour or two at
                        most to have detached the lo uninjured carriages and sent them down to Ayat,
                        where the 8 p.m. express from Cairo was r in waiting and together with the
                        sleeping car could have been made up into one trainnecessarily with two
                        engines--and sent on its</p>
                    <p>ay to Luxor. This was in fact the course adopted; unfortunately it was
                        thought necessary to maintain the uninjured cars in situ until the arrival
                        of railway officials from Cairo, with the result that &amp; delay which
                        should have been of two hours was prolonged into one of eight. I should not
                        have called attention to this, had I not a vivid recollection of a similar
                        delay which followed the Kafr Dawar accident, when within a few miles of
                        Alexandria we were left for five hours, bereft of food and drink, to the
                        tender mercies of the mosquitoes which infest that neighbourhood.</p>

                    <p>In our recent issues we have published some very interesting details on the
                        subject of the Fête Comunittee for Cairo. The idea is a good one and we are
                        glad to see that the scheme, which we have advocated for years past, has at
                        last taken definite shape. With such names as those of Maitre Carton de
                        Wiart, Major Kenney-Herbert, M. Cattaoui, the Hon. F. C. Morgan, Mr. Chas.
                        Baebler, Nungovich Bey, Omar Bey Sultan, and Mr. Aspinali, we have no doubt
                        that the efforts of the committee will meet with every success, provided
                        that the public show some response in backing them up. The expenses will, of
                        course, be considerable and we believe that it is estimated that over |
                        £3,000 will have to be spent this season. The committee have decided to
                        issue posters every month giving a list of the fêtes which are to take
                        place, and handbills will also be distributed throughout the hotels and
                        leading resorts. The committee will also institute various forms of
                        amusement and entertainment for our visitors and we shall be glad to aid as
                        much as lies in our power towards the successful attainment! of such a
                        scheme. That something in this line can be done was evidenced by the great ,
                        success that attended the bataille de fleurs which was held in the grounds
                        of the Ghezireh Casino last March by a small committee of local

                        admirable. The fine anthem, "In the beginning was the Word," by Allen, was

                        this church morning and evening, the officiating clergyman on both occasions
                        being the Rev. A. C. W. Saunders, résident Scottish chaplain. Through the
                        kindness of members of the congregation and others, the church was
                        beautifully decorated for the occasion with evergreens and flowers. At the
                        morning service there was a large congregation, who joined heartily in the
                        singing, which included the well-known Christmas hymns "O come all ye 13
                        faithful" and "Hark the herald angels sing." Mr. Saunders took as his text
                        Revelation 3,</head>
                    <p>14, The Beginning of the creation of God." | There were, be said, two
                        creations, the old and the new; and as the Pre-Incarnate think the Eternal
                        Word was the beginning of the one, 80 was the lucernate Christ the beginning
                        of the other. When man had fallen, it was God's purpose to restore the
                        Divine Image in him and re-create him after a new pattern. This He did by
                        infusing into him a new life from a new source. And the new source was the
                        Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The work of the new creation began on the day
                        when Son of God assumed our flesh. Christ took nature that He might
                        transform it anew,that lle might enliven it with His perfect life, Hof an
                        and Divine. Christmas was thus the fival of the beginning of God's new
                        creatit. They celebrated this day the birthday of One who ushered in a new
                        era in the biste sy of the Universe. They kept Christmas as a pemorial that
                        God had stooped to be born fter the flesh in order that man might be bean
                        anew of the Spirit.--A celebration of H y Communion followed, at which
                        between and 40 received the Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>The Beyram holidays commered on the 8th inst. In the morning, H. E. the
                            Mudir of Suakin, Miralai Howard Bey, ld an official reception, which was
                            attended by all the Army officers and Government officials, the
                            notables, clergy, representaties of banks, shipping agents, and all the
                            prin ipal European and native merchants. After the reception Howard Bey
                            inspected the gard of honor furnished by the 3rd Battalion A. and three
                            cheers were given by the troofor H.H. the Khedive. In the afternoon a
                            lotball match took place outside the Suakin tes.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th and 10th athlete sports took place and proved to be very
                            successful. The greasy pole event was the most amusing one, as about 100
                            natives tried bo walk on the pole to reach the log of mutton which was
                            suspended at the end,' those that failed falling in the water. The
                            members of the committee took their stand on the verandah of the new
                            residence of Kaimakam Drury Bey, the controller ofSudan ports. The
                            latter was unable to take an active shere in the organisation, owing to
                            his being laid up wit his old complaint, rheumatic gout, whid he
                            contracted whilst cutting the sudd on the Upper Nile. He, however,
                            managed to tow the sports ensconced in an armchair his verandah. The men
                            of H.M.S. "Sealarkould not take part in the sports as the ves put to sea
                            on the 6th inst. for surveying wg k round Sheikh Barghout. She returned

                            arrived here from Suez (where she had been in dry-dock) on the 10th

                            accompanied by his principal engineers, Messrs. Mamprese and Felice, and
                            a great number European and native workmen from Egypt. He brought also a
                            large consignment of material and tools for making the bridges and about
                            half a ton of dynamite to be used in the quarries. Mr. Urquhart is
                            well-known in Egypt and the Sudan, as he has carried out several works
                            in Khartoum for the Sudan Public Works Dept., and several works were
                            execyted by him in connection with the Assouan Reservoir. Until the iron
                            bridges are erected the Sudan Government Railways are making temporary
                            wooden bridges under the supervision of Bimbashi Sowerby, R.E., Chief

                    <p>The concert at the Seame's Home on the 23rd inst., of the benefit for the
                        sailors in port, was one of the most enjoyable evening entertainments given
                        there for some time. The ball was simply packed, and tho thanks of all
                        present are due to the host and hostess, Admiral Sir Massie and Lady Blomfi
                        id, as also to the ladies and gentlemen who so sindly helped with the
                        musical portion. A capit programme was provided, and the hearty applause and
                        recalls testified to its appreciation by the audience. Mr. Hugh Blomfield
                        opened with a couple of violin solos (a) Berceuse Blave (6) Perpetuo Mobile,
                        rendered in quite &amp; masterly manner. Miss Cohu then sang with much tasto
                        "The sweetest girl in Dixie,” Mr. Nixon following with a capital rendering
                        of "The Outpost's Vigil," and as an encore he gave "Will o' the Wisp." Some
                        selections from the "Cingalee" were next given. The very pretty quartette,
                        "Spite of all that Lovers 10," sung by Lady Blomfield, Miss MunGavin and
                        Messrs. Nixon ar 1 Purvis, well deserved its encore, as also Mr. Byrne's
                        Cingalee and Mr. Hugh Blomfield's clever impersonation of Chambuddy Ram in
                        the comic songs That's all right" and "The Wonderful E lish Pot," which
                        brought the first part of the entertainment to &amp; close amidst peals of
                        cughter.</p>
                    <p>Refreshments were passed round during the interval, and the second part of
                        the concert commenced with a piano solo, a selection from "The Belle of New
                        York," played by Miss Cohu in a spirited manner. The great feature of the
                        evening's entertainment now followed, being selected parts of the comic
                        opera "San Toy,” as played some months back at the Abbas Helmy Theatre;
                        i.e., 1. "A posy from over the sea" (Poppy), 2. quartett and dance, "Pyn Ka

                        Hugh Blomfield. Each o these selections was encored and Poppy, Dalley,
                        Lieut. Harvey Tucker, Fo Hop, and, last but not least Li, may congratulate
                        themselves that they contributed in no small degree to the enjoyment of the
                        evening. The piano accompani. ments were kindly undertaken by Lady
                        Blomfield, Mrs. MunGavin, and Mrs. Baylis. The entertainment closed with
                        "God Save the King," but prior to dispersing lusty cheers were given for Sir

                    <head>THE NEW SUEZ CANAL PROJECT.</head>
                    <head>THE CONTENTIONS OF THE OTHER</head>
                    <head>SIDE</head>
                    <p>LONDON, Dec. 19th. It is an open secret that the Foreign Office is no more
                        enamoured of the new Suez Canal project than it was of the proposal in 1883
                        ; and the promoters will, therefore, have a hard task set them to get their
                        scheme sanctioned, if they ultimately decide to go forward with it.</p>
                    <p>The Suez Canal Company is not disposed to say anything with regard to the
                        complaints which Sir Theodore Angier says are the cause of the scheme being
                        revived. It is asserted, however, that the charges can be controverted if
                        any real necessity for their disproval arises. Of the complaints the most
                        specific is the alleged violation of an agreement concluded in London with
                        M. de Lesseps in 1883, whereby it was arranged that the rates would be
                        gradually reduced, and that no higher dividend than 25 per cent. would be
                        paid until the rates went down to 5frs. a ton. Last year the dividend was 28
                        per cent., while the rates stood at 8f. 500.</p>
                    <p>It is pointed out, on the other hand, that this version does not accurately
                        represent the terms of the agreement, which, it is said, took the form of an
                        amicable arrangement and not of a contract, and was concluded on the
                        understanding that if it were found to work unsatisfactorily it could be
                        altered. In many respects, it is contended, concessions have been made in
                        excess of the terms of the arrangement. With regard to the rates reductions
                        have been made. At the date of the ägreement dues were at the rate of 10frs.
                        &amp; ton; at present they are 8f. 50c., with the prospect of a further
                        reduction in 1906 of 50c. It is, of course, not disputed that a dividend of
                        26 per cent. was paid last year, but it is pointed out that only original
                        shareholders benefit to that extent. The Suez Canal shares have been
                        steadily rising in value for many years, and are at present quoted at 180,
                        which means that to the majority of the shareholders they yield nothing like
                        26 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The opposition maintain their view, and intend to bring all the pressure to
                        bear they possibly can in order to induce the Suez Canal directors to
                        redress their grievances.</p>

                    <head>THE PRICE OF EGYPTIAN COTTON.</head>
                    <head>A SUGGESTION FROM FRANCE. </head>
                    <p>The following letter from a very large French spinner is sent us by a firm of
                        cotton brokers at Liverpool to whom it has been addressed. Considering the
                        developments since the date of the letter, the first words are rather
                        prophetic :</p>
                    <p>"December 9, 1904. "My opinion is that Egyptian cotton is in the hands of
                        speculators, and that, whatever happens, it cannot maintain its price. Now,
                        the question is -- When will the decline come? In any case the spinner
                        cannot go on paying present prices; it would mean laying in stocks at a
                        great loss, because the use of Egyptian cotton yarn is going to be very much
                        restricted. The interest for the spinner would therefore be to commence
                        short time at once, and work only four days a week for two months. The mere
                        announcement of such a decision would certainly have the effect of bringing
                        down prices of Egyptian as compared with those of American. It is, in fact,
                        only makers of sewing cotton who can pay high prices; manufacturers of cloth
                        will not. As regards mercerised goods, they are quite out of fashion in
                        America, and very likely the same thing will occur in England and on the
                        Continent. And the demand for this article will fall off the more rapidly as
                        the price of Egyptian cotton is so exorbitant. An understanding is therefore
                        necessary between English and Continental spinners with a view to short
                        time, and by this means prices will be brought down to a reasonable level.
                        That is the only remedy for the speculative excesses.”</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTH.</p>
                        <p>Sir, -In your leading article on the 22nd inst. in reference to the above
                            subject you did me the honour to refer to a short and somewhat meagre
                            paper of mine, which you quoted from the Journal of the British Chamber
                            of Commerce in Egypt. As the subject is now attracting a good deal of
                            attention with reference to modern requirements, it may perhaps not be
                            out of place to make a few retrospective remarks in connection with it.
                            cr These are suggested to me by your observa- th tion that you fiud that
                            maritime opinion of entirely differs from mine on some of the du
                            suggestions I offer.</p>
                        <p>This sensible remark of yours seems to go to Y the root of the whole
                            matter. I do not M pretend to be an authority on maritime på opinion,
                            nor, to the best of my recullection, am I aware that any such authority
                            has ever P been consulted with reference to the inner D harbour of
                            Alexandria, or if he was, it is only too evident that his advice was
                            never carried out. The barbour was design be ed by the late Sir Juhu
                            Fowler, who was re then Eugineer-in-Chief to Ismail Pasha. i be Mr.
                            Fuwler was an emineut engineer, at th the bead of his profession as a
                            railway ca engineer, but no one in England ever considered him an
                            authority ou port or harbour works.</p>
                        <p>Every one admits that the breakwater of at the outer harbour is a fine
                            work, buth in its na conception and execution ; the inner harbour G has
                            well-built quays which reflect much credit buth on the resident engineer
                            and contractors, but it only requires little more than a super-R ficial
                            kuowledge of such matters to recognisem that it was uot desigued by the
                            hand of a b master. I do not hesitate to say that had this been done by
                            either of the four or five engineers B who were at that time the
                            recognised leaders in this branch of their profession, the result would
                            have been very different.</p>
                        <p>I was for a short time an assistant engineer on the staff of one of these
                            gentlemen, the late Sir Juhu Coode, then Engineer-in-Chief for the
                            Portland breakwater, one of the finest works of the kind eyer carried
                            out, and se &amp; veral other harbours, both on the English coast and
                            abroad. For several years after I 4 lett his service, I watched his work
                            with a interest, and I feel sure that if the Egyptian Government had
                            then consulted him and carried out his advice, the inner harbour would
                            have been much more useful than it now is.</p>
                        <p>When one reflects on the way in which worki was done iu Ismail Pasha's
                            time, it is wonderful that the harbour should be so good as it is. I
                            will give an instance which came under my personal obseryation in
                            1872.</p>
                        <p>Previous to 1869, Ismail Pasha had three sugar factories which brought
                            him in a considerable revenue. With more haste than discretion, he
                            ordered, at the same time, ten more factories larger than the other ; ho
                            paid liberally for them, but gave their makers 80 litale time to
                            complete them under heavy penalay, that they had hardly any opportunity
                            of studying their details to the best advantage.</p>
                        <p>The foundations and buildings were begun in such a hurry, under the
                            Khedive's personal directions, that little regard was paid to future
                            requirements, and it was not astonishing that the result was
                            unsatisfactory. Ismail Pasha had in his service engineers who gave him
                            good advice as to requisite improvements, but he thought he would go one
                            better, and brought out from England, at great expense, a Commission
                            consisting of three members, each of whom was eminent in his particular
                            sphere ; they knew a great deal about many things, but unfortunately
                            nothing about sugar factories.</p>
                        <p>No doubt many circumstances contributed *to the ill-success of the
                            scheme, but I believe that the above incident marked the parting of the
                            ways between success and failure, of what might otherwise have been a
                            prosperous undertaking. But misfortune followed it still further. It was
                            decided to sell several of the factories, but only one of them was sold
                            at à fairly good price, and the Egyptian Government rather uufortunately
                            undertook to deliver it at Mauritius. They wanted to do it as cheaply as
                            possible, and sent the principal parts in one of their own ships, an old
                            one, not I believe very seaworthy; at all events she sunk in the Red
                            Sea, and it was only after the <cb n="2"/>cargo was entirely lost they
                            found out that someone had forgotten to insure it!</p>
                        <p>This digression is only intended to remind your readers, that money was
                            not always well spent in Egypt in those days.</p>
                        <p>If I have ventured to make some slight criticisms on the design of some
                            parts of the harvour of Alexandria, I hasten to say how vas' an
                            improvement it was on anything which existed here before, and it is
                            undoubtedly one of the finest relics of an extravagant age.</p>

                        <p>Sir,--As an old resident I consider your strictures on the Anglo-American
                            community as regards their financial support of the above institution as
                            uncalled-for as was the institution itself. It was not wanted and, as
                            has been proved, was not required. There were other hospitals already in
                            existence on which the money collected would have been far better spent.
                            Why in the name of heaven should you "rattle" the dual community for not
                            supporting a scheme which was toisted on it stillborn. Those who
                            remember how the idea of the hospital originated will appreciate the
                            last remark.</p>

                    <p> The Admiralty has placed the armoured cruiser "Essex" (Captain R. B.
                        Farquhar) at the disposal of Field-Marshal H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, K.
                        G., who, in discharge of his duties as luspector-General of His Majesty's
                        Army, will leave England early in the New Year to inspect the garrisons of
                        Gibraltar, Malta, and Egypt. The Duke will be accompanied by the Duchess and
                        his staff. Next month the "Essex" will be taken in hand at Portsmouth for
                        the reception of the Duke and Duchess and their respective suites.</p>
                    <p>It seems that the Army Council has thought better of it, and the 56th Battery
                        R. F. A. with remain for the present at Cairo. Amongst the best kuown
                        military experts the reduction of the army of occupation-particularly the
                        cavalry arm--in Egypt is greatly deprecated.</p>

                        Adjutant General at Cairo, has been formally promoted lieutenant-colonel

                    <head>WHY KIDNEY DISEASE IS SO SERIOUS.</head>
                    <p>Kidney disease is serious, because it comes on so quietly. It has many
                        symptoms, bu often they are mistaken for other diseases. Headaches,
                        rheamatism, a nervous, irritable condition, weak heart, dropsy,
                        sleeplessness," an always tired feeling, yellow complexion, unnatural urine,
                        too much or too little urinethese are just as much symptoms of kidney
                        disease as backaches, gravel, bladder troubles,</p>
                    <p>etc.</p>
                    <p>1 Kidney disease may have been working in the system for years before the
                        patient suspected the cause of his trouble. That's the danger</p>
