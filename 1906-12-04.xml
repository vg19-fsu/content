                            <p>Stormy scenes were witnessed during the debate on the colonial policy
                                on Saturday. Herr Bebel declared that the insurrection in
                                Darmaraland had been a gold mine to contractors. He read a letter
                                detailing horrible atrocities amongst the Cameroons, and named the
                                guilty officers. He asserted that only the small thieves had been
                                hanged, the big ones had escaped. The entire colonial
                                administration, he said, ought to be placed in the dock. He accused
                                three members of the raichstag by name with having abused their
                                position as deputies. This caused an uproar. Another Democratic
                                deputy said that they should look at the criminals. Owing to the
                                tumult the sitting was adjourned. (Reuter)</p>

                                again and was ordered to the guard room. The matter was afterwards
                                hushed up. Other seamen corroborated this statment but differed in

                    <p>Reports just received show that Sir Reginald Wiugate, K.C.B., Governor
                        General of the Sudan, who is at present on a tour of inspection in the White
                        Nile and Kordofan Provinces, is everywhere meeting with an enthusiastic
                        reception from the natives of the various towns and villages en route. At
                        Dueim, which was decorated for the occasion, and at Um Dam and the smaller
                        villages which were passed, his Excellency was greeted by enthusiastic
                        crowds. On every side were evidences of the remarkable development of the
                        country since the Sirdar's last visit to the district in 1901. It was
                        evident that an increase of population alone is needed to enable enormous
                        tracts of the extremely fertile land in these districts to be planted with
                        dura and dukn.</p>
                    <p>Bara was reached on the 26th, and here his Excellency was met by the
                        officials and Sheikhs ali el Tom (of the Kababish) Abdullah Gadallah (of the
                        Kababish) Abdullah Gadallah (of the Kawahla), Munhal Kheirallah (of the
                        shenabala), the omdeh of the district, and by hundreds of minor sheikhs.
                        After inspecting the towns and barracks, his Excellency held a largely
                        attended reception at the Mamourieh. His Excellency's visit to El Obeid on
                        the 28th was made the occasion of a magnificent demonstration. He was met on
                        his entry to the town by 1,500 horsemen under their sheikhs, while on either
                        flank charged horsemen in robes and coats of mail with spears and ponnauts.
                        The streets, which were thronged by cheering onlookers, were gaily decorated
                        with bunting and flags, and were lined with irregular Arab and Nuba
                        riflemen. Every Arab tribe was represented and it is difficult to estimate
                        the numbers of Nuba and Dinkas present. Amongst other sheikhs present was
                        Hamid Abusakin and his followers.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently the troops, who were 1,050 strong, consisting of the Camel Corps
                        and detachments from the 8th and 15th Battalions, with guns, paraded before
                        his Excellency. Messengers from Ali Dinar, of Darfur, attended, bringing
                        with them three stallions as presents to the Government.</p>
                    <p>In the evening the town was brilliantly illuminated and there was a firework
                        display followed by a torchlight "tattoo" and Daluka (native dance) which
                        was attended by the officers, native notables, and European merchants.
                        Throughout the afternoon and evening enthusiastic crowds thronged the
                        streets.</p>

                        <p>In my last notes I mentioned that Bimbashi Lord would replace Bimbashi
                            Newcombe as railway agent at Suakin. This arrangement has now been
                            altered, as Mr. Hickley, district engineer Suakin-Atbara line, has
                            arrived here from Gebeit and taken over the duties of agent at Suakin.
                            Bimbashi Newcombe, R.E. has left for Atbara to take over the duties of

                        <p>It has been decided to erect a large bridge from the present railway
                            station in Port Sudan town across the narrow neck of the harbour, for
                            trains to run into the town. This bridge has been ordered and the
                            excavations for the masonry work habe been commenced. The railway line
                            from Asortriba to Port Sudan, which ahs been bridged, has now been
                            slightly altered and the bridging by the contractor, Mr. George Urquart,

                    <head>SITUATION IN EGYPT.<lb/>MR. COPE WHITEHOUSE AGAIN.</head>
                    <p>Under the heading of "The Situation in Egypt," the "Wall Street Journal" (New
                        York) publishes the following letter from Mr. Cope Whitehouse, with the
                        subject of which we deal in our leading article today: --</p>
                    <p>It is now obvious that the Egyptian financial situation has been hitherto
                        misrepresented and misunderstood. It would appear doubtful wheather, until
                        whithin the last few months outside of a few European banking houses, there
                        was any conception of the liabilities which had been incurred; or
                        appreciation of the dangerous facility with which a large amount of gold;
                        amounting, perhaps, to forty million dollars, might be suddenly transferred
                        from the principal banks to the private revenes, or secret boards of small
                        peasant proprietors in the Delta. An Egyptian cotto crop of about
                        550,000,000 pounds represents over a hundred million dollars. </p>
                    <p>After the British occupation, Sir Edgar Vincent, as Financial Adviser,
                        created an Egyptian silver coinage, in order that the seigniorage of this
                        "token money" could be used for current expenditure. The process has
                        continued to the present time. According to Mr. Roussin, there was "a
                        superabundance" of silver coin in December, 1904; yet, during 1904, the
                        Government issued a further amount of $2,625,000, redeemable at par in gold.
                        "Stocks of silver coin accumulated in the hands of bankers and merchants,
                        who found it impossible to dispose of them. The superfluity of gold coin,
                        (estimated at about 60% of the import for that year), found its natural
                        outlet through th emedium of re-export, but that of silver remained as a
                        clog on the internal trade, representing a lock-up of capital attended with
                        loss to those who were unfortunate enough to find themselves its custodians.
                        To remedy this situation and to relieve the community of an unequal burden,
                        there was evidently one measure and one only indicated, to wit, the
                        assumption of the charge by the Government. Arrangements were accordingly
                        made in January, 1905, to receive silver coins against gold at the
                        Government treasuries and at the National Bank of Egypt." No statistics are
                        available to show what is the whole amount of Egyptian silver that has been
                        coined. Although gold is now going to Egypt, with a probable diminution in
                        December and January, yet, in 1905, it was imported into Egypt as late as
                        March and April. A portion of this was re-exported in June and July,
                        leaving, however, $15,000,000 as a permanent loss, for that year only, to
                        the international specie reserves of America and Europe.</p>
                    <p>The important point made is, how to ascertain what provision has been made by
                        the Financial Adviser to meet the January coupons and other financial
                        obligations of an equally peremptory character. The more the incongruous and
                        contradictory statements, put forth apparently on the highest authority, are
                        examined, the greater the puzz's and the worse the outlook. The interest on
                        the debt is $17,940,555, exclusive of the Turkish tribute, and other similar
                        charges. The Unified, $179,860,000 is, according to M. Delcasse, all held in
                        France. It calls for $11,194,400 annually. Evidently the Bank of France, and
                        not the Bank of England, will be required to earmark so much of its gold
                        reserve as may be required to meet the interest on this part of the Egyptian
                        debt.</p>
                    <p>The reserve fund, which Lord Cromer reported at $60,440,000 in January, 1906
                        is in reality only $5,250,000, in depreciated silver money, a poor
                        equivalent with which to meet gold coupons due in Paris and London.</p>
                    <p>It may be considered as certain that the Bank of England raised its rate as
                        part of a series of operations, by which it is endeavouring to arrange to
                        carry over Egyptian commmitments, until, in April, 1907, a Fractional part
                        of the gold now going to Egypt may be re-exported to Europe. It is equally
                        clear that the Bank of France is now co-operating, and making provision for
                        the movement of the cotton crop as well as for the January dividends on the
                        Unified.</p>

                        <p>The Dongola came into collision in the Canal with the R.M.S. Orontes. The

                        <head>RESCUE OF A LASCAR.</head>
                        <p>The R.M.S. orontes landed at Suez yesterday a Lascar named Youssef Ali
                            who was picked up at sea near Colombo in the following circumstances: --
                            At 9 p.m. on the 22nd November last, when the Orontes was about a mile
                            outside the breakwater, a human voice was heard, apparently calling for
                            help. The ship's engines were at once stopped and reversed and a boat
                            lowered, and at 9.55 the latter returned with a native in a very
                            exhausted condition. He was immediately attended to by the surgeen, and
                            through an interpreter he stated that he was a native of Sy'hat, aged 20
                            years, a Mohamedan fireman belonging to the S.S. Chisholm, which left
                            Colombo at 7 p.m. on the 22nd ult. He stated that he fell overboard
                            about that hour just after the vessel left. the man had been in the
                            water for about two hours, and it is remarkable that he was not devoured
                            by sharks.</p>

                            arrived at Suez Docks early this morning. The S.S. Dongola came out of
                            the Canal at 7 a.m., when the troops were transported to the ship in
                            lighters. The Dongola sailed from Suez bound to Karachi at 4 p.m.</p>

                    <head>ARE EGYPTIANS FANATICS?<lb/>MOSLEMS V. COPTS.</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir, -- In your Monday's issue I noticed a letter written by a "Native of
                        Upper Egypt," which I read with interest, and would like to remark upon.</p>
                    <p>Your correspondent, if I understand him rightly, begins by asking the
                        question at the head of his letter, and then says that an answer in the
                        negative or affirmative is equally fallacious. This seems rather paradoxical
                        to anyone who is accustomed to receive a plain answer to a plain
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Personally I believe that all Moslems are at least potential fanatics, and I
                        have lived among them for many years in Morocco, South Arabia, and East
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>There seems to me no question about the unrest that obtains at present Egypt.
                        I was here lat in 1897, and on this second visit was astonished at the
                        general attitude of insolence and intolerance adopted towards Europeans by
                        the lower classes of natives in teh streets of Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Your correspondent goes on to inform us that this feeling of contempt towards
                        Christians is based largely upon the attitude adopted towards Copts in the
                        various schools throughout the country.</p>
                    <p>He tells us that native Christians are not received with the same enthusiasm
                        as Moslem pupils, and that the Copts have to observe Mohamedan holidays,
                        while the Moslems-- although in a minority-- have the school kept open for
                        them during 'Xmas, etc. He moreover compmlains that Moslems are invariably
                        preferred to native Christians, when applying for Government billets, and
                        adds a somewhat vagne warning, that unless these things are altered, our
                        British administration is likely to meet with trouble. I sympathize with
                        your correspondent. It does seem hard to have to take a back seat, after
                        having enjoyed the plums of Government service for many years.</p>
                    <p>I belong to the Church of England and have for the last twelve years worked
                        and travelled among the up country tribes of South Arabia and Somaliland;
                        engaged on scientific research, or work in connection with the Intelligence
                        Department. I have seen the fighting Arab-- both desert horsement and
                        mountaineer-- in his own home, and have learnt to appreciate his good
                        qualities, which are engendered and fostered by the religion that he adheres
                        to. I admit that he may be justly charged with a blood-thirsty and
                        vindictive spirit and sometimes treachery --and always sensuality; but he
                        can also lay claim to sterling courage, endurance, patriotism, and
                        frugality. His hospitality is proverbial and his marvellous gifts of poetry
                        and imagery must be experienced to be properly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The Moslem is, however, by nature a poor scholar. His restless temperament
                        and the narrow groove in which Islamic education runs, are no doubt, factors
                        against him. The Copts and many other intellectual races have taken
                        advantage of this for centuries races have taken advantage of this for
                        centuries, and now Islam is forging ahead in this respect, it behoves your
                        correspondent and his co-religionists to make a strenuous effort to again
                        out strip the Moslem in education as they used to do, not forgetting to
                        preserve and foster among thier younger generation traditions of integrity
                        and honour, without which no intellectual gifts can ever obtain recognition
                        from those in high places. Surely your correspondent does not really think
                        that the "superiority" (as he terms it) of Christianity required
                        demonstrating by proclamative or secular teaching. If any contempt rests
                        upon Christians it is caused by our own actions, and not by the religion
                        which we adhere to, for Moslems themselves deeply reverance the name of
                        Christ as a Prophet and Teacher, as every student knows, and frequent
                        passages in the Koran speak of a kindly and respectful attitude towards
                        Christians.</p>
                    <p>Christianity can stand alone, without being bolstered up by Government
                        edicts; in fact, she has never flourished better than in the stress of
                        persecution, as we all know-- and if we Christians want to make our religion
                        respected in an alien country instead of merely displaying a complacent
                        feeling of superiority, we might try what we can do by practising a few of
                        the Christian virtues which we have been taught upon the people around
                        us.</p>
                    <p>I don't personally think much of the Cairene lowwer-class Moslems, but
                        criticism is out of place, for we must remember that they have been brought
                        more closely into touch with Europeans than perhaps any other of their
                        co-religionists throughout the world. it is a melancholy fact that we do not
                        improve Islamic races, wherever we come in contact with them.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile I hope that "A Native of Upper Egypt" will "keep his tail up" and
                        not fall back among the rack; and also bear in mind that in Moslem country,
                        Islamic holidays will naturally receive preference in most schools-- Yours,
                        etc.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned by us a few days back, Sir John Harrington, K.C.V.O., British
                        Minister at the Court of the Emperor Menelik, is expected in Cairo some time
                        next month. He started from Adis Abeba in October, and as he remains in
                        Egypt for about a week, as the guest of Lord Cromer, Colonel Harrington is
                        not likely to be in England before some time in February. At present he is
                        travelling through the different British Protectorates in Africa. Later on
                        in the spring he will be included in one of the King's house parties at
                        Sandringham, and this will remind him that three years ago, on the King's
                        birthday, he was knighted by his Majesty in the ballroom at Sandringham,
                        Wither he had been commanded to attend.</p>

                <head>THE KING'S OWN SCOTTISH BORDERS.</head>
                <p>THE HISTORY OF A GALANT OLD REGIMENT.</p>
                <p>As already announced in the "Gazette," the 1st Battalion King's Own Scottish
                    Borders, under the command of the Lieutenant Colonel D.A. Macfarlane, D.S.O.,
                    with Major C.J.A. McArthur second in command, arrived at Alexandria, per the
                    S.S. Dongola, on Saturday, and proceeded to Cairo, where they are now quartered
                    in the Citadel.</p>
                <p>The King's Own Scottish Borders had their origin in the stirring days of the
                    Revolution of 1688-89. When the news of the successful landing of William Prince
                    of Orange, at Torbay, and the flight of James from England, reached Scottland,
                    some 6,000 westland Covenauters rose and marched to Elinburgh, and laid siege to
                    the castle in the name of William. Their banners bore a badge the open Bible and
                    the motto, 'For Reformation, according to the word of God." From amongst these
                    worthies the gallent Earl of Leven formed a regiment, under a commission from
                    William, dated march 10th, 1689. Inside the almost incredible time of twenty
                    four hour the regiment was recruited to 800 ran and file, officed, armed, and
                    equipped. After the Castle fell, the "Elinburgh, Regiment," as it was then
                    designated, went with Mackay's army in the operations against the Jacobite
                    Highlanders. At the Battle of Killiecrankie the regiment, along with an English
                    one, now the Somersetshire Light Infantry, "saved the honour of the army," by
                    covering the retreat of the others when the victorious Highlanders swept the
                    field in an all conquering charge. Subseqently the regiment was conceded with
                    the unique priviledge of "beating up for recruits in Edinburgh at any time
                    without asking leave of the Lord Frovost," and it enjoys the same obsolete
                    priviledge to the present day. Its next services were in the Williamite wars in
                    Ireland 1691-92, during which it participated in the sieges of Athlone, Galway,
                    and Limerick, and other Irish garrisons which held out gallantly in a worthless
                    cause. In pursuance of William's policy of crushing the power in France, as soon
                    as Ireland was pacificated, the regiment was sent with others to join the allies
                    in Flanders, At the battle of Steinkirk, where the Williamite troops were
                    defeated by sheer weight of numbers, the Edinburgh Regiment fought so stubbornly
                    that it was almost cut to pieces, along with four other British regiments on
                    which the brunt of the fighting fell."The ground where the conflict raged was
                    piled with corpses, and those who buried the slain remarked that almost all of
                    the wounds had been given in close fighting by the sword or bayonet." No return
                    of teh killed and wounded was made, but in the brigade to our regiment belonged,
                    102 officers, and 1,114 rank and file alone were killed and wounded. The
                    Edinburgh Regiment was recruited by drafts for the battle of Landen, and here
                    again it was stricken heavily. It was of this action -- sometimes called
                    "Nearwinden," --that Macanley wrote his well known lines: "It is probable at
                    amongst the 120,000 soldiers who were marshalled round Neerwinden under all the
                    banners of Western Europe the two feeblest in body were the hunchbacked dwarf
                    (the Duke of Luxembourg) who urged forward the firey onset of France, and teh
                    asthmatics skeleton (William) who covered the slow retreat of England."
                    Technically, Luxembourg won, but he lost so many men --some 15,000 in action--
                    that his victory (1) was no advantage to him. Amongst the slaim was the brave
                    Irish soldier. Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan, and 20,000 corpses -- almost as
                    many as, were killed in the three years' fighting of the late Boer war-- on the
                    field attested to the stubbornness with which 60,000 British and Dutch contested
                    the field against 95,000 French. William, as in all his previous battles, took
                    the risks in action of the common soldiers. Two of his led horses we killed
                    beside him, one bullet passed through his hat, a second pierced his coat, and a
                    third struck his scarf knot and wounded his side. At the seige of Namur the
                    Elinburgh Regiment bore a gallant part, which reminds us that at this time the
                    originals of "Uncle Toby" and "Corporal Trim," immortalised in Sterne's
                    "Tristram Shandy," were serving in the corps. We fear that the godly spirit of
                    1689 had sadly deteriorated, for the unimpeachable "Uncle toby" has left it on
                    record that "our army swore in Flanders," in a manner leaving nothing to be
                    desired, and speaking from personal knowledge, we regret that in ungnarded
                    moments modern Tommy Atkins is wont to express himself in a sufficiently lurid
                    style to establish a claim to regimental heredity. "Uncle Toby" was Captain
                    Stern, uncle of the author, and "Corporal Trim" was Corporal James Butler. At
                    the storming of Namur, King William directed the attack, and as he saw his
                    victorious redcoats force the breaches he cried to the Elector of Bavaria,
                    "Look, look at my brave English." Brave, ind, they were, for the bones of 2,000
                    of the Namur's walls. It may be of erest dd that in this campaign, which was
                    nated in 1697, by the peace Byk, Colonel Maxwell, who commanded the regiment
                    adopted the sockated bayonet, and his men were enabled to fire in action with
                    fixed bayonets. During the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 and the Vigo Bay
                    expedition, 1719, the regiment saw considerable service and it also shared in
                    the defense of Gibraltar in the siege of 1727-28. The long wars of the Spanish
                    succession gave the 25th Regiment, as it had been styled, opportunities of again
                    proving its valour, and at Dettingen, under the eye of King George II., the last
                    British king who <cb n="2"/>risked his life in action, it contributed its share
                    in gaining that victory, although it is not borne of the colours, and at the
                    battle of Fontery, after fighting valiantly for victory, it was one of the last
                    in retreat. From the Continent it was hurriedly recalled as the Highland
                    Jacobites had again risen, and in the campaign of 1745 it was actively employed
                    at Falkirk and Culloden, which last action for ever crushed the hope of the
                    Stuarts. This over, the 25th was sent back to the Continent for the conclusion
                    of the war there, and acquired fresh distinctions at Val, where it captured two
                    French standards.</p>
                <p>The outbreak of the Seven Years' War once more found the 25th in the tented
                    field, and one of its first actions in that protracted struggle, and the first
                    on its regimental colours, was the battle of Minden, fought on 1st August, 1759,
                    by 30,000 British and their allies, under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, and
                    69,000 French and Bavarians, under Marshal de Contades. The skillful maneuvring
                    of Prince Ferdinand led Constades to believe that all he had to do was to
                    advance and drive the allies off the field, but at the end of a rapid march, the
                    tables were turned, and the allied forces, although much inferior numerically,
                    having lured the French into an unfavourable position. attacked them on the
                    plain of Minden, which town was in possession of the French. In a morning
                    remarkable for beauty, we are told that the 12th, 23rd, and 37th British
                    regiments, followed by the 20th, 25th, and 51st, under Major General waldegrave
                    and Major General Kingsley, and flanked by two battalions of Hanoveriann Foot
                    Guards and the regiment of Hardenburg, supported by three battalions of
                    Hanoverians and a battalion of Russian Foot Guards, advanced to attack the left
                    wing of the French army, where Marshal de Contades had posted the elite of his
                    calvary, the carabineers and genarmes. The 12th, 23rd, and 37th led the attack
                    in gallant style. As they moved forward the enemy'sartillery opened a tremendous
                    fire, and the French carabineers advanced to charge the British infantry. A
                    volley fro mthe leading regiments smote the charging equadrons ; many men fell;
                    the survivors reined up their horses, wheeled about, and retired, their
                    artillery recommencing its fire as the horsemen cleated the front. The
                    Hanoverian Brigade came up, on the left of the British regiments. Soon another
                    line of French cavaliers, gay in splendid uniforms, and formidable in numbers,
                    came forward, the soldiers shouting and waving their swords: but they were
                    struck in mid onset by a tempest of bullets from the British regiments, brok,
                    and driven back with severe loss. Pressing onward with a conquering violence the
                    British brigades became exposed to the fire of the enemy's musketry; but nothing
                    could sotp them. Elevated by success and confident in their own prowess, they
                    followed up the advantages they had already gained, and drove the French cavalry
                    out of the field. Two brigades of French infantry endeavoured to stem the
                    torrent of battle, but they were broken and dispersed. A body of Saxon troops
                    made a show of coming down on the British regiments, but they were too soon put
                    to flight. The enemy's line gave way, a general confusion among the French
                    regiments followed, and the numerous legions of France were driven from the
                    field, with a loss of 43 pieces of cannon, ten pair of colours, seven standards,
                    and many officers and soldiers. At the succeeding actions of Warbourg, Gumpen,
                    Fellinghausen, and Wilhelmethal the 25th was present, and needless to say
                    acquitted itself gallantly. Whilst at home in 1782 an arrogant Lord Provost of
                    Edinburgh contested the privilege of the 25th to beat up recruits in the city
                    without his permission, and territorial names then coming into fashion, the name
                    of the corps was changed to the 25th "Sussex Regiment," on the application of
                    Lord George Henry Lennox, Mr. P., Colonel of the regiment, who was much angered
                    at the slight put on it. Under this name the 25th took part in the relief of
                    Gibraltar 1782, and the remainder of its defence up till the seige was raised
                    the following year. During the Revolutionary war the 25th saw much service as
                    marines on the flee's of Lord Howe, Lord Hood, and Admiral Hotham, two
                    detachments of the Marlborough and Gibraltar representing it on the "Glorious
                    First of June," 1794. Details left in England were raised to two battalions,
                    which did duty in the West Indies, and the whole corps subsequently was reunited
                    into a single battalion for the expdedition to Holland 1799. At the battle of
                    Egmont-op-Zee, the Grenadier company notably distinguished itself and two years
                    later the regiment was in Abercromby's army which beseiged and captured
                    Alexandria and drove Napoleon's "Invincibles," as they arrogantly styled
                    themselves, rom the "Land of the Pharaohs." A second battalion was formed in the
                    border counties in 1804, but did not see any active service till almost the
                    close of the Peniusular war, when it was represented at Stalaund and Rostock,
                    1813, and in Holland, 1814-15. when Waterloo was fought and won, it was in
                    garrison at Antwerp. Meanwhile, King George III, by a general order, dated May
                    7th, 1805 was pleased to direct that the 25th should be known as "25th King's
                    Own Borders," and under that designation the 1st battalion had a varied service
                    from 1807, including teh occupation of Madeira, the capture of Martinique, 1809,
                    its recapture in 1815, and Guadeloupe, the same year. The 2n battalion was
                    disbanded in 1816. Whilst the depot was at Berwick in 1826 the ancient privilege
                    of beating up recruits in the Scottish capital without the leave of Bumbledom
                    was revived and confirmed. From 1842, when it saw some service against the
                    Boers, down till the Afghan war 878-80 it saw no active service, if we except
                    the Fenian fiasco in Canada in 1866. In Afghanistan, it saw a lot <cb n="3"/>of
                    hard service, including the expedition to the Hazara Valley. A 2nd battalion was
                    raised in 1859, and its record of ervices includes the operations on the Sudan
                    frontier, 1889, the Chitral campaign. 1896 and the Tirah expedition of 1898. In
                    1887 the name of the regiment was altered to its present one, the "King's Own
                    Scottish Borders" and under the territorial scheme of 1881 the depot was
                    permanently loted at Berwick. When Paul Johannes Kruger sent his famous
                    ultimatum to Britain in October, 1889, the 1st Battalion was stationed in the
                    Irish capital. When it came apparent that it was not "a little war," but one of
                    considerable dimensions that the Empire was to engage in, the battalion was sent
                    to Aldershot, where it was rapidly mobilised and despatched to the Cape from
                    Southampton on the 4th January, 1900, as a unit of Chermside's or the 14th
                    Brigade in Tucker's 7th Division. A month later, the battalion, 1,000 strong,
                    under Lieutenant Colonel J.W. Godfray, was in teh thick of the fighting for the
                    relief of Kimberley. It was in the actions leading up to Cronje's surrender at
                    Paardeberg, where it had several casualties, including Captain Pratt, wounded;
                    Poplar Grove, Driefrontein, and Karree Siding. In the latter action, one of the
                    sharpest of the campaign, the brunt of the battle fell on the Borderers and East
                    Lancashires, to whose lot it fell to clear the Boers from a position which was
                    almost impregnable. It was at first thought the Dutchmen had abandoned teh
                    kopjes till a tremendous fire at close quarters showd they had not. Captain
                    Goingaa brave Irish officer, was killed, Lieutenant E.M. young, was mortally
                    wounded, two other officers were wounded, and the regiment lost 20 stout
                    fellows, and 50 were wounded. One Boer shell killed five men. This action
                    cleared this part of the country, so that they did not die in vain. The
                    Borderers were at the crossing of the Vet and Zand Rivers, and participated in
                    teh fighting outside Johannesburg and the march on Pretoria. About this time the
                    Borderers, with the Berkshires, Argyll and Sutherland's, Mahon's and Pilcher's
                    mounted infrantry, with some artillery, including M. Battery R.H.A., were formed
                    into a separate command, under Major General Ian Hamilton, and it is recorded of
                    his "little army," that it put in as much hard work in marching and fighting as
                    any body of troops in the whole campaign, as a glance over Lord Roberts's
                    despatches will show. From that period, the battalion was very actively engaged
                    in the harassing pursuit of the Boer guerillas, and had its full share in the
                    "drives" and "bags" made down to the close of the war, including the actions at
                    Vlakfontein, Zilikats Nek, for detailed description of which want of space
                    prevents us. Suffice to say that during the wearisome war the Borderers fought
                    as valiantly and suffered as uncomplainingly as did their regimental ancestors
                    in the long gone campaigns above referred to. But many a brave lad from teh
                    tweedside, the hills and glens of Dumfries, Selkirk, and Roxburgh, lies under
                    the veldt for the honour of the gallant old 25th. The regimental casualties by
                    battle and disease were 200, and comparitively few of the original rank and file
                    returned home with the colours. The regiment is recruited in the shires above
                    mentioned and these probably produce the best type of Lowland soldier for they
                    are the descendants of the turbulent hard-fighting men of the Border Marches.

                    <head>UNE CREPULE D'ISLAM</head>
                    <p>M. Andre Chevrillon, whose study of our Coronation attracted great and
                        deserved attention in England, in his "un Crepuscule d'Islam" (Paris,
                        Hachette) improves upon his "Terres Motres," or volume on the Holy Land.
                        This time it is a visit to Fez with which the word pictures are concerned.
                        The style of the earlier descriptions here reminds us of Fromentin's two
                        volumes upon Algeria; and the chosen band of readers know this to be the
                        highest praise. In Fromentin perfection of style is attained in passages
                        which contain but little thought; and thought, as contrasted with poetry, is
                        somewhat wanting in Fromentin's African books. M. Chevrillon showed in his
                        English studies the highest powers as a critic and historian; but it is not
                        easy to combine his best work as regards substance with his best in form.
                        When, therefore, he reaches Fez and speculates upon the stagnation of Islam,
                        there are passages in which style degenerates into mannerism, while the
                        thought is at a high level. The detachment from the world of the really
                        religions Mohamedan, as he is found among the Moors of illustraious lineage,
                        has been described by many writers -- never better than by M. Chervillon.
                        The contrast presented within two or three miles of the most venerated
                        mosques by the equally separate, through extraordinarily different Jewish
                        world is put before the reader by M. Chevrillon with the vividness of Mr.
                        Kipling, but with French abherence to literacy tradition. In his account
                        ohis reception by the Jews who are compelled to live in thier separate,
                        walled quarter 'in the shade of Fez," M. Chevrillon reaches the highest
                        point that he has yet attained in philosophic travel, just as in the
                        earliest pages of this volume he reaches his highwater mark of style. Our
                        author is well acquainted with the result of the recent investigation into
                        the ethnography of the Jews. He knows that they are but partly descendedm
                            <cb n="4"/> from the sacred tribes -- that they have incorporated, in
                        teh course of their strange history, Tentons, Slavs, Ugrians, and people of
                        many other races. The traditions of the chosen people, and the circumstances
                        in which they have been compelled to live, have imprinted upon all common
                        characteristics which are powerfully illustrated in this chapter. The
                        Mohamedan world and the Jewish world have both the advantage over us of
                        rejecting the colour test and the colour bar: one of the superioritie whi
                        account for the continued progress of the Mohamedan religion in Africa and
                        in the Malay Archipelago, and for the vitality of the Jews.</p>

                        <p>(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                        <p>The above two well-known rivals met at Ghezireh in a friendly encounter.
                            The Irishmen were bady handicapped owing to several of their players
                            being on the sick list. At the time appointed for starting, only five
                            Lancashire men turned out, but as time wore on they all appeared. The
                            inniskillings were represented as follows: Goal, Howlett; backs, Branagh
                            and Ward; halves, Strain, Williamson, and Smyth; forwards, Kenns,
                            Hutton, Dougan, Hugginson, and Walsh.</p>
                        <p>There was only a moderate attendance of spectators. The Lancs, having won
                            the toss, Dougan started the ball arolling for the Skinshires. Play went
                            towards teh Lancs' custodian the backs relieving only for a moment
                            however, as Ireland came away again, Hutton sending past. On the
                            kick-off the Lancs' halves made ground. Casey the outside left got hold
                            of the sphere, and ran the entire length of the field, but before he had
                            time to shoot Branagh deprived him of the ball. Midfield play followed,
                            and Dougan got possession of the ball, and gave to Higginson, who,
                            dodging two opponents, gave to Walsh, who sent in a shot which was well
                            saved. The Lancs' keeper was getting plenty to do. Some pretty passing
                            was seen between the Lancs' forwards, and a visit was paid to Howlett,
                            who saved in smart style. The Green and Buff Brigade now got away per
                            Hutton, who gave to Kenna. The latter centered well. Higginson snatching
                            up the pass banged in the first goal for the Inniskillings. On resuming
                            the Inniskillings had play all in their favour. The Lancs' possess a
                            gold team but Casey, their outside left, should pass oftener. Walsh and
                            Higginson were playing a steady game. The new recruit, Kenna, is not bad
                            and he deserves another trial. Nothing of importance occurred up to half
                            time, the score standing:</p>
                        <p>Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers ... ... 1 good</p>
                        <p>Lancashire Fusiliers... ... ... ... Nil</p>
                        <p>The second half was opened by Blank kicking off for the Lancs, who at
                            once made towards Howlett, Wescot sending in a "beauty" which was saved
                            in grand style. Touch was now the order for some time, until Wescot got
                            away and he sent in strongly to goal. The ball struck the inside of the
                            bar and bounded out of Howlett's reach in the net, making the scores
                            equal. The pace after this was hot. The Inniskillings advanced per
                            Dougan, who centered well to Walsh, who handed the sphere. The free kick
                            helped the Lancs wall up. But overeagerness spoiled all attempts. The
                            Irishmen now got agoing, Higginson indulging in some tricky work along
                            with Walsh, and the pair of them made rings around the Lancs' defence.
                            The Lancs now stole a march. Casey got a splendid chance to give his
                            side the lead, but he shot yards wide. Still another chance was offered
                            him to score, but he dallied on the ball and Ward robbed him and punted
                            down field. The Lancs now made another effort to pierce Howlett's
                            charge, but all to no purpose as Howlett saved in his usual style. The
                            Inniskillings now took play in hand, Hutton and Kenny combining well.
                            The latter centred well across the goal mouth. Higginson, who was lying
                            handy, caught the sphere, and running through all opposition, he sent
                            the ball into the left low corner of the net, making the score 2 to one
                            in favour of the Inniskillings. on resuming the Lancs attacked in rare
                            fashion, but Ward relieved and teh Inniskillings once more attacked,
                            Walsh having hard lines is not scoring. Play now went in favour of the
                            Inniskillings, whose play was really worth watching. Play was in Lancs'
                            quarters when the referee's whistle sounded for full time, leaving the
                            108th again victorious by the following score:</p>
                        <p>Royal Inniskillings Fusiliers ... ... 2 goals</p>
                        <p>Lancashire Fusiliers... ... ... ... 1 goal</p>

                    <p>Our Treacherous Climate Prostrates the Weak Ones. </p>
                    <p>A Víctim' who collapsed through Loss of Strength, Back Pains</p>
                    <p>and Aggravated Indigestion, tolls of his completo cure by</p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. </p>
                    <p>"When I first settled down in England ti study your language and commerce,"
                        said Mr Louis Duchesne, "I was in the best of health, but after being here a
                        few weeks I found that I was growing exceedingly weak, and this proved to be
                        the beginniag of a long and serious illness."</p>
                    <p>The British climate is so treacherous and changeable that few are able to
                        withstand its variations, and Mr. Duchesne's alarming experience should
                        serve as a timely warning te all who feel the change of the season in their
                        limbs, with sharp pains in the back, twinges of rhenatism, attacks of
                        dizziness and weak ness, and a general disturbance of health. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Louis Duchesne, who is the son of a well known merchant in Paris, pursues
                        his studies at La Rochelle, The Drive, Tonbridge, Kent, at which address a
                        reporter of the Kent anl Sugsex Courier found him and obtained the following
                        details : </p>
                    <p>"I am very fond of cricket," he stated, "and it was while at practice that I
                        felt the first warnings that led to my breakdown of health I had sharp,
                        cutting pains across my back, and I felt that all my strength had suddenly
                        vanished. I bad to give up play because of the agony when I stooped and the
                        alarming weak ness that overcame me. </p>
                    <p>"My back got worse and worse. When I arose in the morning I was quito
                        unrefreshed by sleep; I felt, indeed, more tired than wher I went to bed,
                        and it was hard work to dress, Throughout the day I was languid and tool no
                        interest in anything. My head ached, my eyes were heavy, there was a most
                        unpleasan taste in my mouth, and I began to notici a tightness across my
                        chest. Besides, I was really very weak, felt cold and trembled con
                        siderably. Then for days together I had no hunger, or, as you call it, no
                        appetite. But around my heart I had much pain and a very uncomfortable
                        feeling. The heavy dull pain in my head would not allow me to study; I felt
                        dizzy when I moved about, and could not fix my thoughts on work. In fact, I
                        was utterly wonn out. </p>
                    <p>"My weakness increased, and each day suffered torments after even the
                        lightest of meals; I lost weight rapidly for want o nourishment So finally I
                        went home to Paris and explained liny sufferings to my parents They took me
                        to clever physicians, and I had much: medicine, but it was all in vain. In
                        January I met a friend who remarked how ill looked and advised me to try Dr.
                        Williams Pink Pills for Pale People. I was so impressed with all he told me
                        about these pills that I began to take them. At the end of three weeks I
                        knew that they had done a great deal for me. I felt quite different in
                        health, and so much stronger that I could eat well and without any suffering
                        after. I enjoyed meals, and soon Cagained all my lost weight and strength.
                        Now I sleep well, my head is free from aches, my brain always clear, and
                        feel scròng and active. I study without difficulty and can honestly say that
                        I am perfectly well and that my cure was accomplished by Dr. Williams' Pink
                        Pil!s." </p>

                    <head>PROSPECTUS.</head>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purpose set out in its Memorandum of
                        Association; to carry on business in Eypt and the Sudan, and more
                        particularly to develop the well-known health resort of Helouan, near Cairo,
                        by the acquisition of Land and Building sites, and by the erection of
                        Buildings thereon, and generally with the object of acquiring interests of
                        divers kinds in this rapidly improving district. </p>
                    <p>Although facilities for the acquisition of properties in Helogan will it is
                        believed be afforded the Directors, yet no existing or proposed contracts to
                        be entered into by the Co. on its inception are in force. </p>
                    <p>It is unnecessary to point out the paramount position held by Helouan as a
                        health and pleasare resort, as the fame of its curative mineral springs and
                        delightful climatic conditions are so well known and appreciated. But what
                        is interesting to know, from a commercial point of view, is that the rapid
                        growth of Helouan has attracted the attention of investors to the
                        opportunities that now offer for the remunerative employment of capital in
                        its development.</p>
                    <p>Helogan is situate about 16 miles from Cairo, and is connected by the
                        Egyptian Delta. Light Railways, Limited, the directors of which are 80 alive

                        expend £60,000 in improving this branch of their lipn. The line to Tourah
                        was recently doubled, thas accelerating the communication and enabling the
                        Company, to put on a frequent service of Express Trains, (the journey
                        oocupying about 30 minutes). The passenger service has already been equipped
                        with luxurious modern corridor carriages fitted with Electric Light. </p>
                    <p>Helouan is becoming increasingly popular as a residential district for Cirt
                        professional and business men, and a growing demand is apparent for more
                        improved and commodious habitations than at present exist. </p>
                    <p>The yearly influx of visitors steadiliy paes, hotel and other residential
                        establishments are feeling the tax on their resource to adaquately meet the

                    <p>The Golf Links, Racecourse, Paddock, Racing Stables, etc., are important
                        attractions, and the surroundings afford the most enjoyable place for horse

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                    <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
