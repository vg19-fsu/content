                    <head>MR. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM ON MOROCCO.</head>
                    <p>"Owing to the lamentable neglect of all his duties by the present Sultan came
                        the Algeciras Conference. At it the French were given, if not actually, at
                        least by inference, power to keep order in <placeName>Morocco</placeName>.
                        Had they but done so during the year that followed all would have been well,
                        and what is going on in <placeName>Casa Blanca</placeName> had never taken
                        place," writes Mr. RB. Cunninghame Graham in the "Clarion."</p>
                    <p>"Instead of pushing in at once with the force of international police, which
                        the Conference had decreed was to be raised, they did nothing in particular.
                        That is, the Quai d'Orsay did not move; but, on the other hand, hundreds of
                        undesirables and the off-scourings of <placeName>Algeria</placeName> swarmed
                        in like locusta, giving themselves the airs of conquerors, and bringing not
                        only their own countrymen but all the other Europeans into contempt. It
                        should not be forgotten that the Mohammedans are the Eastern Puritana, and
                        that the Arabe of Morocco all belong to the strictest sect (the Maleki) of
                        the whole Mussulmanic world. Though their religion no more influences the
                        majority of them than Christianity influences the majority of Christians (as
                        far as I can see), yet they have prejudices quite as irradicable as are our
                        own. All this has nothing to do with the French consuls and diplomatists, an
                        excellent and highly-educated class of men.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the murder of Dr. Mauchamp, whom he describes as "French Advance
                        Agent," Mr. Cunninghame Graham concludes that Mauchamp was paid by the
                        French Government to advance the cause of France amongst the Moors, the
                        French ambition being to "join their flats between the
                            <placeName>Senegal</placeName> and <placeName>Tripoli</placeName>, and
                        that when he erected poles over his house the Moorish merchants believed
                        wireless telegraphy would be used to control the markets over their heads,
                        and to put up the price of foreign goods, and at the same time lower the
                        price of wool, grain, and hides, which all of them export</p>
                    <p>"One thing seems pretty certain, concludes the writer, "that is, Morocco will
                        be unsafe for Europeans for several years come. At Masagan, Laraché, and
                        Rabat the position of the European colonies must perilous, few in number as
                        they are, and far-removed from help, and it is to be devoutly hoped that the
                        French and Spansish troops now occupying <placeName>Casa Blanca</placeName>
                        will not by needless severity (after the fighting) light a fire of hatred
                        which will be quenched in the blood of other Europeans, both up and down the
                        coast.</p>
                    <p>"The example has been sharp, and effect was wanted for during the past two
                        years the Moors have shown themselves arrogant and intolerant to a degree.
                        Still, it should never be forgotten that they are their native land, and
                        none of them, as far as I know ever came to <placeName>Roubaix</placeName>
                        or <placeName>Marseilles</placeName>, and set up harems there against the
                        will and prejudices of the natives of those towns. Still less did any of
                        them preach Islam about the streets, or shove a Frenchman into the gutter as
                        they passed saying be was a dirty Christian dog, and that in his own
                        land."</p>
                    <p>"These forward movements of so called civilised Powers," "always have a
                        disturbing influence on my mind and raise interesting and difficult ethical
                        questions. Whether it is called annexation, a protectorate, or peaceful
                        penetration, the process is always the same and equally objectionable to the
                        people annexed, protected, or penetrated. We annexed the Transvaal, we
                        protect Egypt, the Japanese are protecting Korea, the French are penetrating
                            <placeName>Morocco</placeName>. In every case I must confess to more
                        than a sneaking sympathy with the poor people who are fighting for their own
                        country, their own customs, their own religion, and their own laws."</p>

                            importance at least from the aspect of price. It has sold seven feddans,
                            at LE. 100 and it appears this land is not the most valuable which the

                    <head>BRITISH ORANGE TRADE.<lb/>THE EGYPTIAN "OVAL".</head>
                    <p>The announcement from Spain that larger orange crop than ever will have to he
                        distributed in the British markets during the coming season is interesting,
                        taken it conjunction with the official figures recently issued, showing the
                        enormous imports of oranges generally during the past year. The latter now
                        amount to 5,000,000 package containing over 1,250,000,000 single fruits. Of
                        this great total, more than 4,600,000 packages came from Spain alone, whilst
                        those from British Possessions only consisted of 116,000 packages, made up
                        chiefly of West Indian fruits.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of British oranges consists of the ordinary round-shaped fruits,
                        few, after all, of the higher-priced, oval-shaped fruits entering our ports.
                        It is impossible to state the exact quantity Britain receives of the latter,
                        but it gets 20,000cwt. from America, consisting of Californian seedless
                        oranges. The oval Jaffa supplies are merged in those tabulated from Turkey,
                        which consist of over 300,000 packages. The official figures appear to show
                        that oranges in Australia, so far as the export trade is concerned, have
                        proved a disappointment. Possibly this is due to the high expense of inland
                        and ocean transit.</p>
                    <p>The "Standard" states that in coming years the oval Egyptian orange is
                        destined to come well to the fore in the British markets. The fruit is very
                        large and juicy excelling those from California. Large quantities of trees
                        have been planted during recent years and are making much progress. Egyptian
                        planters of these mammoth fruits claim that they will be able to dominate
                        the trade in oval oranges in the British markets presently. The soil of
                        Egypt is particularly suitable for the finest oranges that can be grown.</p>

                            Lord Cromer's claim to national recognition of his public services. "If
                            we measure these services by money reward," said Sir Edward, "I think
                            the country must agree that the grant is a very moderate one"- a
                            conclusion that the House generally cordially endorsed. Mr. MacNeill and
                            a few Labour members and Radicals noisily demurred, but realising that
                            they were in a hopeless minority in their protestations they refrained

                            and the proportion they bore to the number registered.</p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey-From information supplied by the Egyptian Ministry of
                            Finance, it would appear that the share and debenture capital of the
                            companies whose business is entirely, or almost entirely, confined to
                            Egypt is estimated approximately at 90 millions sterling, of which the
                            proportion contributed by Egyptian companies is about two thirds, the
                            remaining one third representing the capital of foreign companies. These
                            figures afford no indication of the proportion of native and foreign
                            capital invested in these companies, the capital of Egyptian companies
                            being largely held abroad, and vice versa. It is estimated, however,
                            that the larger proportion of the total is in foreign hands. The Capital
                            is distributed among some 220 companies, about 45 per cent of which are
                            Egyptian, and the remainder foreign companies. There are also a certain
                            number of banking and other foreign companies which have established
                            branches in Egypt, but with respect to which it is not possible to
                            ascertain the amount of capital invested in the country. Foreign
                            companies are not registere in Egypt. I should add that the above

                        piece goods have improved during the last few weeks. Stocks are being
                        reduced, and within a short time it is expected that more buying will take
                        place in Manchester. Last winter was very severe in the Levant, and
                        considerably interfered with business. The season is just now commencing,

                        market. As to the Egyptian difficulties, it is reported that some of the
                        creditors involved are not agreeing easily to the proposals made at the
                        meetings recently held. Certain firms are understood to contend that the
                        period during which payments would be made is too long, and also that
                        interest should be paid. As improved reports have been received from Cairo
                        it is hoped that the difficulties in the way of agreement are not
                        insuperable.</p>

                    <p>Aden, <date when="1907-08-22">August 22</date>.</p>
                    <p>The Yemen representatives who proceeded to Constantinople have now arrived at
                        Hodeida, in company with Thabet Pasha, Hoosni Pasha and others. I see in one
                        of the Cairo Arabic papers that these representatives have taken with them
                        decorations and a large sum of money, not less than £50,000 to be
                        distributed amongst the chiefs of the tribes. As I have already stated in a
                        previous letter these representatives are all Turkish subjects, and with the
                        exception of two or three who are Turkish officials, they are all of the
                        common people. They have no influence with the Imam or his followers, nor do
                        they command their confidence. Nor is their representative character
                        unquestionable. They were nominated by Turkish officials. They do not
                        represent the intelligent element of the population, and nothing can be
                        expected from this deputation except the furtherance of their personal
                        interests. The real misfortune of Yemen is, as is clear from the Soltan's
                        speech published in the "Egyptian Gazette," that the Sultan is still in the
                        dark as to the real causes of the Yemen troubles.</p>
                    <p>There is no hope of pacifying Yemen by presents any more than there is by
                        introducing reforms which stand no chance of being carried out by the hands
                        of bad officials. The weak policy of Turkey is, if not mainly, to some
                        extent, responsible for the present power of the Imam. He is regarded by his
                        followers as a national hero, and every trumph is attributed by them to his
                        marvellous powers. This influence over his followances is supreme, and the
                        latters' belief in him only falls short of idolatory. The Imam's struggle is
                        really one for supremacy and his demand for autonomy on account of Turkish
                        oppression is merely a stepping-stone. That he is of the prophet's blood and
                        comes from an aristocratic family of the Imains who ruled Yemen for many
                        centuries before the advent of the Turks, goes without saying. It is,
                        however, beyond the ken of this letter to enter into the causes of the Yemen
                        tronbles or the claims of the Imam. What I propose to do in this letter is
                        to give a passing notice to a characteristic feature of the shortsighted and
                        suicidal policy pursued by the Turks in the Yemen campaign.</p>
                    <p>While Turkey has been lavishly expending money and men in order to crush the
                        rebellion, she has been disregarding the really dangerous aspect of the
                        Yemen situation, but for which the rebels' powers for mischief would have
                        been comparatively insignificant. I refer to the traffic in arms and
                        ammunition carried on between Djibuti and Yemen, which has made Yemen a hot
                        bed of revolution, and made it impossible for Turkey or any other power to
                        pacify Yemen. A very large business is done in fire arms in Turkish Yemen
                        and large quantities are stored in godowers and are publicly sold in the
                        Beduin markets there, almost without let or hindrance on the part of Turkey
                        while the Iman has regular smugglers to keep him supplied with firearms.
                        There are more than ten lakhs who are armed with modern firearms. These
                        firearms are exported from Djibuti and imported at out of the way landing
                        places on the coast. There are many unguarded landing places on the coast
                        between Bab-el-Mandeb to Jeddah, at which such firearms are imported from
                        Djibuti, and although a Turkish gun-boat is employed to operate against
                        smugglers it is very seldom that seizures are made. Gun-boats cannot do much
                        to check the traffic in firearms. The shrewd smugglers use small boats for
                        the traffic. They load them at Djibuti and generally sail at night by
                        circuitous routes till they reach their destination. As soon as a Turkish
                        gun-boat is sighted by the smugglers, the latter throw the firearms
                        overboard and generally manage to do this at some convenient place where
                        they can salve or recover them. If actually caught in the act the smugglers
                        either smooth there way by money with the authorities, or have to fight for
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Even to the man in the street the indifferent attitude of the Turks to this
                        important factor in the situation appears to be anything but wise, since it
                        is folly to work at the pump and leave the leak open. To pacify Yemen
                        efforts must first be directed against these smugglers, and this traffic
                        must be checked. But to do this, efficiency, integrity, and a strict watch
                        over all the landing places on the coast of Yemen are required. To obtain
                        efficiency in checking smuggling, a large force must be kept in all the
                        landing places, from Bab el Mandeb to Jeddah.</p>
                    <p>As regards other events of the week, advices, from Yemen state that the
                        rebels had an engagement with the Turks in the Affar district which lies
                        about three days from Sana. Affar is a Turkish district not garrisoned. The
                        rebels attacked it, and following upon the scent, the Turks arrived at the
                        place, and a severe engagement took place, in which two chiefs of the Imam
                        were killed and third commander of the Imam was wounded. Full details have
                        not yet been received.</p>

                    <p>BUILDING &amp; BUILDING BYE-LAWS.</p>
                    <p>BY ROBERT WILLIAMS Y.R.I.B.A.</p>
                    <p>Tbe Inspectors of Buildings are called District Surveyors in London. These
                        gentlemen are all highly qualified men. They have to pass a searching
                        examination on the Building Act, construction and materials; they are also
                        all qualified architects holding the diploma of the Royal Institute of
                        British Architects. It is obvious that the men who are to supervise, in the
                        interests of the public, the work of practising architects, should hold the
                        highest possible qualifications. None of these officers of the Council are
                        allowed private practice. Before the creation of the London Council,
                        nineteen years ago, the District Surveyors were allowed to practice
                        privately; this the Council wisely abolished. Every District Surveyor is
                        appointed with the distinct understanding that he discontinues private
                        practice and by abolishing the office in some smaller districts and adding
                        them to less remunerative ones the posts were made sufficiently valuable in
                        themselves to attract good men. The fees range from £500 to £1,500 per
                        annum.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the practice of officials in Egypt and the acceptance of posts
                        and salaries outside, hear that an order has been given here forbidding such
                        practice in the future. The order will doubtless be honourably obeyed, for
                        it obvious that if, say, an official acts as an architect on his own account
                        and accepts a salary from the Municipality for supervising the works of
                        other architects and his own, he cannot do justice to both sides. Besides it
                        is clear that if a practitioner were to set up in Alexandria or elsewhere,
                        and private practice were allowed to officials. he would have to compete
                        with salaried men who could handicap him badly. The unfairness is surely
                        patent to all. The Municipality is therefore, to be congratulated on issuing
                        an order, as, I hear, prohibiting private practice by its officials. I hope
                        the order will be published, as it is highly important that the public
                        should know this.</p>
                    <p>PROCEDURE AS TO BUILDING NOTICES</p>
                    <p>On one occasion I was amused at the matter-of-course way in which a
                        proprietor regarded the supposed necessity for bribing. I need not mention
                        the place. A notice had to be given, when the following dialogue took
                        place:-</p>
                    <p>Proprietor, "So and So will go, he knows whom to bribe."</p>
                    <p>Architect. "No, he will not go. If a notice cannot be given and permission
                        obtained without a bribe then the whole town shall ring with denunciations
                        of the enormity."</p>
                    <p>The notice as I said before, should be as simple as possible. I cannot do
                        better than give section 145 dealing with notices in the London Building
                        Act:-</p>
                    <p>"Notices to be given to the (District) Surveyor by builder.</p>
                    <p>145. In the following cases and at the following times (that is to say):-</p>
                    <p>(a). Where a building or structure or work is about to be begin then two
                        clear days before it is begun; and</p>
                    <p>(b). Where a building or structure or work is after the commencement thereof
                        suspended for any period exceeding three months then two clear days before
                        it is resumed; and</p>
                    <p>(c). Where during the progress of a building, or structure, or work, the
                        builder employed thereon is changed, then two clear days before a new
                        builder enters upon the continuance thereof, the builder or other person
                        causing or directing the work to be executed shall serve on the District
                        Surveyor a building notice respecting the building or structure or work.
                        Every building notice shall state the situation, area, height, number of
                        storeys, intended use of the building or structure, the number of buildings
                        or structures if more than one, the particulars of the proposed work and the
                        name and address of the person giving the notice and those of the owner then
                        in possession of and the occupier of the building or structure or of its
                        site or intended site. All works in progress at the same time to, in or on
                        the same building or structure may be included in one building notice. No
                        plans are asked for, with the exception of the cases of special works or
                        public buildings.</p>
                    <p>The question of backsheesh is known to be a festering sore in Egypt. Other
                        countries are not free from it but here it has become a fine art. The
                        dealers in engineering goods and other hardware will tell you unblushingly
                        that backsheesh or commission as it is sometimes called has to be paid if
                        business is to be done. Of course the commission comes out of the pocket of
                        the person who buys. I was asked once by a builder what sum was to be put
                        for me in a contract sum. I was assured by the person who asked me that it
                        was the universal custom. "Whether it is customary or not," I replied, "it
                        is a mean dishonest practice and one which every member of the Royal
                        Institute of British Architects when he receives his diploma solemnly
                        affirms he will eschew. The penalty for an offence of his kind is
                        ignominious expulsion from the Institute." I need hardly say that I also
                        told my enquirer that my client always paid me for supervising the work of
                        the builder, and not the builder whom I supervised.</p>
                    <p>Now take a suppositionary case which will make the evil of elicit commissions
                        apparent. Suppose a man holding a post in the engineering or other
                        department of a public bodly at a fair salary which should command his whole
                        fair working time. Suppose also that he holds an appointment with a private
                        firm of engineers<cb n="5"/> at a salary, and suppose some engineering work
                        is ordered by the public body and that its management falls among the duties
                        of the doubly appointed gentleman. Will he casually think of his outside
                        firm in the matter? This is a suppositionary case which shows
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Of course if Maniecipalities do not pay officials sufficient salary on which
                        to live in decency then the men who accepts outside work are not to blame;
                        the blame then rests on the shoulders of the sweating poblic body. It
                        therefore behoves public bodies to put their servants and officials beyond
                        the reach of temptation and of backsheesh by paying their man a proper
                        living wage.</p>
                    <p>In England, the Prevention of Corruption Act has not become law without
                        occasion. Here is one of the most recent prosecutions under that act showing
                        how London trades men who give baksheesh are dealt with:—</p>
                    <p>A warehouseman of Barbican, London, was fined £10 and ten guineas costs,
                        under the Prevention of Corruption Act, for having tipped a carman, who was
                        also fined £1, or one day's imprisonment, for receiving the tips.</p>
                    <p>A drastic law of this kind would be good for Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As I am unable to conclude these articles in this issue there will be one
                        more dealing with work in Alexandria generally.</p>

                    <head>SWANSEA EISTEDDFOD.</head>
                    <p>The Eisteddfod which is being held this year at Swansea, is attracting large
                        crowds to that town. The Gorsedd ceremony was unusually attractive, Sir
                        Norman Lockyer being initiated into the Gorsedd circle.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>EGYPT AND THE CELTS.</head>
                    <p>Sir Norman Lockyer, as a British bard, traced the Gorsedd back over four
                        thousand years. On being initiated into the mystic circle of British
                        Berdism, he said he had been much impressed because three or four years ago
                        he had visited Egypt to study ancient monuments, and he found that there
                        were there worshippers of the sun and stars who, in anticipation of the
                        Welsh Gorsedd, appointed temples to the sun and next to the northern stars.
                        He also went to Cornwall to study the circles there, and upon careful
                        examination they were found generally to consist of a dozen stones. He made
                        a map of them, and to his great astonishment he found that the directions Of
                        these stones were identical with the direction of the Egyptian temples. If
                        he were allowed to express the opinion he had arrived at after a
                        considerable amount of work, he was convinced that the Welsh Gorsedd, the
                        circle with the oustanding stones, was the distinct descendant, almost
                        without a break, of those citcles which he examined with such care in
                        Cornwall.</p>
                    <p>In the evening the annual meeting of the joint associations of the Gorsedd
                        and Eisteddfod was held under the presidency of the Archdruid. The chief
                        business was to determine the town to be honoured by the Eisteddfod two
                        years hence, the first year after the new Reform Bill will have became
                        Bardic Law. Four towns competed for the honour— <placeName>Llandrindod
                            Wells</placeName>, <placeName>Aberystwyth</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Carmarthen</placeName>, and <placeName>London</placeName>.
                        Three ballots had to be taken before the final decision was arrived at,
                        London ultimately defeating Carmarthen by only four votes in a crowded
                        house.</p>

                    <head>BURGLARY AT RAMLEH.</head>
                    <p>A peculiarly impudent and daring burglary occurred yesterday morning at a
                        house immediately facing the Sporting Club station, on the Ramleh line, by
                        which an English gentleman, while occupied in business in the city, was
                        robbed of all his clothing save that which he was wearing. The burglar must
                        have enteted the house between 9am. and midday and it is a notable fact that
                        the only room from which anything was stolen was the bedroom of the
                        gentleman to whom we refer.</p>
                    <p>It is thought that on going to market the servant of the house left the
                        window open and that an entrance was effected with ease, but suspicion also
                        rests upon the servant himself. A few nights ago, however, the two gentlemen
                        occupying the house, had reason to prevent two Berberins from molesting a
                        lady and gentlemen, who had been picnicing on the sands, and the police are
                        now inclined to think that these two suspicious characters are guilty of the
                        robbery, and not improbably are trying to make a living out of the few who
                        happen to select the district for a moonlight stroll either singly or in
                        company with one or two.</p>
                    <p>The fact, however, that the burglary was committed in the fall light of day,
                        from a room whose window looks direct upon the station, that entrance and
                        exit were apparently made through the window, that it happened unobserved
                        during the busiest part of the day, in full view of houses in the course of
                        construction, is most remarkable. Ou étaient nos bons chaouiches</p>

                                the "Jena" disaster as due to the spontaneous combustion of B
                                powder, but that in reality the direct cause of the disasters in the
                                navy was the lack of cooperation and antagonism existing in the
                                various branches of the service. It censures the naval artillery
                                authorities for remissness in fixing the responsibility, and
                                condemns the administrative for the anarchy prevailing. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS. The King's Speech from the Throne states that "My

                                with the desire to contribute to the maintenance of peace. I have
                                concluded an agreement with Spain to preserve our respective
                                interests in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. I trust that the Hague
                                Conference will result in agreements tending to mitigate the evils

                                the Orange River Colony will conduce to the welfare and contentment
                                of its people.</p>

                    <p>An interesting White Paper was issued on Saturday in the form of a report by
                        Sir Bidon Gorst and Mr. Llewellyn Smith on the system of British commercial
                        attachés und commercial agents. The report, which is dated <date
                            when="1907-07-06">6th July</date> and addressed to Sir Edward Grey,
                        Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, is as follows :-</p>
                    <p>Sir—In accordance with instructions, we have examined the question whether
                        the results derived trom the past expenditure on commercial attachés and
                        commercial agents have been such as to warrant the continuance of the system
                        now in force, and we have the honour the report as follows :—</p>
                    <p>The defects of the present system may be summed up as follows :—The
                        commercial attaché, though attached to a Diplomatic Mission, has no regular
                        career or prospect of advancement within the Diplomatic Service. He cannot,
                        of course, be an expert in any particalar industry, still less in all though
                        he may be expected to possess a good general knowledge of trade conditions
                        in the countries were he serves and to be familiar with their languages. It
                        is, however, equally necessary that he should be well acquainted with
                        industrial developments in his own country and in touch with the more
                        important branches of British manufacture. He should also be close in touch
                        with the Departments of the Home Government dealing with commercial matters.
                        Long and continuous residence in a foreign country is not, however,
                        favourable to the attainment of these objects. Again, in the Missions which
                        are the head quarters of a commercial attaché there is a tendency to devolve
                        on him all the current commercial work. He thus becomes one of the ordinary
                        staff, his absence from headquarters causes inconvenience and is not
                        encouraged, and his visits to commercial and industrial centres within his
                        district, which should be the most instructive part of his duties, grow few
                        and far between.</p>
                    <p>Again, the appointment of special officials to deal with commercial questions
                        deprives the staff of the Diplomatic Missions to which they are attached of
                        much valuable experience and training in this branch of their work, and in a
                        general way conveys the impression to the younger members of the Diplomatic
                        Service that subjects connected with trade are too technical for their
                        comprehension and altogether beyond their scope. The secretaries are not,
                        therefore, in the earlier stages of their career properly grounded in the
                        details of commercial work, though this work must necessarily become one of
                        their chief preoccupations when they rise to the charge of a mission. The
                        duties of commercial agents have never been strictly defined. They consist
                        in watching and reporting on the commerce, industries and products of
                        special districts and in answering inquiries on commercial subjects. The
                        expectation that British firms would utilise their services for the purpose
                        of conducting special inquiries at a distance has not been realised. A large
                        number of applications for commercial information have, however, received
                        attention. The present arrangements for commercial agents are entirely
                        temporary and provisional, and we can see no reason why their functions
                        should not be equally well discharged by the Consular staff, strengthened
                        where necessary for the purpose. With a view of obviating the deffects
                        pointed out above and of providing foundation for a more efficient system,
                        we have the honour to make the following recommendations:-</p>
                    <p>1) The existing commercial attachés residing in European capitals, including
                        the present commercial agent in Russia, who should be made a commercial
                        attaché, to have their headquarters London, and to divide their time between
                        special investigations abroad, partiularly in districts of interest to
                        British manufacturers, work in the Board of Trade or the Commercial
                        Department of the Foreign Office and visits to manufacturing districts in
                        the United Kingdom. This measure would not be applied to the commercial
                        attaché at Paris, as it would not be practicable to make any change in the
                        position of Sir H.A. Lee, who holds the dual appointment of commercial
                        attaché and resident British director of the Suez Canal Company in Paris. We
                        think that, in view of the very wide areas which are at present assigned to
                        commercial attachés, it would not be appreciably more inconvenient that they
                        should start on their travels from London than from some centre within those
                        districts, while the value of their inquiries would be very greatly
                        increased if definitely directed to special objects by instructions from the
                        Department or from the Commercial Intelligence Committee, or by the
                        experience gained in systematic visits to British commercial centres. An
                        additional advantage would be that it would be unnecessary to define rigidly
                        the districts to be covered by each commercial attaché, who might be
                        directed from time to time to travel in any country with whose language he
                        was acquainted.</p>
                    <p>2) The commercial attachés at the more distant posts and in the countries
                        where special qualifications other than commercial are the chief
                        requirements, such as Turkey, China, &amp;c., to continue to have their
                        headquarters in those countries, but to be relieved so far as possible of
                        the current commercial work at the Embassies and Legations, to be required
                        to move about freely within their districts, and to pay periodical visits on
                        duty to the principal centres of industry in this country, and to the
                        Departments charged with commercial matters. These visits ought, we think,
                        to be annual in the case of the commercial attaché at Con<cb n="4"
                        />stantinople, and at least biennial in that of the commercial attachés in
                        the Far East.</p>
                    <p>(3) The present temporary arrangements for commercial agents to be
                        discontinued, and the functions now performed by these agents to be assigned
                        to the members of the Consular service, which must be increased in places
                        where the commercial work necessitates such a course. It is clear that,
                        owing to the increase of commercial inquiry at New York, the Consulate
                        General cannot dispense with an extra officer, and that a salaried Consular
                        officer would be required in Switzerland to take the place of Mr.
                        Milligan.</p>
                    <p>(4) The current commercial business of the Diplomatic Missions, including
                        many of the duties hitherto carried out by the commercial attachés, to be in
                        charge of a specially selected member of the diplomatic staff, designated by
                        the head of the missién and receiving a special allowance whilst actually
                        discharging his functions. It is estimated that an annual sum of £1,000
                        would cover the necessary expenditure. It is important that the member of
                        the staff selected for this purpose should while so acting, have some
                        distinctive title such as "Secretary in charge of commercial matters," so
                        that the commercial community may clearly realise that there is a special
                        officer in each mission with whom they can communicate direct on commercial
                        questions.</p>

                        <p>The past week has been somewhat remarkable in banking and financial
                            circles for the large discount business which has been done by the Bank
                            of England. To such an extent was this carried on, that fears were enter
                            tained in many quarters that a farther rise in the Bank rate would
                            result. This however has not happened and the rate remains at 44 per
                            cent as fixed on the <date when="1907-08-15">15th of this month</date>,
                            the excellent Bank position being almost sufficient of itaelf to obviate
                            an increase. Since the date of the last return
                                <measure>£225,000</measure> in gold has been received from abroad,
                            the stock of coin and bullion has increased by
                                <measure>£981,749</measure>, and the note circulation has been
                            reduced by <measure>£75,275</measure>, thus making an addition to the
                            reserve of <measure>£1,057,024</measure>, making the total
                                <measure>£26,015,965</measure>. The difficulty which Lombard Street

                            some portion of their deposits consists of Japanese money, and the
                            Japanese Government will require large sums to meet the 10 millions of 6

                        <p>Almost daily comes the rumour that "liquidation has ceased" but there
                            does not seem to be any large increase of buying, and prices remain
                            practically unchanged. Evidences however of a little investment buying
                            are noticeable, particularly in the Home Railway Section, but the
                            outside public is still holding aloof, and until it comes in more
                            generally there is little chance of any immediate improvement taking
                            place. The position in New York appears to be improving and as a
                            consequence a more cheerful tone is being adopted. This is materially
                            helped by the decision of the Directors of the Bank of England with
                            regard to the Bank rate.</p>

                        <p>Conasols continue to occupy the attention of a number of financiers who
                            seem to be of the opinion that the former popularity of Consols would be

                            monies which it borrows, the Banks, by issuing notes can borrow large
                            sums without interest. The fact seems to be altogether overlooked that
                            at the price of 82 Consols are only on a 3 per cent level, and as long
                            as there are a large number of first rate investments both in this
                            country and abroad which offer a higher rate of interest—if not an equal
                            security—the price of our gilt-edged stock is hardly likely to advance
                            much. Fractional gains have been made during the past week, and the

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
