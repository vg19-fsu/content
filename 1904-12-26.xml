                        property, all these are with us and we hope will be with us to the end of
                        the chapter, but who is to forecast the price of cotton in thirty years from
                        to-day or to guarantee us for all time against rival exporters! We have
                        nothing but praise for the sober and moderate attitude of this Note in
                        dealing with large questions of finance. Mr. Vincent Corbett sees far more
                        clearly than some of the native critics of the administration that, to use
                        an analogy, there is no reason for a man who has just paid off all his
                        youthful debts, acquired a steady income, and won the respect and trust of
                        his neighbours by his honesty and method, to celebrate the payment of the
                        last bill dating from some twenty years back by an orgie of
                        extravagance.</p>
                    <p>We hope to discuss the Note fully in the near future. One point more
                        remains-to | bestow well-merited praise both on its manner and, may we say,
                        its manners. The style is masterly and incisive ; there are no rhetorical
                        flourishes, and while readers may disagree with its criticisms or its reply
                        to their own criticisms, they cannot be hurt, be they ever 80 thin-skinned.
                        We have our selves expressed opinions which the Financial Adviser combats in
                        his present Note, and we admire not only the skill of his dialectio but the
                        perfect courtesy of his criticism. Reports emanating from other Ministries
                        have been known to fail in this respect owing to the inability of their
                        writers to realise the fact that rapier play, thoughts ceremony may seem
                        punctilious and absurd, is altogether more graceful and effective than
                        bludgeonwork.</p>

                    <head>SUEZ CANAL II. </head>
                    <p>Sir Theodore Angier has a good deal to do yet before he gets his second Suez
                        Canal. It seeing to be clear that the directors of the present canal -as is
                        the way of monopolistshave not treated customers with the considera tion
                        which might be expected. In defiance of the agreement of 1883, they have
                        increased the dividend beyond 15 per cent.--to 26, in point of fact--without
                        first reducing the tonnage dues to 5 francs. At the same time, the building
                        of another canal seems a somewhat extreme remedy. It would cost, on the
                        lowest computation, six millions ; and though Sir Theodore asserts that the
                        traffic would be "simply doubled," not everyone will share his airy cor
                        fidence. It does not always follow that because you cut a second door in a
                        room, twice as many people will pass in and out as when there was only one.
                        Most formidable of all is the concession difficulty. It is extremely
                        unlikely that the Egyptian Governinent would permit, or would be permitted
                        to permit, the construo. tion of another canal side by side with the
                        first.</p>

                        INJURED.</head>
                    <p>(From Our CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Keneh, December 25. The sleeping and restaurant car train, which was due at
                        Keueh at 7 a.m. to-day, has only just arrived, nine hours late owing to a
                        collision at Kafr Ammar.</p>
                    <p>We learn from a reliable, and in fact official, source the following details
                        concerning the collision which occurred at Kafr Ammar on "Xmas Eve :</p>
                    <p>The 6.30 Luxor train, which had fortunately slowed down before passing
                        through the station, where it does not stop, ran straight into + a slow
                        train which was standing beside the platform. Fortanately, any great loss of
                        life was averted by the fact that the tourists, many of whom were on the
                        train, had just left the dining-car and that a crate and luggage van was
                        interposed between the engine and the above-mentioned car.</p>
                    <p>The loss of life was greatly exaggerated in l. Cairo on Saturday night,
                        rumours being current that from 30 to 60 persons had been killed or
                        seriously injured. As a matter of fact, I. the cook's assistant, an Arab,
                        who had beer' : five years in the company's service, and who leaves several
                        children, was the only victim.</p>
                    <p>Two cases of severe injuries are reported. The chef, Mr. E. Batfiglia, who
                        was standing near his assistant at the time of the collision, was thrown
                        down with such' violence that one of his legs was broken. He was also
                        injured by the splinters and fragments of the fore part of the dining car,
                        which was completely wrecked, and burnt and scalded owing to the overturning
                        of the dining-car boiler and cooking arrangements. Mr. Disertis, the maitre
                        d'hotel, La was severely bruised and shaken, and has been sent to
                        Alexandria, where he lives.</p>
                    <p>Of the passengers, about a dozen were more or less shaken and bruised.
                        Several of them describe the shock as having been terrific. All the lights
                        in the train went out, and al. terrible crash was heard. Fortunately the le
                        passengers kept their heads and there seems to have been no panic.</p>
                    <p>Immediately on the receipt of the news in Cairo, a special breakdown train
                        proceeded to le the scene of disaster, conveying Major, L'Estrange
                        Johustone, Scander Pasta Febmy, 11 Mr. Trevithick, Mr. Hood,' and several
                        other li railway ofhcials, with Drs. Murison and li Schameil. · The Luxor
                        train was able to start at mid-li night on its journey South.</p>
                    <p>-As for the material damage done, the diving car is &amp; total wreck, two
                        brake and baggage vans have also been wrecked. Both locomotives are badly
                        damaged, and two or more fish waggons have sustained considerable
                        damage.</p>
                    <p>An enquiry into the cause of the accident will begin to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>We may point out that it is just at Kafr | Ammar that the double line ceases,
                        the work of doubling the line from Luxor being still in progress south of
                        this point.</p>

                    <p>SCHEME FOR DEVELOPING TRADE.</p>
                    <p>Discussing a scheme for combination in the export trade of the United
                        Kingdom, a writer | I in Commercial Intelligence says :</p>
                    <p>No scheme yet devised to meet any evil can be inaugurated or carried through
                        to success without difficulties presenting themselves. We may, however,
                        sketch briefly, what is in our ! minds, and, as an example, we will take
                        Egypt, It for instance, as an, imaginary field for our enterprise. What
                        would apply to that country would apply with equal force to a dozen others.
                        1 &amp;</p>
                    <p>To sells goods it is necessary to put them | before buyers. To slowly develop
                        a trade cata logues serve a useful purpose ; samples also are useful, but
                        they touch only the fifinge of the question, and being in nearly every /
                        case explained in the English language, thøy are understandable only by the
                        recognised whole sale, and importing houses, who already have their
                        arrangeinents with other countries and are unwilling to disturb them. These
                        houses N are there to make a profit, and they make it, and it is only common
                        sense that they should prefer to abide by the existing conditions which are
                        working well, rather than bring new ones into being in which there may be no
                        profit. This vested interest which knows and understands international
                        trading is, therefore, settled in its operations. The English manuIfacturer
                        must go direct to the retail buyers, and the must approach them in their own
                        language, under their buying conditions, and be in the position of a local
                        house. Competent travellers and managers with linguistic attainments are,
                        therefore, necessary, and these, cost money.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, propose trading corporations. Let an Anglo-Egyptian Trade
                        Corporation be formed with, say, &amp; capital of £10,000, £5,000 of which
                        might be by way of debentures placed with those who show their Sympathy with
                        the movement and the remainder in shares taken up by manufacturers willing
                        and desirous of extending their foreign trade. We will say that ten
                        manufacturers provide £500 each, or twenty manufacturers $250 each.
                        Increased prices, commensurate with the trouble and expense involved, could
                        easily be obtained. The-Corporation would have competent directors in London
                        selected from the manufacturers interested to superintend the dispatch of
                        the goods; and competent directors in Egypt to control the reception of the
                        merchandise in bulk, and its distribution to customers, to invoice goods in
                        the currency of the country, and to collect the accounts when due. The
                        present difficulty in collecting foreign accounts is due to the lack of
                        facilities at the disposal of manufacturers rather than to the lack of
                        principle on the part of the customer. The manufacturer would de: Tliver to
                        a London warehouse where other</p>
                    <p>classes of goods would accumulate, and the packing could thus be carried on
                        in a most economical and busiriesslike way. Nothing but goods of British
                        origin would be handled. The management in Egypt would procure merchandise
                        from the Egyptian producers for the English market, making advances (in
                        conjunction with a bank) against them where necessary, and ship them to
                        London for realisation, The buyers and sellers alike in Egypt would soon
                        gain confidence in the scheme, if controlled by capable men, because, while
                        developing English trade with Egypt, it would foster the Egyptian trade with
                        England. It would receive the sympathy of the Egyptian Government, and
                        possibly its support in the shape of Government contracts, by reason of the
                        assistance it would render to Egyptian interests. An effort of this kind to

                    <p>The Executive Committee having called attention to the very limited support
                        accorded by the British and American community, in the form of annual
                        subscriptions to the Anglo-American Hospital, the Ceneral Committee feel
                        convinced that the benefits conferred by such a Hospital bave only to be
                        understood to ensure the support necessary to place the institution on a
                        sound financial | basis. | The Hospital accommodation consists of 22 beds,

                    <p>The anthern "Sing O heavens,” by Berthold Tours, is a fine one and was well
                        rendered by the choir. The soprano solo was taken by Miss MunGavin. The
                        anthem closes with Hymn 59, "O come all ye faithful" in which the
                        congregation beartily joined. The carols, one of which was sung at the

                        At the morning service, Mrs. Cooper rendered very beautifully "He shall feed
                        His flock," while in the evening the solo la was taken by Mr. Agnew, who
                        sang "Nazareth.” li Carols were rendered by the choir at both. The li pastor
                        announced that at a meeting of the cou-li gregation last Friday the church
                        constitution was framed and the deacons and officers were i duly elected,
                        thus placing the Cairo Evangelical Free Church on a proper basis. He was
                        also happy to announce that the committee of the German Church, with the

                        <p> Helouan, despite the enormous number of visitors going up the river, is
                            holding its own well as a fashionable and popular tourist resort, and
                            has a larger number of visitors than it had during the corresponding
                            period last year. The Grand Hotel, the Tewfik Palace Hotel, and that
                            charming home of health, "Al Hayat," are all doing well. The Tewfik
                            Palace Hotel has at the present moment over fifty visitors. Among the
                            many distinguished tourists who are shortly coming to the Tewfik Palace,
                            is the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, who is due to arrive there from
                            Luxor on Monday next.</p>
                        <p>The feature of Helouan during the past week has been the encampment of
                            the Royal Engineers, who gave some excellent military sports on Saturday
                            last. They made use of the Helouan Sporting Club's grounds, the
                            grand-stand of which was filled with nearly three hundred persons,
                            representing the cream of Cairo society. Tea was served in the grand
                            lounge of the Tewfik Palace Hotel. The most interesting feature of the
                            event was the Veterans' Race, which was run in grand style by the
                            gallant soldier, General Frederick Lence, C.B., the well-known
                            Anglo-Indian mic litary man. General Lance is going to act as starter in
                            the forthcoming races, to be held by the Helouan Sporting Club on
                            Saturday next, the 31st inst.</p>
                        <p>A very important committee meeting of the Helouan Sporting Club was held
                            on Wednesday last at the Palace of Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha at Cairo.
                            The Prince is patron of the club and takes the greatest interest in its
                            welfare. Prince Abbas Halmi Pasha has lately joined the committee of the
                            club. It has been decided to hold trotting races twice a month. A
                            sub-committee of the club has been formed for the purpose of organising
                            these races. Dr. Bentley was unanimously elected secretary of this
                            subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>On Monday last the Delta Light Railway Company took over the Helouan
                            railway line and great things are expected by the inhabitants of Helouan
                            and the public of Cairo at this new departure. Many prominent
                            AngloEgyptian Government officials have declared that they will reside
                            in Helouan if the tacilities for communication with Cairo are increased
                            and improved.</p>
                        <p>New golf links have been recently made by the Tewfik Palace Hotel for the
                            benefit of the public, free of any charge. The grounds have been laid
                            out by Mr. Hastie, the celebrated golt professional, and should prove a
                            great boon to this popular resort</p>
                        <p>I notice that a great deal of work is being done to the Sporting Club's
                            grounds. The paddock is being enclosed with solid wooden railings.</p>
                        <p>Everything tends to show that Helouan is going to have a record season,
                            for this charming locality was never healthier or in better trim than it
                            is at present. Of course a great many improvements remain to be done,
                            but I am glad to state that the Tanzim Department of the Ministry of
                            Publio Works is awaking to its responsibilities, and that the articles
                            that have appeared in the Egyptian Gazette lately seem to have done some
                            good. But I hear on the best authority that no official financial grant
                            has as yet been accorded to the recent petition of the inhabitants of
                            Helonan, * The competition on the Helouan golf links to-day (Handicap v.
                            Bogey) was not so fully attended as had been anticipated, owing to the
                            number of players that were attracted from Helouan to the Cairo races.
                            In spite of that the handicap was well contested and some fair scores
                            were returned. On the eighteenhole course Mr. A. D. Macdonald won the
                            first prize with a 'two down' and was closely followed by Mr. Stewart
                            Fildes, the winner of last week, and Mr. H. Swift. Mr. H. R. Harrison.
                            who has in former years sent in some excellent scores, has only just
                            returned and was unfortunately not quite on his game.</p>
                        <p>In the nine-hole competition Mrs. PageMay played steady golf and by means
                            of some excellent approaching took first prize with a 'two down', being
                            ono notch better than Mrs. Jebb Scott and Miss Sargent, both redoubtable
                            opponents on these desert links. Mrs. Lye, Mrs. Macdonald, and Miss
                            Hobson among others were hard runners up.</p>

                            at this hotel had several visitors from Cairo and as some of the ladies

                        <p>Helouan, Dec. 24. Helouan, despite the enormous number of visitors going
                            up the river, is holding its own well as a fashionable and popular
                            tourist resort, and has a larger number of visitors than it had during
                            the corresponding period last year. The Grand Hotel, the Tewfik Palace
                            Hotel, and that charming home of health, "Al Hayat," are all doing well.
                            The Tewfik Palace Hotel has at the present moment over fifty visitors.
                            Among the many distinguished tourists who are shortly coming to the
                            Tewfik Palace, is the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, who is due to
                            arrive there from Luxor on Monday next.</p>
                        <p>The feature of Helouan during the past week has been the encampment of
                            the Royal Engineers, who gave some excellent military sports on Saturday
                            last. They made use of the Helouan Sporting Club's grounds, the
                            grand-stand of which was filled with nearly three hundred persons,
                            representing the cream of Cairo society. Tea was served in the grand
                            lounge of the Tewfik Palace Hotel. The most interesting feature of the
                            event was the Veterans' Race, which was run in grand style by the
                            gallant soldier, General Frederick Lence, C.B., the well-known
                            Anglo-Indian mic litary man. General Lance is going to act as starter in
                            the forthcoming races, to be held by the Helouan Sporting Club on
                            Saturday next, the 31st inst.</p>
                        <p>A very important committee meeting of the Helouan Sporting Club was held
                            on Wednesday last at the Palace of Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha at Cairo.
                            The Prince is patron of the club and takes the greatest interest in its
                            welfare. Prince Abbas Halmi Pasha has lately joined the committee of the
                            club. It has been decided to hold trotting races twice a month. A
                            sub-committee of the club has been formed for the purpose of organising
                            these races. Dr. Bentley was unanimously elected secretary of this
                            subcommittee.</p>
                        <p>On Monday last the Delta Light Railway Company took over the Helouan
                            railway line and great things are expected by the inhabitants of Helouan
                            and the public of Cairo at this new departure. Many prominent
                            AngloEgyptian Government officials have declared that they will reside
                            in Helouan if the tacilities for communication with Cairo are increased
                            and improved.</p>
                        <p>New golf links have been recently made by the Tewfik Palace Hotel for the
                            benefit of the public, free of any charge. The grounds have been laid
                            out by Mr. Hastie, the celebrated golt professional, and should prove a
                            great boon to this popular resort</p>
                        <p>I notice that a great deal of work is being done to the Sporting Club's
                            grounds. The paddock is being enclosed with solid wooden railings.</p>
                        <p>Everything tends to show that Helouan is going to have a record season,
                            for this charming locality was never healthier or in better trim than it
                            is at present. Of course a great many improvements remain to be done,
                            but I am glad to state that the Tanzim Department of the Ministry of
                            Publio Works is awaking to its responsibilities, and that the articles
                            that have appeared in the Egyptian Gazette lately seem to have done some
                            good. But I hear on the best authority that no official financial grant
                            has as yet been accorded to the recent petition of the inhabitants of
                            Helonan, * The competition on the Helouan golf links to-day (Handicap v.
                            Bogey) was not so fully attended as had been anticipated, owing to the
                            number of players that were attracted from Helouan to the Cairo races.
                            In spite of that the handicap was well contested and some fair scores
                            were returned. On the eighteenhole course Mr. A. D. Macdonald won the
                            first prize with a 'two down' and was closely followed by Mr. Stewart
                            Fildes, the winner of last week, and Mr. H. Swift. Mr. H. R. Harrison.
                            who has in former years sent in some excellent scores, has only just
                            returned and was unfortunately not quite on his game.</p>
                        <p>In the nine-hole competition Mrs. PageMay played steady golf and by means
                            of some excellent approaching took first prize with a 'two down', being
                            ono notch better than Mrs. Jebb Scott and Miss Sargent, both redoubtable
                            opponents on these desert links. Mrs. Lye, Mrs. Macdonald, and Miss
                            Hobson among others were hard runners up.</p>
                        <p>The band of the Royal Inniskillings 'discoursed sweet music' on the fine

                    <p>(Continued from page 5.)</p>
                    <p>PENSIONS. The Pension charge for 1905 reaches a total of L.E.425,000, or an
                        increase of L.E.9,000. The state of the pension laws is highly unsatis
                        factory: the charge is a heavy one, while the scale in some respects at
                        least is far from libe ral. The question is one that can only be dealt with,
                        as past failures show, with the utmost caution and after careful study. It
                        is occupying the attention of the Government.</p>
                    <p>OF INTEREST TO ALL. The following remarks will be of very general interest to
                        employés in business as well as in the Government Service :--</p>
                    <p>During the past year complaints have been made in almost every department of
                        the Government service that in view of the enor. mously increased cost of
                        living, the scale of salaries, fixed in days when life was cheaper, was
                        becoming increasingly inadequate. In the case of technical men such as
                        engineers, the Government had no choice but to grant an increase at once,
                        and the same has been done for the medical staff, and in some degree for the
                        judicial body; at what cost the above figures show. Not more than two or
                        three of the Europeans other than those just mentioned have had their pay
                        raised, but increase of business has necessitated some increase in
                        numbers.</p>
                    <p>Except in the police, the army, and to n| lesser extent in some other
                        departments, it has been impossible to do anything to improvo the pay ot
                        quite the lower class of employés. Rather piteous appeals have been received
                        from these and a Committee has been appointed to study the whole question
                        with a view of equalising the conditions obtaining in the different
                        Ministries, and recommending an increase where necessary. Their report will
                        be to hand early next year, and the Government will lose no time in taking
                        such steps as may be deemed advisable, but it must be borne in mind that
                        anything in the shape of an all-round increase of pay would be enormously
                        costly and that the Government funds åre not unlimited. Besides it is a fact
                        that can hardly be gainsaid that very many in the lower ranks of
                        officialdom, badly as they may be paid, are paid a good deal more than their
                        work is worth. In not a few of the Administrations increased pay ought
                        certainly not to be given unless increased efficiency is obtained in return.
                        Moreover, an all-round increase should, and indeed must, include not only
                        the smaller employés but also those of higher rank who, though receiving
                        salaries which look well on paper, are as a matter of fact more hardly hit
                        by the rise in the cost of living than some of those ho cry out the
                        loudest.</p>
                    <p>TORT OF ALEXANDRIA. In dealing with the extraordinary expendi ture chargeable
                        to the new Reserve Fund in 1905, the Adviser remarks :</p>
                    <p>The Port of Alexandria figures for a sum of L.E. 158,000, although within the
                        last four years considerably over L.E. 500,000 has been spent on it. But
                        such has been the rapidity with which trade has increased that even this
                        heavy expenditure has proved inadequate to keep pace with requirements of
                        commerce. During last antumn the port was blocked to such an extent that
                        timber ships were kept waiting for days and even weeks before they could
                        unload. This state of affairs was due partly to the increase of traffic
                        consequent on the cessation of the strike at Marseilles ; partly to the
                        apathy of the Alexandrian merchants, who provide neither sufficient lighters
                        to land their goods nor sufficient carts to carry them away, partly also no
                        doubt to insufficiency of quay room, to want of railway rolling stock and to
                        too lenient Port regulations. To remedy these inconveniences the Government
                        has decided, as soon as an agreement has been come to with the principal
                        timber merchants, to construct new quays at Gabbari at a cost of L.E.
                        180,000. (This sum does not appear in the printed Budget.) The Railway
                        Administration has been authorised) to proceed at once with the purchase of
                        additional rolling stock, and new Port regu. lations will shortly be
                        promulgatod. It is hoped that these measures, together with the co-operation
                        which the Government has a right to expect from the merchants, will do much
                        to relieve the congestion of traffic.</p>
                    <p>EGYPT AND THE SUDAN. A propos of L.E. 811,000 for the SuakinAtbara line and
                        of L.E. 150,000 for Sheikh Barghout chargeable to the new Reserve Fund, Mr.
                        Corbett gives the following opinions on the relations of the Sudan to Egypt
                        :</p>
                    <p>The wisdom, indeed the imperative necessity, of extensive capital expenditure
                        in the Sudan is not always clearly recognised. It sounds plausible enough to
                        say that Egyptian money would be better employed in Egypt than in a distant
                        province the very name of which is hateful to the dweller on the Lower Nile.
                        But such arguments can mislead none but the most ignorant. By whatever name
                        it may be called the land watered by the Nile, from the Abyssinian mountains
                        and the Great Lakes down to the shores of the Mediterranean, forms one
                        integral and indivisible whole. In these days of scientific engineering the
                        Power that rules the upper waters of the Nile controls the whole water
                        supply of Egypt. The possession of the Sudan is necessary, nay, more
                        necessary to Bgypt than the possession of Alexandria. This being so it would
                        be a shortsighted policy that would grudge the expenditure of capital to
                        secure the develop ment of a country with the future of which that of Egypt
                        is so indissolubly bound up.</p>
                    <p>Again, to put it on the lowest ground, money invested in the Sudan yields an
                        ex cellent return and the more rapidly the country is developed the suoner
                        the time will come when Egypt will be able first to reduce, and then to
                        suppress, the substantial anntal subvention which she now pays to meet the
                        Sudan deficit. Year by year the Sudan budget shows steadily inereasing
                        receipts, and with adequate encouragernent it may confidently be hoped that
                        before long the province will able to dispense with the pecuniary aid of the
                        Mother Country</p>

                    <head>FINANCIAL ADVISER'S NOTE.</head>
                    <p>The Vote of the Financial Adviser was pub lished on Saturday evening and far
                        exceeds in length Six Eldon Gorst's notes. But 1905 is the begining of the
                        era which is to end with the liberation of Egypt from her financial
                        trakunnels, and the public should be grateful to the liviser for having been
                        at such pains to cabinin the new features. The first chapter of the Vote
                        indicates in outline the changes which have been brought about in the
                        financial situation by the Anglo-French Convention of 1904, and the
                        promulgation, with the consent of the Powers, of the Khedivial Decree of
                        25th November. As we published in our issue of Saturday last an extract
                        dealing with this subject from Sir Eldon Gorst's contribution to the new
                        edition of Lord Milner's work on Egypt, there is no need for us to repeat
                        Mr. Corbet's review except to quote the followivg epitome of the financial
                        results of the</p>
                    <p>ANGLO-FRENCH AGREEMENT. </p>
                    <p>Independently of the fact that Egypt will henceforward have the disposal of
                        her own revenues with all the obvious advantages which this impries, the net
                        financial result of the new arrangement may be summed up as being the
                        addition of some L.E. 6,704,000 to the Reserve Fund in the hands of the
                        Government and a decrease of annual expeuditure equivalent to an increase of
                        revenue of about L.E. 265,000. Although the capital sum set free is
                        considerable and although the General Reserve of the Government is nothing
                        more than the accumulated surplus of the last few years, yet in view of the
                        fact that the Egyptian Government is still hampered by the terms of the
                        Imperial Firman of Investiture of April 14th, 1892, which probibits it from
                        contracting loaus, it has been decided to endeavour to maiutain that fuud at
                        as high a figure as possible. It will be drawn on with great caution and,
                        except when urgent necessity compels a departure from the rule, only for
                        such remunerative purposes as would under normal conditions justify the
                        employment of borrowed capital. It will be credited with such budget
                        surpluses as may be realized from time to time as well as with the interest
                        on its own invested balances. The Decree of 28th November therefore only
                        directly affects the budget for 1905 in so far as it permits (independently
                        of the probable increase of revenue) an addition to the expenditure during
                        the year of some L.E. 265,000.</p>
                    <p>The Note being too long to admit of reproduction in extenso we will extract
                        the passages of the greatest interest :</p>
                    <p>1903-1904. The Nile flood of 1903 was late, but of average volume ; and the
                        financial results of 1904 promise to exceed by more than L.E. 1,000,000
                        those of 1903, which was itself a record year. The figures of revenue are :
                        1903</p>
                    <p>. L.E. 12,463,700 1904 (estimated)... » 13,485,000 There was an increase
                        under practically every head, the man sources of revenue being those which
                        gave the most striking results. The receipts from the Land Tax increased by
                        LE. 100,000; from the Customs by L.E. - 150,000 ; from Tobacco by L.E.
                        100,000 , from the Railways by L.E. 280,000.</p>
                    <p>The Revenue of 1903 exceeded the estimates by nearly L.E. 1,500,000 : the
                        Revenue for 1904 will in all probability exceed the estimates by nearly L.E.
                        2,000,000.</p>
                    <p>1905. The country has advanced in prosperity by leaps and bounds, but it is
                        wise to remember that the almost sensational results of the last few years
                        are due in part at least to adventitious causes on the permanent continuance
                        of which it would be imprudent to count. Stable government, security of life
                        and property, impartial administration of the law,fiscal reform and the
                        introduction of foreign capital have all had their share in promoting the
                        economic development of Egypt, but in the face of a permanent remission of
                        taxation during the last 20 years, estimated at more than L.E. 1,600,000 a
                        year, these causes would hardly in themselves have been sufficient to raise
                        the revenue from L.E.10,431,000 in 1895 to something like L.E.13,500,000 in
                        1905 had it not been for the enormous returns resulting from the cultivation
                        of cotton.</p>
                    <p>COTTON. </p>
                    <p>Commenting on the amount and value of the cotton crop according to the export
                        figures of the Customs Returns during the last 10 years Mr. Corbet remarks
                        :--</p>
                    <p>There are not wanting signs that the profits from this source cannot be
                        relied on to increase indefinitely in the same proportion. The following
                        table shows the area under cotton with the quantity of the crop according to
                        the statistics of the amount received at Alexandria from the interior since
                        1902:-- 180123: Festas oder Cotton. 1,275,676 Quantity of Crap. 6,369,911

                    <p>1,135,708</p>
                    <p>6,568,947 The figures relating to the area under cotton are those of the
                        Direct Taxes' Department of the Ministry of Finance, based on the
                        declarations of the cultivators. They are almost certainly an underestimate,
                        but for purposes of comparison may be taken as approximately correct.</p>
                    <p>It is too soon to express an opinion as to whether the diminution in the
                        ratio of production to the area cultivated is owing to fortuitous conditions
                        or to circumstances which due foresight and the application of seientific
                        methods may be able to control, and there is every reason to believe the
                        cultivation of cotton will for many years to come continue to form a most
                        profitable source of income to the people of Egypt, but at the same time, in
                        obedience to the elementary economic law of demand and supply, large profits
                        induce com <cb n="2"/>petition, and it is probable that Egypti cotton will
                        in the not distant future have contend with an increased production from
                        foreign countries and a consequent fall i price.</p>
                    <p>ESTIMATES FOR 1905. </p>
                    <p>After noting the bad Nile and the catt! plague the Adviser continues :</p>
                    <p>"king all these cireumstances into accou the Government has not felt
                        justified in launching into expenditura on an extravagan scale. The old
                        tradition of cautions revenu estimates is maintained ; those of expenditur
                        though apparently largely in excess of pas years are in fact swelled by the
                        inclusion to the first time of a variety of items uot pre viously brought
                        into account. The real in crease is L.E. 604,878, as will be explainer
                        below. The aim of the Government in the present budget has been to place
                        clearly before the public the gross receipts, the gros expenditure, and the
                        net surplus. With thi object a sum of L.E. 275,109 has now for the first
                        time been brought into account. Som few anomalies, the legacy of the abnorma
                        conditions of past years, still remain, but they are insignificant in amount
                        and will be correct ed in future budgets.</p>

                    <p>POLICE EFFICIENCY. </p>
                    <p>The budget of the Ministry of the Interior is fixed at L.E. 568,464 as
                        against L.E. 489,694 in 1904, or a total ditierence of L.E. 78,770. The
                        increase in the Central Administration is nominally L.E. 18,092, of which
                        L.E. 2,360 were, however, formerly deducted from receipts, leaving a real
                        increase of L.E. 15,732 due almost entirely to raising the strength and im
                        proving the pay of the non-commissioned ofti. cers and men ol the police. It
                        has long been felt that in order to obtain reliable recruits for the force
                        it would be necessary, in view of the rise in the rate of wages, to offer
                        better pecuniary inducement. The low rates of pay hitherto granted to the
                        rank and file, P.T. 150 a month in Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said, and P.T.
                        100 throughout the provinces, has made it impossible to attract desirable
                        volunteers. Consequently, except in Cairo and Alexandria, where a certain
                        number of exsoldiers offer themselves for enlistment, the force has to be
                        recruited from men who, having completed their five years' Army service, are
                        passed into the Reserve, where they are liable to another period of five
                        years in the police if required.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned above a sum of L.E. 20 obtains complete exemption from military
                        service, and the prosperity in the country is now such that none but the
                        most indigent class of the population allow their sons to serve. These men,
                        though they profit somewhat by their army training, afford but poor material
                        for policemen. As funds have become available, an effort has been made to
                        improve the position of the N.C.O.s and a proportion of the men. Only those
                        who are really fit to be policemen are now promoted to N.C.O. rank, and the
                        pick of the rank and file, are rated as 1st class police with a pay of L.E.
                        2 instead of P.T. 150 per month in the cities, and P.T. 175 instead of P.T.
                        100 in the provinces. It is hoped that eventually these raies may be
                        somewhat increased. The Police School, where 40 cadet officers and 160 cadet
                        N.C.O.'s are at present being trained, will in the future, when the
                        necessary funds for accommodation and staff are forthcoming, provide a six
                        months training for every volunteer selected. Training and instruction as
                        well as increased pay are essential to any real improvement in the force; it
                        would obviously be useless forth with to double the pay of a class of men
                        whose services are sometimes dearly purchased at the present rates.</p>
                    <p>A MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE. </p>
                    <p>In mentioning the increase of L.E. 3,400 to the grant to the Agricultural
                        Society, the Adviser states :</p>
                    <p>Statistics of a kind have hitherto been col. lected by the different
                        departments, but the work has not been done on any regular system, with the
                        result that much of its utility was lost. With the rapid development of the
                        country the creation of a central bureau able to organise the compilation of
                        statistics, and especially agricultural statistics, on a uniform and
                        scientific basis, has become an urgent necessity. The Agricultural Society
                        with the limited means at its disposal has rendered good service in past
                        years in connection with: the purchase and distribution of seed and manures.
                        On the initiative of the Government it has lately been reorganised and an
                        executive committee nominated consisting of twelve members especially chosen
                        as possessing the necessary qualifications for making the so <cb n="3"/>

                        be eminently a question which should recupy the attention of the enltivators
                        themselves, and it is with a view to fostering and encouraging the spirit of
                        self-help that the Agricultural Society has been started on its present
                        basis. When necessary the Government will be ready to assist in any way that
                        may be in its power, but such assistance will doubtless often be expected to
                        take a pecuniary forn and no increased grant will be given unless the
                        society can show that it is discharging its daties with efficiency,</p>
                    <p>PROVINCIAL GHAFFIRS. </p>
                    <p>The increase under the head of provincial administration and revenue service
                        is L.E. 83,896, of which L.E. 19,812 were formerly charged to receipts,
                        leaving a real increase of L.E. 64,084, of which L.E. 2,748 are for
                        improving the scale of pay of Bashkatebs, Mamour markaz, etc., and L.E.
                        8,280 for the pay of clerks to the Markaz 'Tribunals. But far the most
                        important addition is represented by a sum of L.E. 50,000, being the
                        contribution of the Government to the pay of provincial ghafiirs. Precisely
                        as in the case of the Army and of the Police it has been found that the pay
                        ot P.T. 60 per month hitherto allowed to the ghaffirs was insufficient to
                        attract any but the lowest and most disreputable class of the community. In
                        the interests of public security it was necessary to make some improvement,
                        and the pay has now been raised to an average of P.T. 100 per month. The
                        cost estimated at some L.E. 100,000 has been met by the above Government
                        grant ot L.E. 50,000 and the increase of the local ghaffir tax for an
                        equivalent amount. The importance of an efficient ghafhir stafl, especially
                        in times of epidemic, can hardly be exaggerated and it is hoped that the
                        results will justify the very considerable outlay involved.</p>
                    <p>A PLAIN 'HINT.</p>
                    <p>The contraband trade of bashish,chiefly from Greece and through the
                        intermediary of Greek traders, has long been nothing short of a publie
                        scandal. It is confidently hoped that the Government of Athens will take the
                        necessary steps to check an abuse which reflects most unfavourably on the
                        fair fame of the Greeks in Egypt, especially of the numerous and respected
                        Hellenic cuminunity of Alexandria, the leaders of which are no less
                        interested than the Egyptiun authorities in putting an end to the present
                        deplorable state of things.</p>
                    <p>' ARMY OF OCCUPATION. </p>
                    <p>In the early days of the Occupation, the yearly contribution of the Egyptian
                        Treasury towards the expenses of the British garrison was a sum representing
                        at the time the true extra cost of maintaining the then existing garrison,
                        over and above that which would have been incurred had 'the troops been
                        stationed in the United Kingdom. In 1885 an arrangement was made under which
                        Egypt paid a sum of £4 per bead per month towards the expenses of the troops
                        up to a maximum of £200,000. This arrangement remained in force for two
                        years, after which the sum was reduced to L.E. 84,825. At this figure,
                        independently of extraordinary expenditure connected with military
                        operations in the Sudan, it has been allowed to remain ever since, although
                        it has been far from represent. ing the true extra cost of the garrison,</p>
                    <p>In the course of last summer the matter was reconsidered and the British
                        Government, taking into consideration the improved financial condition of
                        Egypt, expressed a desire to return to the original agreement. It was
                        impossible to contest so legitimate a demand, but, in order that the future
                        charge should not weigh heavily on the Egyptian Treasury, it was agreed that
                        the number of British troops permanently stationed in the country should be
                        reduced and the sum payable fixedat L.E.97,000 (£100,000) &amp; year, or an
                        increase of only L.E. 12,675. This sum, which will not be liable to
                        Huctuations arising from any minor changes in the total cost of garrison,
                        represents approximately the true extra expenditure incurred by the British
                        Government by reason of the presence of a British force, as it will be
                        constituted from 1st January 1905 onwards, in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>HOW DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS CURED HIM OF ADVANCED KIDNEY</p>
                    <p>DISEASE.</p>
                    <p>Kidney Disease, when it reaches the point of causing sudden collapse, as in
                        the case of Mr. Mark Young, landlord of the Victoria Hotel, Victoria-Street,
                        Southwick, Sunderland, is nothing more or less than poisoning of the blood.
                        The overworked kidneys fail to clear the blood, and the blood becomes
                        impure.</p>
                    <p>There is only one cure, and that is to clear out the poison by giving new
                        blood to the veins. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People bave precisely
                        this power. That is the secret of their cures. Whatever diseases arise from
                        too little blood, a blood that lacks richness and purity, they can cure,
                        just as surely as food cures hunger. Blood is the food of the body: Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills are the food of the blood. The genuine pills always
                        bear Dr. Williams' name, and substitutes are useless and fraudulent. Dr.
                        Williams' Medicine Company, Holborn Viaduct, London, will send a box
                        post-free for 28. 9d. (or six boxes for 13s. 9d.): but they can be had at
                        all medicine shops provided purchasers insist (it is often necessary to
                        insist) on having the genuine and on refusing any substitute. It is by
                        making new blood that they cure anemia, bile, consumption, decline,
                        indigestion, St. Vitus' dance: it is by making pure blood that they cure
                        rheumatism, kidney disease, eczema, and all skin troubles. They improve the
                        appetite almost from the first dose, and they give strength to everyone.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Young's case is a good example. "I used to suffer from disease of the
                        kidneys," he stated, "and I was afraid I should never get well again. Cold
                        shivering fits were one of the symptoms. These used to come on 80 suddenly
                        and unexpectedly that I was often attacked when out visiting or walking,
                        when I would have to be taken home in a cab, and put to bed in hot blankets
                        to keep me warm. I suffered terribly at times in a way which all those who
                        have buffered from their kidneys will understand. I was nearly doubled up
                        with the pain. I slept badly every night, and had to exercise the greatest
                        care in my choice of food. My illness was not aggravated by beer or spirits,
                        as you might think, for, although a publican, I am &amp; strict teetotaller.
                        I had been under the care of a doctor for a long time, when I happened to
                        read in a newspaper of a cure by Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People,
                        and I immediately decided to try whether they would have any effect on me.
                        They have undoubtedly cured me.</p>
                    <p>"Before I had been taking them for a month I felt a great deal better. My
                        appetite had improved, the pains had disappeared, and in other respects I
                        was quite a changed man. I persevered with the pills, and in a very short
                        time I was quite well again. The effect the pills had on me was really
                        marvellous. My friends were greatly astonished at my recovery. I am so
                        strong now that I can walk twenty miles without feeling the least tired. Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills are really a wonderful medicine, and I can honestly
                        recommend them to all sufferers."</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
