                        <p>Throughout yesterday the wind blew steadily light from the North, with
                            every appearnce of change. From 3 a.m. to 3.45 a.m. it freshened
                            suddenly in a squall of wind and a shower to a moderate gale from the
                            East, the rain register being 0.01. After a lapse of about ¾ of an hour
                            the wind backed to North again and the gale abated to a light breeze,
                            with slight sea and showery. Heavy peals of thunder and vivid lightning
                            prevailed throughout the night. Rain fell heavily about 1 a.m. to-day
                            Barometer falling.</p>

                    <head>THE VALUE OF EGYPTIAN PUBLIC OPINION.</head>
                    <p>Public opinion does not exist in Egypt in the broad sense of the term as
                        understood in Europe or the United States. The only kind of public opinion
                        known here is of a sectional character, which the Government is often
                        justified in neglecting. Sometimes, however, this collective exercise of
                        opinion by a section of the community has to be hearkened to, and the recent
                        withdrawal of the crude and im-mature Pharmacy Regulations in obedience to
                        the opinions of the pharmacists of Cairo and Alexandria is a case in point.
                        But this agità-tion of a comparatively compact body. of
                        technically-qualified individuals should awaken the Government to a
                        recognition of the fact that legislation is a matter of publie importance,
                        and is nota mere question of turning out by the yard a series of enactments,
                        which' might pass muster among mere draftsmen, without having regard to the
                        various in-terests at stake, For example, where legisla-tion has relation to
                        commerce, there whole classes of the community may find themselves
                        injuriously affected. The system now in vogue is to elaborate laws and
                        regulations, affecting all denominations of the population, without allowing
                        the public to discuss these matters until they are made law. Some officials
                        in an administration draw up the provisions and they are, as a matter of
                        course, submitted to the Council of Ministers for the perfunctory assent of
                        that body. It is only when the Journal Officiel appears, which is about as
                        inuch read as is our own London Gazette, that we know that a law has been
                        passed or a regulation made whereby perhaps a whole industry is crippled,
                        andin some cases, it might be, irreparably injured. Agitation, up to the
                        present, has been extremely rare, but in the future the authorities, if they
                        are not more circumspect, will have to reckon with it as a force which may
                        undermine their prestige. The Pharmacy Regulations are a case in point and
                        will form a well-established precedent. If the. Government had published the
                        draft of the Pharmacy Regulations before sending them to the Mixed Appeal
                        Court, they might have escaped a very humiliating position, which reflects
                        seriously, not alone on the Sanitary Administration more especially, but on
                        this vicious system as a whole.</p>

                            Delcasse yesterday evening spoke eloquenntly and exhaustively in favour
                            of the agreement, which he said was a new and powerful guarantee for
                            peace. The Convention was rendered possible by Frnace giving up what
                            England particularly coveted, and by England abandoning what was
                            particularly precious to France.</p>

                    <p>The hearing of this case was resumed at 10 o'clock yesterday morning.</p>
                    <p>Aly Sadik Hassan Ramadan, a donkey-boy of Assouan, was called.</p>
                    <p>Examined by Mr. Briscoe :- He was in front of the hotel about the time of the
                        departure of the express. The defendant came out and mounted the donkey. The
                        Sudanese laid hold of the bridle and asked for money. When Mr: Sleeman
                        mounted the donkey, witness was about four yards off. When the Sudanese
                        asked for money, Mr. Sleeman drew his revolver and shot him. Witness did not
                        see any stick in the hands of the Sudanese, but he saw the man seize hold of
                        the bridle as soon as Mr. Sleeman mounted. When the first shot was fired,
                        witness saw the Sudanese lay hold of Mr. Sleeman by the waist. and pull him
                        off. The witness then ran away. Before the shooting began he noticed only
                        the one man, who was holding the bridle of the donkey. He failed to notice
                        whether any police were about before the shooting.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- He saw absolutely no one else except the Sudanese who laid
                        hold of the bridle. He did not notice the revolver before Mr. Sleeman drew
                        it from his belt. When witness was examined at the Markaz he made no
                        statement to the effect that Mr. Sleeman brandished his revolver before
                        shooting and cried "let go" in Arabic. Defendant drew his revolver and shot
                        the Sudanese without firing first on the ground.</p>
                    <p>Madani Shaluk, a donkey-boy at Assouan, was the next witness.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Briscoe : - When the defendant had mounted the donkey, he turned and
                        saw the Sudanese holding the bridle .. "He did not notice the others. When
                        the Sudanese laid hold of the bridle, defendant twice told the Sudanese to
                        leave go. The defendant was riding witness's donkey. Mr. Halliday was riding
                        Aly Sadik's donkey and it was he who cried out twice to the Sudanese to
                        leave go. Witness was behind the donkey, while the Sudanese was on the left.
                        He did not notice that the Sudanese was carrying anything in his hand. After
                        the first shot he ran away, so could not remember how many shots were
                        fired.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- Besides the man who was shot, no one else laid hold of the
                        bridle. Mr. Sleeman never said "let go." It was. his companion who said so.
                        Mr. Sleeman did not point or flourish his revolver before shooting. He
                        simply drew the revolver and fired. There were many people about at the time
                        and witness did not notice the other Sudanese. The local Court was sitting
                        on that day, so the street was crowded with people. Whether they were
                        carrying sticks or not, he did not notice particularly, as the throng of
                        people was great.</p>
                    <p>Mohamed Aly Awad, policeman, No. 15587; of Assouan, was next called.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Briscoe :- At about 8.30 a.m. on the day in question, he was on duty
                        near the Court, which is about sixty metres from the hotel. He heard the
                        report of shots in front of the hotel and he went thither. He saw the
                        defendant on the ground and the was held by and also was holding the
                        Sudanese. He only noticed one Sudanese. There were several persons about at
                        that time, about ten metres off. He heard three or four shots fired quickly
                        one after the other. It only took witness from a minute to a minute and
                        a-half to come to the spot. Witness was the first policeman to get there.
                        The next policeman to arrive was Hammam. Khalifa. The wounded Sudanese had
                        nothing in his hand, nor did he notice any sticks lying about on the
                        ground.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- The hotel is on the north side of the station. He had not
                        passed the hotel before the shooting. He could give no opinion as to the
                        state of the street in front of the hotel prior to the shooting. When Mr.
                        Sleeman was arrested and taken to the Markaz witness did not know what
                        occurred subsequently. He arrested him and handed him over to two other
                        policemen.</p>
                    <p>By the Judge :- There are no policemen en point duty about, but they pass up
                        and down. When he arrived there was no police patrol there. The patrol came
                        up afterwards. He did not know the Sudanese before. There are many Sudanese
                        workmen in Assouan. They are often lawless in their conduct. They get drunk
                        and make disturbances. They fight between themselves, but do not make much
                        use of sticks. Witness was not on duty o the previous dày.</p>
                    <p>Hammam Khalifa, policeman, of Assouan was next called.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Gottlieb: When witness arrived after the shooting. Mr. Sleeman was
                        being held by Gomar and shouting for help. At the moment witness did not
                        notice whether Mr Sleeman was or was not excited. Witness her denied certain
                        statements made by him a Cairo in his examination-in-chief. He did no
                        remember seeing the Italian barber, Michae Conte, at the time. There was a
                        large crow of people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Briscoe said he would not call Michae Conte, as he could only treat him
                        as a hostile witness. </p>
                    <p>Counsel for the defence then called on Counsel for the Crown to call Mr.
                        Halliday and Michael Conte.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. H. Halliday, mining prospector, employed by the North Nile Valley Co.,
                        was next called.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Briscoe :- On the Wednesday, the day before the shooting, witness
                        noticed a number of Sudanese in the town. He was a spectator when the
                        Acting-Moudir gave a decision as to the wages of the contract-boys. He saw
                        accused with the interpreter and the four Sudanese go to the hotel. Witness
                        did not join them, as he went to the bar, so did not notice what passed.
                        Witness saw Gomar <cb n="4"/>on that particular day with a tomahawk. But he
                        would not say that he was armed with any weapon or stick at the particular
                        time in question. A number of Sudanese were wandering about the town, but
                        they were not all employes of the company. This crowd was unusual. Witness
                        thought they had come there to see that their friends got their money. He
                        was under the impression that some police were passing by the hotel. </p>
                    <p>Witness was not staying at the hotel. On Thursday, the day of the shooting,
                        he went to the station at about 8.30 a.m. and met Mr. Sleeman there. Mr.
                        Sleeman asked witness to come back to the hotel with him as he thought there
                        might be a little trouble. Witness intended to leave by that morning's
                        express. Mr. Sleeman gave witness a stick to carry. Both witness and Mr.
                        Sleeman mounted donkeys. When at the door of the hotel, he heard Mr. Sleeman
                        cry out "Let go the donkey." Gomar Said had hold of the left rein of the
                        donkey. There were four Sudanese close together. There was a crowd of about
                        25 men on the other side of the street. The street was exceptionally quiet
                        that morning. Witness also told them to let go Mr. Sleeman's donkey. When
                        witness turned round, he saw accused draw his revolver and was sure that he
                        heard Mr. Sleeman again tell the men to say let go. Mr. Sleeman fired one
                        shot on the ground. Gomar had a stick. He had been brandishing it about
                        previously and witness took it that he tried to hit Mr. Sleeman. Witness
                        presumed then that either Mr. Sleeman or Gomar would have to go down, as the
                        time was ripe for action. There was a man pulling at Mr. Sleeman from
                        behind. The third shot was fired behind at this man. Mr. Sleeman was twisted
                        at the time on the saddle, as the Sudanese were pulling him in front and
                        behind. Mr. Sleeman rolled on to the ground. Two more men tried to close in,
                        when witness stepped in and prevented them. Rislan and Gohar made lounges at
                        witness with sticks. While this was going on, Mr. Sleeman and two Sudanese
                        were rolling on the ground. In about three minutes the police came and
                        arrested Mr. Sleeman. The Sub-Moudir and a lot of police afterwards came. </p>
                    <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- On the previous day crowds of Sudanese were about and many
                        in front of the hotel. They carried sticks as usual. The sticks were about
                        1½-inch in diameter with leather on the end. On both days he saw the axe. On
                        the first day Gomar was carrying it. On the second day he saw the axe
                        carried by some one in the scrimmage during the shooting, but could not say
                        who was carrying it. Immediately before the shooting he saw Gomar holding
                        the donkey's bridle. Rislan and Gohar had sticks. About 25 Sudanese and
                        Arabs were about, but they took no part in the scrimmage, but witness could
                        see that those men "were in the know." In witness's own opinion Mr. Sleeman
                        was in serious danger. Witness has worked with natives all his life and he
                        knows them. If Mr. Sleeman had not fired, he would have had his head split
                        open. After the arrest of Mr. Sleeman, witness followed with the Sub-Moudir
                        and appealed to that official not to let him be bound. Witness had not had a
                        long experience of Sudanese. The Sudanese in question were not tractable in
                        camp, in the same way as the Arabs are: </p>
                    <p>By the Judge :- Before the revolver was pulled out, witness considered that
                        "things were getting very mixed indeed." </p>
                    <p>This statement closed the case for the prosecution. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Sleeman then gave evidence on his own behalf. </p>
                    <p>The witness Michael Conte, an Italian barber of Assouan, was called for the
                        defence. The defence also called Mr. Sleeman's interpreter. The evidence of
                        these two witnesses was of little material importance. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Nolan, medico-legal expert of the Parquet of the Ministry of Justice, was
                        next called and gave some interesting and very technical evidence on the
                        subject of the death-dealing powers of nabouts. </p>
                    <p>Counsel for the accused then addressed the jury, his main point being that
                        Mr. Sleeman was justified in his action under the pressure of self-defence.
                        Counsel for the Crown replied, his chief contention being that the
                        circumstances of this case precluded the argument of self-defence from
                        prevailing. </p>
                    <p>The Judge summed up minutely and the jury then retired. After having been
                        absent for the space of one hour, they returned to Court, having been unable
                        to agree as to their verdict. The Judge then read further evidence and the
                        jury, without again retiring to deliberate, returned a verdiet of "Not
                        Guilty." The accused was then discharged.</p>

                    <p>The Hellenic community of Alexandria gave a magnificent fete yesterday
                        afternoon in honour of the Commodore and officers of the Greek Squadron, at
                        the New Khedivial Hotel. The gardens of the hotel lend themselves ad-
                        mirably for such a function, and the whole of the ground floor of the hotel
                        was also utilised. The Hellenic community had invited all the leading
                        members of every European colony in Alexandria, and there was a very large
                        and representative gathering present. The fete began at 4 p.m., the guests
                        being received by Mr. Benachi, the president of the Hellenic community, and
                        his wife. Dancing commenced at about 5 o'clock and was carried on in an
                        elaborately arranged open-air ball- room, which had been erected in the
                        gardens. The weather left nothing to be desired, and the climate during the
                        afternoon was delightfully cool and temperate, which made dancing most
                        agreeable. The fete was in every respect a success and was greatly enjoyed
                        by all present. The following is the list of guests invited to the dinner,
                        to be given by the Governor of Alexandria at the Khedivial Club to-night in.
                        honour of the Commodore and officers of the Squadron : M. Gennadis, Greek
                        Diplomatic Agent and Consul-General, M. Scotidis, Greek Consul-General

                        performance of Il Trovatore at the Abbas Helmy Theatre. Commodore
                        Coundouriotis and a number of officers go up to Cairo to-morrow. The
                        officers will attend a service on Monday morning at St. Nicholas' Church,
                        Cairo. Eight hundred of the sailors from the three ships landed this morning
                        and proceeded to the Antoniades Gardens, where they are being entertained by
                        the Hellenic community to a picnic. As we go to press we learn that the
                        picnic has been postponed owing to one of the sailors having been
                        accidentally drowned this morning in the Mahmoudieh Canal, in the neighbour-
                        hood of the gardens.</p>

                    <head>THE PHARMACY AGITATION.<lb/>RECONSTITUTION OF CAIRO ASSOCIATION.</head>
                    <p>The pharmacists of Cairo met on Thursday night to reconstitute their
                        association, which had lapsed owing to the fact that none of the members had
                        paid the necessary fees for four years. Only members of the old association
                        who held diplomas were permitted to draw up a constitution for the new body,
                        though the task was not peculiarly difficult as the old statutes were
                        adopted en bloc .. After brief preliminaries the officers of the association
                        .were elected. Dr. Küppers was appbinted president by general consent, and
                        the vice-presidency and the posts of secretary general and treasurer fell by
                        large majorities to. Mr. N. Joannovich, Mr. Georgiades, and Mr. Montini,
                        respectively. The remaining members of the committee were then elected,
                        Messrs. A. Mandofia, Gamages, Moharrem Bey, and Hebert being chosen by show
                        of hands. Professor Dinkler was unanimously requested to act as honorary
                        president of the association. In discussing the new regulations, Professor
                        Dinkler criticised the action of the Commission appointed to study them with
                        a view to sug- gesting certain modifications. What the com- mittee preposed
                        was tantamount to a new "projet de loi"; would the Sanitary Depart- ment be
                        likely to accept it ? An animated discussion re the points at issue
                        followed.</p>

                    <p>The following is an extract from the speech of M. Deschanel in the Chamber of
                        Deputies on the 3rd inst .- "En Egypte, nous reconnaissons en fait le
                        protectorat de l'Angleterre et nous abandonnons completement les finances
                        egyptiennes a l'An- gleterre. En permettant le remboursement de la Dette
                        Unifiée, en 1912, au lieu de 1941, nous permettons à l'Angleterre de
                        réaliser un bénéfice considerable aux depens des porteurs français qui
                        détiennent les deux tiers des actions. Dans huit ans, l'Angleterre aura
                        entre les mains tontes les finances égyptiennes. En cedant ses droits à
                        l'Angleterre la France va permettre à l'Angleterre de faire tout ce qu'elle
                        voudra dans toute la region du Nil. Nous allons ainsi favoriser le rêve de
                        l'Angleterre de faire payer par l'Egypte les frais d'occupation du Soudan et
                        de pénétration du Congo et d'être la souveraine maitresse du Cap au Caire.
                        Quelle lourde série de fautes. commises depuis vingt ans, depuis

                            Khartoum, sends us the following communication :- "I have had my
                            attention called to an article which appeared in your issue of October
                            25 and dealt with the destruction of mosquitoes in Khartoum. I do not
                            know whence you derived your information as the laboratories' report has
                            not yet appeared, but I regret that such an article should have been
                            published. It is not exactly erroneous, but it is misleading, and
                            half-truths are always dangerous. In reading it one would think there
                            had only been one variety of mosquito in Khartoum and that one a
                            malaria-carrier. As will be at once apparent from the report when it
                            appears, and a copy of which I have direoted to be sent to you, there
                            were three main genera of mosquitoes in Khar- toum, all of them capable
                            of transmitting disease, but only one of these was an anopheline capable
                            of transmitting the malarial parasite from man to man. Moreover, this
                            mosquito was not the most common of the three and ita breeding places
                            were limited. It is perfectly true that it has disappeared from Khartoum
                            since anti-malarial operations were begun, aa has the "tiger" mosquito,
                            which in the New World transmits the parasite of yellow fever. The'
                            common brown gnat of the tropics, however, still persists, though in
                            greatly reduced numbers. Instead of 50 per cent. of the water
                            collections, wells, pools, garden tanks, etc., being infected, there are
                            now only about 3 per cent., and it will not be easy to reduce this
                            figure. I notice you state that steamers are stopped and cleared some
                            distanoe from the town. It is true this plan was adopted but it had to
                            be abandoned. for several reasons. At present the steamers are treated
                            before leaving and during their voyages, and apart from them there is
                            little chance of Khartoum being infected from without, as was the case
                            at Mian-Mir in India, where the operations resulted in failure."</p>

                    <head>A MYSTERY OF THE NILE</head>
                    <p>In Dr. Sven Hedin's reminiscences of General Kuropatkin, which appeared in
                        the Times last week, the writer remarks as follows .- "Once when I was
                        dining with General Kuropatkin he had as a guest a colonel who had recently
                        returned from Fashoda. After dinner the. latter was to present to the
                        Minister of War two Cossacks, who had exhibited unusual proof of courage and
                        presence of mind by swimming across the Nile on some important errand.
                        Kuropatkin invited me to accompany him to witness the ceremony which was
                        then abouit to take place .. The Cossacks were waiting in the vestibule,
                        each wearing the gold medal which he had that day received from the Tsar.
                        The general at once addressed the two men in a short speech, thanking them
                        for the example they had set to their comrades in the army, and then gave to
                        each man as a memento a gold watch in a case and a roll of gold roubles." It
                        would be interesting to know what these Cossacks were doing on the Nile and
                        why their services were so highly valued by the Tsar.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>
                    <p>Sir,-In your issue of Angust 25th, 1904, you refer editorially to the
                        conclusive reply of the Vice Governor-General of the Congo Free State to
                        Lord Cromer's letter to Lord Lansdowne, dated January 21st, 1903. You say:
                        "We have protested at different time- against the efforts to concentrate
                        public atten- tion on what is comimonly called the Congo Atrocities,'" and
                        add that while you have no doubt that the allegations in this respect are
                        true, you fear that by insisting too much on the symptoms Congophobes "run
                        the risk of adverting the attention from the causes of the illness" which
                        you attribute to the Govern- ment of the Congo State. Continuing, yon
                        declare that "the worst evils which the Congo natives are suffering are the
                        direct and un- avoidable result of the methods adopted by the State's
                        Administration" .. Inasmuch as you complacently urge an alteration in the
                        tactics at play in England against the Congo, I ask you to- kindly give
                        space for reply to your accusation of the "State's methods and
                        administration," from one who, having for a long time closely studied both
                        sides of the Congo question, is untram melled by material relationship to
                        either party Briefly replying to the unsupported state ments in the letter
                        of Lord Cromer, who cruised eighty miles along and far out of sight of the
                        Belgian bank of the Nile, permit me to quote from the published statements
                        of Major Sir James J. Harrison, made on his return last June from an
                        expedition into the interior of the Congo Free State, in which he travelled
                        8,000 miles and employed 1,200 native porters. Major Harrison says :-
                        "Again, Lord Cromer contrasts the peaceful, settled state and the confidence
                        of the tribes under English rule on the Nile as compared with those on
                        Belgian territory ; yet within a few months of his visit a whole British
                        force was annihilated on the Bahr el Ghazal, while in the Game Ordinance
                        published last year it stated: The whole of the left bank of the Nile is at
                        present closed to sportsmen, owing to the unsettled state of the natives.
                        "Since my return I see yet another British force has been severely handled
                        by the natives. Through the whole of my Congo trip absolutely alone, I
                        wandered about, visiting fifty different tribes and hundreds of villages,
                        armed as a rule with a camera, umbrella, and, at times, a collection gun.
                        Yet I had no unpleasant ex- periences, on the contrary, I was received with
                        kindness far different to any I ever met with when hunting among British
                        African natives." "Another statement that the soldiers are allowed:full
                        liberty to plunder the natives' is by no means . correct. During my journey
                        I saw hundreds of soldiers being sent off on different work-such as postal,
                        government despatches, fetching in porters, etc., but not one ever left
                        without having received cloth, beads or wire suffieient to purchase all
                        necessary food. I quite admit a few of the soldiers helped themselves now
                        and again, and I found the worst sinners in this respect were our own Sierra
                        Leone boys, a number of whom take service in the Congo.</p>
                    <p>"Many an hour at night I used to spend getting them to talk about the
                        country, its ways, and any grievances. I found, naturally, two or three
                        officers who were evidently disliked, but on the other hand, they talked of
                        many officers as their 'white fathers.' As for the way in which the Belgians
                        have opened out the country it is wonderful. Though I was told in Khartoum
                        by several of our officers, who had been stationed on the frontier how well
                        the Lado Enclave has run, I was quite astonished at such progress. /1 am
                        glad to see my views are shared by Major Gibbons and Captain Bell, both of
                        whom have had the chance of seeing life inland from the Nile.". Fortifying,
                        and in many instanees going far beyond the statements of this disinterested
                        traveller, are the statements of a large number of other Englishmen and
                        women, missionaries, traders and merchants, among whom are Sir Henry M.
                        Stanley, Mr. Grenfell, Mr. W. For- feit, Capt. M. D. Bell, of the British
                        Army, Mr. Michsel Holland, Mr. E. Van Hees, Mr. Gresh- off, Messrs, Ascenso
                        and Polidari, Italian phy- sicians, Mr. French-Sheldon, and Dr. Christy. An
                        English missionary, writing in the Manchester Guardian, says :-- . "I have
                        never seen or heard of any of the atrocities with which the agenta of the
                        Free State are charged on the contrary, one cannot bat admire the wonderful
                        progresa that has been made in so short a time; the commend- able way in
                        which the natives are treated; the little work that is exacted of them, and
                        the manner in which they are panetually paid for every service rendered or
                        work done. The little work which is occasionally exacted of them by way of
                        tax in porterage or otherwise is as nothing when compared to the immense
                        benefits conferred upon them by the State. In fact the methods of the
                        Belgian officers drew a highly complimentary euiogium from the Sir-dar
                        during his recent visit to the Enclave of Lado, methods which, he, stated,
                        might be fol- lowed with advantage by our English officers: Messieurs, nous
                        avons d'excellentes leçons de- vant vos yeux.'" Dr. Christy compares the
                        superiority of the Congo rule with the indolence of British rale in Central
                        Africa; and attributes the moral and material progress in the former "to the
                        fact that the Belgians have made the natives work. The Belgians have gone on
                        the principle that the native must be a participating element in the

                        par- ticipate by labour, taxation, and moral and intellectusl contribution
                        to the support and welfare of his State. Ignorance of the motives impelling
                        Congo State administration have misled those who have brought prejudice to a
                        subject worth the <cb n="2"/> attention only of the broadest minds. I find
                        the Congo system to be in entire conformity with the general act of Berlin,
                        wherein freedom of trade is assured to'the subjects of all coun- tries.
                        Briefly stated, the system is to devote the revenue from the state
                        properties to the moral and material organisation of the country. To resort
                        to the imposition of a tax in special cases as rarely as possible. To exact
                        a few hours monthly from the native in order to give the habit of work which
                        is the greatest of civilizing precepts. The Congo Government goes beyond
                        duty and pays the native for this work, teaching them the relation between
                        labour and its reward. This habit, when formed, elevates the native from the
                        savage instinets which tend to debase him in idleness and barbarity. Those
                        who argue that the enforced practice of habits of industry upon savages is
                        an unjust and iniquitous burden can have no sense of life and its burdens in
                        the centres of the world's highest civilization. The Congo State, like all
                        other States, acquired possession of ownerless lands. All lands which the
                        natives occupy with at least the rudiments of industry and peace, are
                        guaranteed to them. What for ages had been mused and udeveloped for the good
                        of mankind, native or foreign, is being successfally exploited by the Congo
                        State. Before, the vast Congo forests were not even traversed by the
                        indolent native so long as he could acquire his food in the sluggard
                        idleuess which to this day prevails throughout the Uganda Protectorate and
                        all other British mid Atrican Colonies. The Congo State is pursuing a
                        forestial policy far in advance of other colonists, by enforcing the
                        replantation of rubber trees and vines as fast as the old growth has been
                        sapped, thus insuring to future generations the results of Belgian wisdom. </p>
                    <p>One of the counts in the British indictment of the Congo State is that there
                        is no freedom of commerce in the Congo Basin. One need not dwell upon the
                        preposterous nature of that "freedom of commerce" defined by Mr. Morel and
                        his followers, which is the right of traders to incite the native to invade
                        these forests, steal the rubber product, and sell it to the trader. Private
                        and public property is nowhere open to unlawtul invasion. Rubber can be
                        purchased at a proper price by traders at Matadi as well as at Stanley Pool,
                        at Boma as well as at Antwerp. If the freedom of com- merce defined by
                        Congophobes were permitted, anarchy and tribal wars would ensue; all rights
                        of property would be disregarded, the larcenous proclivities of the African
                        negro race ericouraged, the native population decimated, and the forests
                        denuded. Congo law very properly forbids the buying of the product of
                        private property from anyone except the owner. The desire of adventurers to
                            <cb n="3"/> buy rubber direct from the natives is not a suffi- cient
                        reason for permitting the latter to tres- pass upon private property for the
                        purpose of stealing its product. Once establish a traffic on these lines and
                        you put a premium on the crime of theft and pit the spear of every native
                        against the other in his rubber-hunting areas. Space will not permit me to
                        enter at length into the real nature of the unjust campaign against the
                        Congo Government now proceeding in England and the United States, but I have
                        had sufficient to indicate some of the humane and sound motives impelling
                        the Congo Govern- ment in the administration of its territories for the
                        benefit and civilization of the native and the commercial and industrial
                        development and permanent institntion of the State ..</p>

                    <head>The Press and the Municipality</head>
                    <p>To The Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,-I was delighted to read the. Teading article in your issue of 9th inst.
                        re. the "Alexandria Municipality and the Press." On first reading, one is
                        struck with the idea that the writer was highly pleased that Mr. G. B.
                        Alderson's very wise and useful proposition was almost unanimously rejected,
                        but proceeding further we must admire his opening paragraph. It is quite
                        true that in England the Press are admitted to gatherings and func- tions of
                        all descriptions, it is the Press to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude
                        that can never be repaid. The Press invariably can be relied on to give an
                        accurate and' faithful. account of proceedings affecting the public
                        generally. It is to them that many things are brought forcibly to light
                        which would otherwise be left sleeping, things that shotild be published,
                        for the in- formation of those whose duty and right it is to have a voice in
                        the election to municipalities and other bodies. In the present instance, if
                        the proceedings of the Alexandria Municipality are as bad as the article
                        leads us to believe, it is time that a great alteration in the composition
                        of the Municipa- lity's representatives shonld take place. The refusal to
                        admit the representatives of the Press is almost on a par with a recently
                        formed institution amongst a certain class of Britishers in Cairo where the
                        proceedings used to be of such a character that the minntes had to be
                        submitted to the Chairman, who decided what was to go in-and what was not.
                        On protests being made, those who protested were told by the Chairman, "It
                        is not your place to tell me what shall go in the minutes. I am the best
                        judge." The consequences was that those whose duty it was to speak,
                        apparently had no right to open their mouths-a very one-sided affair and
                        totally against all usages and customs</p>
                    <p>f <cb n="4"/> The voting at Alexandria in favour of Mr. G. B. Alderson,
                        shewed public opinion to be in favour of "uprightness and truth," the voters
                        knew. in Mr. Alderson they had a man of sterling worth and qualities which
                        led all to hope great things trom his connection with the Municipality. What
                        a pity, a thousand pities, there are not more Aldersons-who fear no man, who
                        believe in right. I urge concentrated action, that the Govern- ment should
                        take immediate steps to look into the affairs of the Alexandria
                        Municipality, and if necessary appoint a special Commission to look into
                        matters,a Commission of independent- minded men-and shoqt out all those who
                        are against reforms. At present a special Commission is sitting on the
                        Railways, one may expect sweeping reforms. Is it not then the proper time to
                        have a few more Commissions in different departments in Bgypt, and have all
                        the cleaning and sweeping out done now, and at the same time ensure that
                        such gentlemen are appointed or elected to fill the vacancies which must
                        occur, and place Egypt on a good footing of honest straightforward working,
                        such gentlemen who would assist the Press in every conceivable manner to
                        publicly give voice to theirendea vours to cement and strengthen the
                        positions of those who have made the country what it is. That it is
                        prosperous there can be no doubt, that it would be more so if more men like
                        Mr. Alderson were in charge of affairs, who would not be hampered by one or
                        two members saying we do not want reform let us go on as we are going, sweep
                        them all out and put new hands into harness, we shall all appreciate truth
                        and right and above all let the Press be fully represented. In cases where
                        the Press are present, and matters which should not be made public, a hint
                        has only to be given, and the strictest 8 secrecy is maintained.</p>

                        <p>"Fireside Astronomy" is a very useful little work. It is a simply-worded
                            treatise suitable for the general reader on some little known and. often
                            misunderstood facts concerning thisscience. The articles which go to
                            make up this little book originally appeared in the English Me- chanic
                            and World of Science, and caused some discussion therein, chiefly owing
                            to the fact that they treated the science of astronomy from an entirely
                            new standpoint. The keynote of the whole work is to point out certain
                            po- pular errors into which 8o many persons of even good all-round
                            education frequently fall, and that it is in no way intended as a "text-
                            book," but merely as an entertaining story of the various branches of
                            astronomy for the general reader. The title "Fireside Astronomy" implies
                            that the treatise is a suitable one for reading at one's leisure. The
                            amateur astronomer re quiring a guide to the starry heavens, and what to
                            look for there with his telescope, is already well catered for, but the
                            "man in the street" .who simply wishes to learn the reason why certain
                            things happen in the sky above him, and has neither the time nor the
                            means to investigte the matter further, for himself, is not so well
                            looked after ; indeed, there are very few books which are not a great
                            deal too tech- nical for the individual mentioned. The pre- sent work

                    <dateline>LONDON, November 4.</dateline>
                    <p>Captain R. C. Pierce, 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Cairo, has
                        been seleted for the appointment of adjutant of the 3rd Battalion at
                        Enniskillen.</p>
                    <p>At Aldershot further drafts of Royal Engi- neors are being prepared for Malta
                        and Egypt, whither they will go about the middle of the month.</p>
                    <p>Second-Lieutenant C. S. Page, Royal Innis- killing Fusiliers, has been
                        transferred to the Army Service Corps.</p>
                    <p>At Woolwich an urgent order has been received for the manufacture of five
                        hundred 7'5 inch armour-piercing projectiles for H.M.S. Triumph, one of the
                        two first-class battleships purchased from the Chilian Government. The
                        secondary batteries of these two battleships are armed with the 7.5-inch
                        gun, which is a most powerful weapon for its calibre, far ahead of the
                        regulation 6-inch quick-firer and almost equal to the 9:2 gun.</p>
                    <p>The transport Dilwara left Southampton yesterday with troops on board for the
                        Medi -! terranean garrisons, Ceylon, and the Far East She embarked Nos. 7
                        and 8 Companies R.G.A. for Gibraltar, various infantry drafts, including one
                        of 80 men of the Worcester Regiment under Captain Bartholomew for the 2nd
                        Bat- talion in Ceylon, and details. At Gibraltar she embarks Nos. 1 and 2
                        Companies R.G.A. for Malta and conveys Nos. 92 and 93 Companies from Malta
                        to Ceylon in relief of Nos. 87 and 88, which go to Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>While great improvements have been effected in the range and precision of
                        modern ar tillery the efforts towards minimising the fric- tion caused by a
                        shell on its passage through the gun have not reaped a proportionate sue-
                        cess, and the life of a big gun is shorter than used to be the case. The use
                        of ball bearings inside the bore was introduced by an Ameri- ean during the
                        early part of this year, his method being to substitute spiral rows of balls
                        for the ordinary rifle grooves. Simultan- eously Mr. J. Stuart Forbes, of
                        Glasgow, obtained a patent in this country for the appli- cation of ball
                        bearings to artillery, but he fits them to the projectile, not to the gun,
                        thus effecting a great saving in cost. The patent could be adapted to guns
                        at present in use, and as the initial velocity would be far greater than at
                        present, the trajectory would be flatter and the range increased. The patent
                        opens up the possibility of dispensing with rifling alto- gether. Mr. Forbes
                        intends to carry out a series of experiments with a view to testing whether
                        in practice his invention will come up to the expectation formed of it.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>With the view of reducing expenditure, and at the same time promoting the
                        efficiency or the personnel, the Lords of the Admiralty have come to the
                        conclusion that in the interest of the Service it is eminently desirable
                        that the "weeding out" of small or more or less obsolete craft should be at
                        once commeneed. The upkeep of tliese vessels represents in the aggregate a
                        large sum annually without, it is held, any real benefit being derived
                        therefrom, and what is even of great importance, the officers and men by
                        whom they are manned are not sufficiently well trained in gunnery and
                        torpedo work owing to lack of opportunity in such small ships. Several smali
                        ships of slow speed and weak armament will be withdrawn from the China and
                        Cape Squadrons.</p>

                        premises. The tirm consequently purchased three years ago from Dr. Ahmed Bey
                        Hamdi a property of 3,500 square metres situated in the Sharia Mansour,
                        opposite the Helouan Railway station, and here they erected a large factory,
                        with a suite of offices on the upper floor. The new factory was completed in
                        1902, when the business was removed from the Abdeen to the Bab-el-Louk
                        quarter, and here they now employ no less than about a hundred workmen. The
                        firm likewise manufactures its own cardboard boxes, used in the cigarette
                        trade, the machine being driven by an electric motor. A visit to this, now
                        one of the leading cigarette factories of the Capital, is well worth
                        paying.</p>
                    <p>'The proprietors have just received intima- tion that their cigarettes have
                        been awarded the Grand Prix, the highest distinction obtain- able, at St.
                        Louis Exhibition, and they feel proud that the products of an Egyptian
                        concern have met with such an unique success abroad. But the firm, some
                        years ago, had likewise been awarded medals at several other International
                        exhibitions and they are purveyors by special appointment to H.M. the King
                        of Belgium, H.I.M. the Sultan, H.I,M. the Shah of Persia, H. R. H. the
                        Hereditary Princess of Saxe Meiningen, sister to the Kaiser, and the Khe-
                        divial Family. They have their own branches in London, Berlin, Munich,
                        Frankfort o/M, and Brussels, and agencies in all parts of the world, for
                        they not only export to Europe but also to nearly every country in the two
                        hemispheres. They have patented a hermetically sol- dered air-tight tin box
                        for exporting their products to India, the West Coast of Africa, and other
                        countries having a hot, damp or humid climate, and amongst their latest
                        novel- ties is a straw tube cigarette which has found much favour with their
                        customers. To suit all tastes they also manufacture cigarettes gold, straw,
                        or cork tipped, and of half a dozen different sizes.</p>

                    <p>About two years ago, when the two sons of the Kaiser were in Cairo, they
                        honoured the factory with a visit, and to commemorate the event, and by the
                        Royal Princes' special com- mand, the firm produced two descriptions of
                        cigarettes that bear the names of "Kronprinz" and "Prince Eitel" and which
                        they now supply at regular intervals to the two young Princes. They likewise
                        furnish the Imperial Court through their Berlin branch.</p>

                    <head>LORD DORMER'S ESTATES.</head>
                    <p>The many friends in Egypt of Lord Dormer, late of the Finance Ministry,
                        Cairo, will be interested to learn that he is setting to work in earnest to
                        improve his Buekingham estates, and among other works is building a new
                        church there. He is the thirteenth baron, and his family has been associated
                        with the county since the fourteenth century. It was in bluff King Hal's
                        day, however, that the Dormers became both rich and import- ant, Sir Robert
                        Dormer having been three times High Sheriff ot Beds and Bucks in that
                        monarch's reign. His son, like himself, was made a knight for valued
                        services, and to the next generation came the barony. This was in 1615, and
                        when the first baron died a year later, all his sons having predeceased him,
                        his grandson inherited the title, and twelve years later was created Earl of
                        Carnarvon. When the second earl died, however, the title died with him, and
                        it was a cousin who succeeded to the barony. The present peer, who is
                        forty-two, is a nephew of the late baron, who, though three times married,
                        left no surviving heir. He is a son of the late General Sir James Dormer,
                        the famous soldier and sportsman who was killed by a wounded tiger while on
                        a big game hunt in India. Until he succeeded to the barony four years ago
                        Lord Dormer was in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>During the month of October, 387 vessels passed through the Suez Canal, and
                        paid 10,265,079 francs and 92 centimes in transit and passenger dues. Of the
                        380 vessels, 204 went North and 176 South. 250 of these vessels were
                        British, 43 German, 31 French, 16 Dutch, 12 Austrian, 7 Italian, 3
                        Norwegian, 3 Turkish, 3 Spanish, 2 Russian, 2 Danish, and 1 American. These
                        vessels carried 22,350 passengers, of whom 20,816 were adults, 953 children,
                        and 590 gratis. The total transit and passenger dues collected by the Suez

                    <p>Miss Amelia Weymer, Appleton, Wis., writes: "Early last summer I contracted a
                        cold which seemed to hang on to me and could not be shaken off. From the
                        head it went to the throat) and then ! affected my lungs. My mother felt
                        very anxious and as we had used Peruna in the family before, she advised me
                        to try it. I was somchow very op-1 posed but was persuaded to try Peruns.
                        Using it one day conyinced me that It was no ordinary med- icine, within a
                        week I was much better and in two weeks I was well, and I felt much stronger
                        and in f much better health generally. I was perfectly sat- isfied with the

                    <p>Mrs. Msry E. Hoblit, 2501 Clinton avenue, Minneapolis, Minn., writes: "My son
                        suffered for three months with catarrh of the bronchial tubes which
                        threatened to become very serious. The doctors advised that he seek a more
                        favorable climate, but as he had heard of Peruna as a speciflo for lung
                        trouble he decided to give it a trial before he left! his family for an
                        expensive journey smong strangers. For six months he nsed it faithfully and
                        found that the trouble gradually disappeared and blessed health took its
                        place. In two months he was perfectly well and able to per- form his duties.
                        You have indeed a grateful mother's thanks."-Mrs. Mary Hoblit.</p>
                    <p>It is the pralse of those who have been cured by Peruna that makes this
                        remedy so popular and so extensively used. No advertisement could have
                        accomplished this result. Peruns cures the first stages of con- sumption by
                        removing the canse, which is chronic catarrh. The catatth having been cured
                        the cough and other dis- agreaable symptoms cease.</p>

                    <p>Pe-Ru-Na Never fails to cure catarrh wherever located.</p>
                    <p>HE medical profession has so thor- T oughly prejudiced the minds of the
                        people against patent medfeines that it is with great reluctance that
                        'Anyone can be persuaded to try such s remedy at first. In nesrly every one
                        of the thousands of remarkable cures that Peruna has made the patients had
                        to be persuaded by friends very strongly before they could lay sside their
                        prejudice agsinstit. A large multitude, of course, hold out ngainst the
                        persuasions of friends and die simply because they have allowed their minds
                        to be poisoned against this very excellent remedy. But fortunately there is
                        another large mhultitude of people who are able to shake off their prejudice
                        and try Peruns before it is too late. These people are rarely disappointed.
                        They generally try other remedies at the beginning of thefr troubles. They
                        allow a cold to develop into catarrh of the head. They allow catarrh of the
                        head to gradually become catarrh of the throat. They still keep using the
                        doctor's medicine, or some other ineffectual remedy. The catarrh stealthily
                        spreads down the bronchial tubes and reaches the lungs. Everybody then
                        becomes alarmed. Faith in the doctor begins to disappear. The patient
                        reaches a state of mind in which he is willing to try almost anything. A
                        bot- tle of Peruna is sent for. The first weck it produces a decided change
                        for the better. A few weeks' continued treatment cures the patlent. Then
                        another happy man or woman is added to the long list of people who are
                        praising Peruna. If you do not derive prompt and satis- factory results from
                        the use of Peruns, write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full ststement of
                        your case, and he will be pleased to give you his valuable ad- vice gratis.

                    <p>La Municipalité croit nécessaire d'attirer l'atten tion du public sur ce que,
                        ces derniers temps, les cas de rage sur les chiens ont considérablement
                        augmenté.</p>
                    <p>Dans le courant de l'année, quatre personnes, mordues par des chiens, sont
                        mortes de rage, dont deux le mois dernier. Comme le Service Sanitaire
                        n'avait pas été prévenu, les chiens avaient 616 laissés</p>
                    <p>en liberté.</p>
                    <p>De plus, il est à la connaissance de l'administra- tion que: 17 personnes ont
                        été mordues les deux derniers mois.</p>
                    <p>Il est indispensable que toute personne mordue par un chien, un chst, un
                        cheval ou autre animal susceptible de rage, avise immédiatement le service
                        vétérinaire de la Municipalité, téléphone N° 1150, pour permettre au service
                        d'attraper l'animal et de prendre les mesures requises.</p>
                    <p>Cet avis doit être donné même su cas où l'animal paraferait en parfaite
                        santé, car ce n'est qu'après examen qu'on peut reconnaitre s'il est atteint

                    <dateline>London, November 4.</dateline>
                    <p>Lord Lansdowne has communicated to the London Chamber of Commerce the result
                        of the negociations which have been going on with the Russian Government in
                        reference to con- traband of war. All our representations have been met in a
                        conciliatory spirit. Russia has agreed that certain articles originally,
                        declared to be absolutely contraband shall henceforth .be regarded as
                        conditionally contraband, ac- cording to the application for which they are
                        intended, and that the onus of proof shall lie with the captors - this last
                        a simple but most important clause. </p>
                    <p>The success or the failure of the inquiry into the Baltic outrage, on which
                        so much may hang for mankind, depends, indeed, almost absolute- ly on the
                        mutual uprightness of the parties. I trust that both will so act as to
                        strengthen the confidence of the world in this pacific plan for settling
                        formidable controversies between nations. </p>
                    <p>It has been hinted that the verdict the Court will find upon the evidence,
                        instead of being the truth, the whole truth, and nothing bat the truth, will
                        be something else- a some- thing dictated by political or racial prejudices.
                        If such a calamity were imaginable - which I do not believe- its occurrence
                        would destory for all time to come every hope which has been based on
                        settlementsof disputes otherwise than by war. </p>
                    <p>If Lord Rosebery does not aspire.to be the next Radical Premier, his
                        countrymen would like to know what his aspirations are. It has not been the
                        habit of our statesmen, with one great exception, of course, to put
                        themselves constantly in evidence when they have pro- fessedly renounced
                        political ambitions. Yet here is Lord Rosebery grasping at every oppor-
                        tunity of proclaiming his views just as if he was confidently expecting the
                        Royal sum- mons on the morrow of the first Government defeat. His long
                        speech at Trowbridge on Saturday. night would be explicable on that
                        supposition but is hardly to be explained on any other. </p>
                    <p>There is another explosion of dynamitic wrath at Berlin against England, this
                        time because Herrero insurgents driven into Bechuanaland are not instantly
                        captured and extradited. What would follow, were this somewhat impudent
                        demand granted, is suffi- ciently indicated by the National Zeitung's
                        admission that the poor wretches would be "court-martialled", the moment
                        they were banded over. Even if this country were willing to commit such a
                        shameful breach of hospitality and of humanity, it might well be inquired in
                        what manner Germany fulfilled the corresponding obligation when the parties
                        of Dutch rebels crossed over from Cape Colony into Great Namaqualand during
                        the Boer war. They were not only allowed to remain on German territory, but
                        it is not on recerd that they were either interned or deprived of their
                        arms. The Berlin correspondent of the Times recalls a still more striking
                        illustration of German. unfriendliness to Great Britain in analogous
                        circumstances. When a certain usurping Sultan of Zanzibar had to be dealt
                        with by bombardment by a British squadron as the only effective method of
                        suppression, the German Consul gave him asylum, and shortly afterwards
                        smuggled him away on board a German gunboat to the mainland. </p>
                    <p>Under the happiest conditions there is a spice of melancholy in an exile's
                        return to his own country. In the case of Mr. Kruger the coflin which
                        enclosed his dead body is but the symbol of the extinction of overweening
                        ambitions. Wrong-headed as he was, disastrous as were the results of his
                        lack of prevision, we cannot but stand bareheaded, as it were, before the
                        simple ceremony at Rotterdam. Enclosed in that which was the flag of the
                        Transvaal Republic, the mortal part of Mr. Kruger was placed on shipboard
                        for conveyance to the burial-place in South Africa which his some- time foes
                        have granted. In the shadow of that exile's coffin magnanimity forbids us to
                        be other than content with the decision which has made it possible for Mr.
                        Kruger to return to South Africa and to rest in South African Boil. </p>
                    <p>The suggested postal reform which, for convenience, has been designated
                        "C.O.D.," is undoubtedly looked forward to by the public generally with
                        hope. The proposal is <cb n="2"/> not so entirely approved by the section of
                        traders who waited on the Postmaster- General on Monday. I gather that it is
                        the smaller shopkeepers who are opposed to the change, and their cause was
                        stated clearly and fully by their representatives. It is thought that the
                        suggssted change, whatever its advantages to non-trading people, will have
                        the effect of injuring the small retailers, and throw a disproportionate
                        amount of busi- ness into the hands of the largest firms. Against this it
                        has been argued, with much plausibility, that the poorer class of shop-
                        keepers must be benefited by an arrange ment which promises to bring them
                        into closer relations with their natural customers. At the same time, it
                        must be owned that Lord Stanley had to listen on Monday to some powerful
                        arguments, and the opponents of change may well be content with his promise
                        of candid consideration. I should regret to learn that the suggested reform
                        has been hastily dropped, but that is not so. Lord Stanley believes it will
                        certainly come in due time, and it will not be hindered by careful
                        investigation beforehand. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Spencer Phillips, President of the Institute of Bankers, spoke weighty
                        words on Wednesday as to the growth of municipal indebtedness. Almost every
                        ratepayer has a general vague impression that his rates, as well as his
                        income-tax, are larger than they ought to be, and the knowledge that
                        municipal enterprise has become extravagantly ambitious in too many cases is
                        also fairly general. But few who are not expert financiers have any idea of
                        the full bearings of the evil. The total municipal debt of the country is
                        now half the National Debt, and yet there is no sign of any retrenchment of
                        the borrowing process. Against £92,000,000 of indebtedness in 1875 there are
                        £350,000,000 now ; and even more striking is the fact that, while the
                        rateable value of the property concerned has only increased from
                        $115,000,000 to £174,000,000, the annual burden has risen from £19,000,000
                        to £48,000,000. All this is not only a direct pull upon the ratepayer, but
                        it depresses the value of high-class securities and injures commercial
                        business. </p>
                    <p>The Free Church of Scotland has given formal notice that it intends to take
                        over hundreds of churches which it cannot fill, hundreds of manses for which
                        it has no ministers, and hundreds of missions which must go to rack and ruin
                        in its hands. In Scotland they are coming to think Shylock rather a moderate
                        character. </p>
                    <p>The establishment of separate courts of justice for children, which has been
                        much advocated lately, formed the subject of a special conference on
                        Wednesday at the Education offices of the L.C.C. The verdiet of the meeting,
                        which included representatives of a large variety of bodies connected with
                        the welfare ot children, was unanimous in favour of the compulsory provision
                        of separate places for dealing with police-court cases in which children
                        were concerned. It was pointed out that the magistrates, the L.C.C., the
                        Schoel Board, and the Home Office itself were all in favour of a reform
                        which would preserve children, many of them not guilty of any offence, from
                        the contaminating atmosphere of crime and criminals. </p>
                    <p>Few men will be more missed than Dan Leno, for there were very few in any
                        walk of life known to a larger section of the public, and perhaps none more
                        genuinely beloved. He was that rare thing, a real comedian, to whom wit and
                        humour were the natural, not the forced, expression of his mind, and if
                        there was an underlying vein of melancholy in his composition, as in fact
                        there was, though he so seldom allowed it to appear, it was because that is
                        inevitable to the true humourist. Infinite kindness of heart and a boundless
                        gift- of gaiety will carry a man a long way in any company, and it would be
                        difficult to set any limit to the popularity which they won for Leno among
                        the British public. </p>
                    <p>Some sensation has been created in the Strand by a couple of
                        respectably-dressed young men playing a piano organ, bearing a placard with,
                        "We are competent clerks, unable to find employment." The case may be
                        genuine, but a want-of-work outery such as has lately been raised invariably
                        produces numbers of undeserving appeals for help. At the time of the last
                        unemployed processions, well-fed navvies made a substantial income by
                        trundling barrel organs in fashionable thoroughfares at the expenditure of
                        little manual labour. </p>
                    <p>The steady increase of pauperism in London, which the latest returns of the
                        Local Govern- ment Board show, is very serious, The figures <cb n="3"/> for
                        last week show a remarkable increase for the fourth week of October. For the
                        second week of that month the paupers of London numbered 114,634 ; for the
                        third week, 115,866; and for last week, 117,120. Those figures exceed any
                        yet recorded, even in the worst years. Whether it is bad trade or
                        comfortable workhouses which swells the pauper ranks, the fact remains that
                        while the numbers have steadily increased by 3,000 a year for some years up
                        to now, this year shows an increase of nearly 7,000, and the appalling
                        number of 15,000 over that of 1901, which is by no means a favourable year
                        for comparison. </p>
                    <p>On looking into the subject more closely it is possible to distinguish some
                        of the causes which have produced an addition of 15,000 paupers to the ranks
                        within a little over three years. While duting that period the number of
                        outdoor paupers has increased by 5,500, the indoor poor have been increasing
                        at the rate of 3,000 a year, and now number over 8,000 above those in
                        workhouses and infirmaries in 1901. That London should be pauperised at this
                        rapid rate is enough to cause anxiety at Whitehall, for an increase of 8,000
                        indoor poor means a capital expenditure of more than three-quarters of a
                        million sterling, and an increase in weekly expenditure from the rates of at
                        least £5,000.</p>

                        publie to the fnoi thst Babies among Doge is at the present moment great- ly
                        on the increase. No less than four persons bave died from rabies in the year
                        1904, and of these two in the laat month. As the Vete inary Service was not
                        advised by these persons when they were bitten, the dogs were allowed to
                        remsin at large. Again, no less than 17 persons have been bitten to the
                        knowledge of the Municipality in the lait 2 montha. It is most essential
                        that anyone bitten by a dog, cat, horse, or any other animal should at once
                        advise the Voterinary Service of the Municipality (Tele. phone 1150) so that
                        the animal can be caughi and the necesssry precsutions taken. It shonld be
                        well understood that this shonld be done even shough the animal may appear
                        to be in perfeet heslth-for it is only by examinstion that it can be
                        asoertained if the animal is suffering from rabies. The Municipality are
                        determined to do their ut- most to remove this soourge-but they are almost
                        powerless unlees assisted by the publio.</p>
