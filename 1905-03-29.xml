                    <p>Our telegrams announce that the "Daily Telegraph" is advocating the$
                        strengthening of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and wo are told that this
                        policy of our London contemporary is receiving general approbation in the
                        City. Our present treaty with Japan may be taken to express the accepted
                        policy as far as concerns the matters with which it deals, by Great Britain
                        recognizes Japan's. Chinas her special interests in Mauchuna, aid her right
                        to take steps to protect them it stipulates that if in the protector oi time
                        interests Japan should at war with a third Power Great Britain will be, and
                        that if during sued war any other should join against Japan Great will than
                        take part in the war as me ally in Japan The war now going on is covered by
                        the treaty. Great Britain is neutral, but it any Power should come Russia's
                        assistance Great Britain must assist Japan. Thu treaty, as has just been
                        said, represents the accepted policy. But it doss not constitute a policy,
                        fur it is merely a fragment, dealing with special interests and specific
                        eventuates. It provides certain means for facilitating the default Oi
                        Japanese and of British interests in the Ear > East The eventualities which
                        it contemplates, I however, are only a part oi those which may l happen j
                        perhaps not the most immediately j probable part</p>
                    <p>In view of the recent victory of Japan, it might not be improbable that the
                        Russia autocracy, id order to save itself Iron revolu­tion at home, would
                        user atoll to tha utmost to obtain help from another Power. This
                        contingency, not highly pro liable, is quite within the of pos­sibility, and
                        for that event the Brit: h nation ought to be prepared, and the Government
                        in particular ought to be every respect ready. Readiness means having
                        decided beforehand on the necessary plans of campaign, including all
                        arrangements and the faros to be used, and not having when the time cines to
                        sit dews and deliberate if anything is to be done, and if | so what it is to
                        be. It would be natural: - sup-1 pose that after the flourishes of the

                    <p>been unready once ate quite capable of being unready again.</p>
                    <p>The treaty with Japan also touches on other possibilities. It refers to

                            information was conveyed by the lecturer as to the proper mode of
                            developing the vocal organs, and his description of the various
                            reasonant organs of the human frame- in themselves very lucidly
                            described-was rendered still more plain by a large diagram of the head
                            and throat, The importance of the proper management of the resonant
                            organs, nd the way in whic to best avoid the hindrances to good singing,
                            presented by the tongue, throatiness, etc., were fully set forth, and at
                            the close of the lecture the appreciation of the audiece as plainly
                            expressed. A vote of thanks to the reverend lectuer was proposed by
                            Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, KCMG, who presided, and was heartily
                            accorded. We hope that Mr.Rynd wll favor he society with many more of

                    <head>TERRIBLE ACCIDENT<lb/>THREE MEN BURIED ALIVE</head>
                    <p>A terrible accident occurred at Alexandria yesterday afternoon about 5
                        o'clock, by which three men lost their lives. In Stamboul street, just
                        behind Groppi's establishment, building operations are proceeding, and at
                        the time mentioned the foundations of the house being built gave way,
                        burying three native masons in the debris. Towards evening, the dead bodies
                        of two of the men were recovered, while the other remained buried under a
                        mass of earth and stone. From investigations which we have made, it appears
                        that at a depth of four metres these men were engaged in building up the
                        earth i nthe form of an arch. Th carelessness of native workmen is
                        notorious. It seems that in forming the arch they had taken away some earth
                        on the side of the escarpment. This weakened the layer of earth on top and
                        caused the landslip. Under the circumstances the blame for the unfortunate
                        accident must fall on the victims themselves, as no one but they can tell
                        the stability of their position. Had they been simple workmen, the
                        responsibility would lie with the employers, who should have capable
                        overseers.</p>

                    <p>We hear that a petition is circulating among the abonnes of the Khedival
                        Opera House (and obtaining numerous signatures), copies of which will be
                        addressed to the Minister of Public Works and to Lord Cromer, Mr Vincent
                        Corbett and Sir William Gastin. The petitiondeals with the decision of the
                        Socitete Artistique to bring an Italian company over in the season
                        1905-1906, in spite of the decision taken some time ago, and aproved by the
                        Government, to bring French companies over in alternate years. The
                        signatories of the petition complain of this breach of the regulations
                        pointing out that the arrangement previously made enabled good new operas
                        (which by the concession must be produced to the number of four a year) to
                        be brought before the Cairo public. They disclaim all nationalist bias and
                        assert that the plea of the societe Artistique, viz, that a good French
                        company cannot be procured, is utterly untenable. They therefore beg the
                        Minister of Public Works to intervene on behalf of the Government and the
                        public. In our opinion the best way out of the difficulty would be to revoke
                        the concession as soon as possible, and hand over the entire business to a
                        good impressario.. The proverb "Too many cooks" is alarmingly true in Egypt.

                        Egyptian officers, officials and employes of the Government of Suakin to
                        stand respectfully before your Excellency and to express their happiness on
                        your visit to this province and town. All the people of whatever station,
                        the richest and the poorest, the highest and the lowest, have taken this
                        oppurtunity to welcome you by their shouts and respond to the consideration
                        and goodwill you have ever shown to all. All whom you find around you are
                        anxious to assure you of their warm feelings and pleasure. The whole Sudan
                        recognises and is grateful for the wise and good administration of the
                        coutnry. The whole Sudan recognises and is ggrateful for the manner in which
                        the happiness and well-being of all classes are considered. Not only the
                        whole Sudan, but the whole world recognises the spledid way in which the
                        country has thriven during the years which you have been Sirdar and Governor
                        General of the Sudan, and wonders at the magnificent manner in which the
                        resources of the coutnry are being developed. It is true that during this
                        period all departments of the GOvernment have accomplished much, but in this
                        province we watch perhaps more keenly than others, the miles of railway
                        which are joining the Nile and Red Sea, and the plans for the development of
                        the ports of the Sudan. We know that all that has been the result of your
                        master spirit and encouragement. I am not able to express all that is on my
                        mind, but specially we would thank your Excellency for the honor of your
                        visit to us this evening, and in this way showing that you have a warm heart
                        and kind feelings for all those serving the Government of this country. I
                        ask all who are present to drink the health of his Excellency the Sirdar of
                        the Egyptian Army and the Governor-General of the Sudan, El Ferik Sir
                        Francis Reginald Wingate Pasha." The following congratulatory order was

                        the military officers and officials of the Egyptian Army and Sudan
                        Government for their admirable arrangements for his recetion, and for their
                        good and hard work to which the very marked improvement in the condition and
                        progress of the town and province since his last inspection in 1901 is due.

                        Monday in St. Mark's Church was quite private. It had not been possible to

                        "Gazette". The Bishop, who was attended by his acting chaplain, the Rev.
                        Canon Ward, inserted the following special prayers in a shortened form of
                        evening service. "In the faith of Jesus Christ we dedicate this memorial

                        good of Christ's poor, should stimulate the spirit of charity in others; and
                        whose watchful care of the interests of this foundation of St. Mark's has
                        left to his successors great possibilities for happy influence in the
                        chaplaincy which he served for so long a time. "Assist us mercifully, O

                    <p>MOUNTED INFANTRY SPORTS AT WADY NATROUN.</p>
                    <p>The M.L., under Major Pine-Coffin, D.S. O, old most successful sports on the
                        24th at the Oasis of Wady Natroun,, wbere they at present bolding their
                        quarterly encampment. The ground was very kindly lent, and every assistant
                        given by Mr. Bensilum, the hospitable manager of the Salt and Soda company.
                        The ground presented at most picturesque appearance, as nearly all the
                        Bedouins from the surroundings desert attended dressed in their beet gala
                        costumes, and all armed with long tint-lock guns, pistols, etc. Several of
                        them brought their families, or which a harem .lent was erected. The ladies
                        cooked very picturesque and seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. Quito a
                        novel sight was afforded by the monks from the neighboring Coptic
                        monasteries, who turned up in great force. Their sombre costume and black
                        turbans aflorded a striking contrast to the other spectators. The tug of war
                        between the three Motions -raw one of the most popular items. The final pull
                        between the Brigade Motion and the 2nd Royal Berks was a magnificent one,
                        and lasted about 12 minutes, resulting in a win tor the Berks. "The
                        'picketing out race" was won 'easily by the luniakiiling Fusilier section,
                        who completed their task in the short time of 12 minutes. The last race on
                        the program was a "bun and treacle race," which seemed far more pleasant to
                        watch than to take part in. The prizes were distributed at the end of the
                        sports by Mins Dolly Pine-Coffin. Amongst those present we noticed Major
                        Pine-Coffin, D.S.O., Mrs. Pine-Coffin and Master Miss Pine-Coffin, Mrs.
                        Lewellin, Capt. Nuuu, D.S.0., Ghumous Sarabamon, Bishop of Khartoum, Capt,

                        sports the Coptic Bishop of Khartoum mode a speech in classical Arabic, a

                        translation of the Bishop of Khartoum's speech: Ladies and Gentlemen,—We are
                        very pleased on this great day to have amongst us the commandant of the
                        British troops, and from the bottom of our hearts we wish him welcome. His
                        presence lighted the Wadi, and aaa the inhabitants of the place as well as
                        the priests bf the monasteries are much plesed with his visit. Before the
                        arrival of the commandant and the troops the sun had disappeared here and
                        now ho appears again. All the people hare and the manager of the Wady estate
                        am very much honored by his visit to us end I cannot find any words to
                        express the contentment of the priests on the occasion. We are praying God
                        to protect H.M. Edward VII, King of England, H.H. Abbas II, our Khedive, our
                        H. the Patriarch and his colleague, Father Samerion. It is by the request of
                        all the people of the Wady Natroum that I pronounce these few words, which I
                        am happy to say come from the bottom of my heart. I wish yon all, ladies and
                        gentlemen, prosperity and long life. FOOTBALL. McKEBVOR SHIELD. The above
                        teams met on the 23rd inst. at Abbearich to decide who should hold the above
                        trophy, kindly presented by the Hon. Mr. McKeevor. Loth teams received a
                        great ovation on entering the arena. At the appointed rime (or starting the
                        referee, Mr. R McAllister, D.C.M., lined his men out in the following order:
                        F. Company 1st, goal, Fortin; backs, Peggs and Page: half-backs,Calvin,
                        Collion: , and Edwards; forwards, Smyth, Harbinson, Duffy, Galbraith, and
                        Linton. P. Company 2nd, goal, McCallion; backs, Cohee and Reilley ;
                        half-back, Elliot, Templeton, and McTeague; forwards, Reford, Magee, Mullan,
                        Paton, and Judson Captain Magee guested correctly the spin of the coin and
                        decided to defend the roadside goal. About 800 would be pretest when Smyth
                        started the ball scrolling. Edward the first to get away and sent well into
                        goal, but McCallion saved well. On the kick-off Mullan got away and passing
                        out to his right Refold got possession and sent in a grasshopper to Parris,
                        who in saving conceded a corner. This was well taken by Buford, and Magee
                        getting the leather at his toe had no difficulty in scoring first blood for
                        the seconds, the custodian not having an earthly chance to save. On,
                        resuming Harbinson got on a good run and passing out to Smyth, who was given
                        offside, this relieved matters for a while The second pressed for a while
                        and Reford from a nice centre by Magee made the seconds 2 to nil amidst
                        deafening cheers. Shortly after this Judaea had a good chance to score, but
                        his shot went on the wrong side. The excitement was now intense as Paton,
                        with a beauty, recorded the third goal. Collins, Smyth, and Harbinson now
                        turned the tide by making tracks for McCallion, but the latter, along with
                        Cohee and Reilley, was all O. K. The right wing of the seconds was now doing
                        some grand work and gave Partis plenty to do, the latter being ably
                        supported by Peggs and Page. Shortly after halftime was announced, the
                        following being the score:— F Company. 2nd …………3 Goals F Company 1st... ...
                        ..........Nil Alter the usual refreshments both teams entered the arena once
                        more, The first thing noticeable was a good run by Beford, who after dodging
                        a couple of opponents sent well in to Partis, who saved finely. Play was now
                        carried towards midfield, but Smyth could not get away and Templeton got
                        away on his own and shot strongly into goal, Partis felling in the attempt
                        to save. Everything now rated in favor of the seconds, who added a filth
                        goal per Mulian. There was only one team in the game so for as one can
                        readily guess. The first eleven now woke up, but Smyth, when in a good
                        position to score, was given offside. This, however, did not keep them away,
                        and McCallion got plenty to do, which he did in a masterly fashion. However,
                        he had to bow down to Peggs, who scored the first goal for the first eleven
                        amidst cheers. This helped to pat the seconds on their mettle and Beford
                        grazed the crossbar. Shortly after the crossbar fell from a great shot from
                        Paton. Darkness was now setting in. Still the spectators urged their
                        favorites to go in and win; Fall rime was now approaching, as Page handled
                        the ball The free, however, proved unproductive, Duffy clearing. The referee
                        was very strict in his decisions. Mullan, Magee and Reford were now
                        combining well and Page could not master the right wing, who wore a terror
                        to the defense. Play was in midfield when the whistle sounded full time. The
                        fioal score was: F Company 2nd R. L... ... ... 5 Goals F, Company 1stR.L,,.
                        ... ... 1 Goal Mr.P.McAlliater refereed to the satisfaction of all

                    <head>GROSS CRUELTY TO BIRDS.</head>
                    <p>To toe Editor the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—I wish to bring before the notice of
                        your readers a moot distressing case witnessed by a party of four from this
                        house on Sunday, the 26th inst, when returning from the Barrage on No. 1 of
                        the Tramways Co.'s. Steamboats. A native had caught about 40 young sparrows
                        and tied them by the legs to a piece of string about 2 feet long- To get the
                        birds within this limit they were packed all-round the string, only the
                        heads arid breasts appearing, thus looking like a solid column of quivering
                        life. The string was tied so tightly that in some cases the birds in
                        struggling had severed their legs, others, more timid, had died. Over this
                        mass of life and death a crowd was gloating and bargaining for the birds,
                        themselves should one be too weak to move, it was thrown out to drown. We
                        obtained the lot, and liberated them. About two-thirds reached the banks,
                        some minus a leg, and the rest had either died, or were too weak to sustain
                        their flight and fell into the water. Should such a thing be tolerated 1 We
                        are, I think, getting beyond the barbaric age, and I, for my part, will do
                        my best to prevent a recurrence of such a ghastly sight, if it wore only for
                        the mute appeal of the birds themselves, and not considering the
                        "ascendancy" of man, which is only too obvious in this case. I do not know
                        whether a law exists relating to this, as If 1 had been acquainted with it,
                        the offenders would have been treated differently. — 1 am, eta Leonard H,

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. They are as
                        follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>Southern Italy</head>
                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE I. SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                    <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to Palermo and
                        down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and Catania. TAORMINA is one of
                        the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station
                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman

                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                        Riviera</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
