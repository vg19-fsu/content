                    <head>A MILITARY SCANDAL</head>
                    <p>The Report of the Royal Commission on War Stores in South Africa is not only
                        in itself a very painful document but it cannot fail to arouse serious
                        misgivings as to matters which did not fall within the purview of the
                        Commissioners. It is bad enough to be told that the total preventable loss
                        to the home taxpayer during the 22 months after the Peace lies somewhere
                        between three-quarters of a million sterling and one and a quarter million
                        sterling. But the real sting of the Report to our mind (says the "Globe")
                        consists of the general impeachment of the foresight and business capacity
                        of the implicated officials, civil and military. The Commissioners have
                        placed on record incidentally their conviction that no private firm could
                        avoid bankruptcy if it allowed its agents to deal with business matters in
                        the mode in which certain officers of high rank in the Army Service Corps
                        have dealt with the purchase and sale of supplies. The same reflection is
                        forced upon the reader of the Report, only with a much wider and. more
                        universal application. If an Empire like ours cannot get better yalue out of
                        its servants, and cannot exact a higher standard of ability and integrity,
                        the day of decline and fall cannot be very far distant. On the general
                        question of corruption, indeed, the Commissioners do not find that the,
                        sweeping innuendos of Sir William Butler and his colleagues have any solid
                        foundation in fact. <cb n="6"/>Certain officers and non-commissioned,
                        officers have gravely misconducted themselves, and their fate is left to the
                        military authority A censure, severe, but, in our judgment hardly severe
                        enough, is passed upon Colonel Morgan: it is all the more to be deplored
                        when the Commissioners admit that officer to be a man of exceptional
                        capacity in the Army Service Corps whose career had been one of rapid and
                        deserved success. It is very unpleasant, als, to find that the Army Service.
                        Corps regulations forbidding social inter course with contractors were
                        habitually disregarded by officials holding positions of great
                        responsibility. The Army Service Corps emerges from the inquiry with a heavy
                        stain on what had been a brilliant record, and its personnel will require a
                        drastic purging</p>
                    <p>But, as we have said before, the main interest of the inquiry lies in its
                        revelations of the incapacity of the Military authorities and of the War
                        Office to deal with a situation which must have been foreseen months before
                        it actually took shape. All through the spring of 1902 it was patent to
                        those in authority that the Boer resistance was weakening, that the end
                        might come at any moment, and that a prodigious amount of Army stores would
                        have to be disposed of. Lord Kitchener, indeed, had made provision for
                        winding up the financial side of the war by appointing Major Armstrong as
                        Financial Adviser to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief; and the ink
                        was scarcely dry on the Vereeniging treaty when he created the sales
                        department for taking over all surplus stores, and entrusted its
                        organization to Colonel Morgan, who, up to that date, was fully deserving of
                        the confidence of his superiors. Unhappily, Lord Kitchener left Africa
                        almost immediately after the war was at an end, and from that date chaos
                        ensued. The South African military command was divided into three, but
                        through an omission, the responsibility of which is not travel, Major
                        Armstrong was given no place in the reconstruction. And thus a post which
                        Lord Kitchener considered of vital importance during the critical period of
                        demobilization and the disposal of supplies and stores was left in abeyance.
                        Worse than this, the detailed arrangement, administrative and financial,
                        necessary for carrying the division of the command into practical working
                        operation" seems to have altogether escaped the attention of the
                        Quartermaster General's department for nearly three months, while the
                        Finance Department of the War Office issued no instructions at all. One
                        step, however, was taken towards the end of August. Orders came out from
                        England recalling Colonel Morgan, and appointing Colonel Hipwell as Director
                        of Supplies in his place. This substitution was not due to any distrust of
                        Colonel Morgan, but to a mere pedantic adhesion to the principles of
                        seniority, regardless of experience and capacity. The Commissioners acquit
                        Colonel Hipwell of direct misconduct, but they make their opinion of his
                        unfitness for the post perfectly apparent.</p>
                    <p>Among the consequences of Colonel Morgan's recall was the enormous loss
                        sustained by the working of the local contract system. It was originally
                        devised by him with the approval of Lord Kitchener, and entailed the
                        disposal on the spot of the surplus stores to local ontractors, and their
                        re-purchase from time to time without drawing fresh supplies from home.
                        Under an exceptionally capable officer it might possibly have succeeded,
                        though the odds are strongly against it; and when once the fatal
                        entanglements with Meyer (Limited) had been entered into, its fate was
                        sealed. Colonel Morgan was largely, but not solely, responsible for this
                        arrangement, and his conduct in getting a highly-paid berth in that concern
                        for his brother was most censurable. Had he remained at the head of affairs,
                        his knowledge and ability might have checked some of the grosser abuses, but
                        Colonel Hipwell was a child in the hands of the Philistines. He had not
                        devised the system of local contracts, and had had no part in its
                        recommendation, But he and his subordinate, Captain Limond, not only
                        accepted it without examination or protest, but with a whole-hearted
                        devotion worthy of a better cause they strove to give the system the
                        appearance of a working concern, "they sacrificed public money, abandoned
                        legal rights and equitable claims, and by continual subsidy and concession,
                        succeeded in giving to the contractors a false semblance of activity." The
                        miserable story of the contractors and their victims, of the criminal
                        carelessness of some officers, of the incredible recklessness of others, was
                        told in the daily reports of evidence taken before the Commission. The real
                        guilt lies with those who allow so vital a department of the Army to be
                        improperly, and insufficiently staffed, and with the War Office clerks in
                        the finance department ar home, who neglected the whole series of
                        transactions in South Africa, and resented all efforts at inquiry. One of
                        these, a worthy successor of Tite Barnacle in "Little Dorrit," suggested
                        that if the Controller and Auditor-General persisted in his inquiries he
                        should be "told to mind his own business." The Coar missioners have also to
                        complain of the carelessness and indifference of the military authorities in
                        South Africa, and it is apparent that the inquiries prosecuted under their
                        directions in the sub-Continent met with ill-disguised obstruction. The
                        Commissioners have discharged a most difficult and invidious task in at
                        manner commensurate with their high reputation</p>

                    <p>LONDON, Wednesday, August 15. In the course of a recent audience granted by
                        the King to Lord Cromer the position of affairs in Egypt was fully gone
                        into. His lordship acquainted his Majesty with the principles of the
                        Government working, pointing out the reforms that are necessary to the
                        improvement of Egypt's condition, more especially the anomalies arising from
                        the existence of the Capitulations. I understand that Germany is fully in
                        accord with the other European nations, as to the advisability of modifying
                        there in the interest of all concerned. The suggestion that the Kaiser wiil
                        at to-day's interview with King Edward suggest any bargaining is outside the
                        mark. There is every reason to believe that the scheme formulated in Lord
                        Cromer's last annual Report, as to modifying the Capitulations, will shortly
                        take shape with a view to obtaining the consent of the countries interest-
                        ed and with the object of putting the proposed reforms into execution with
                        as little delay as possible. It is realized that German interests in the
                        Capitulations are no greater than those of the smallest European nation, and
                        there can be no question of any bargaining. </p>

                    <head>Germany and Egypt.</head>
                    <p>The "Times" publishes the following telegram from Berlin: Ever since the
                        settlement of the Akabah dispute, and more particularly since the Denish-
                        wai incident, British policy in Egypt has been persistently subjected by the
                        German Press to malicious and ill-informed criticism. The pree cautionary
                        measures which the British Government has seen fit to adopt in view of the
                        restlessaners and unsettled feeling in Egypt have been interpreted as the
                        first step towards the overthrow of the Capitulations. Lord Cromer's
                        proposals for the amelioration of administrative and judicial conditions
                        have been similarly misconstrued. Upon the strength of these
                        misrepresentations it has been suggested that Egypt should be made the
                        subject of international discussion, and that in compensation for waiving
                        her rights under the Capitulations) Germany should receive sole control over
                        the proposed terminus of the Baghdad Railway. In the circumstances, Sir
                        Edward Grey's statement in the House of Commons on Saturday week that there
                        is no intention of converting Egypt into a British Crown Colony or of
                        handing it over to Turkish administration will have a salutary effect. It is
                        not without significance that in its report of Saturday's debate the German
                        semi-official Telegraph Agency ignored this portion of the Foreign
                        Secretary's speech but his words will nonetheless be understood in those
                        quarters in Berlin and in Cairo which are responsible for these
                        maneuvers.</p>

                        suddenly last Wednesday evening, at the school, of heart failure, at the age

                        circumstances of the murder of the station-master and pointsman at Fashn,
                        which took took place a few weeks ago, shows that it was committed by tour
                        Bedouins, who had been incited by Abd. el-Kadir, son of Lamloum Bey
                        el-Saadi, the Omdeh of the Fawaid tribe. The criminals have all been
                        arrested; and Lamloum Bey has been suspended from the omdehship. The
                        official report gives the following account of the murder: Shortly before
                        the crime was committed, Abdel-Kadir betook himself to a public house at
                        Pashn, which the Moa dirieh had placed "out of bounds," and the head
                        ghaffire resorted to strict measures to bring him out. Abdel Kadir became
                        greatly enraged and threatened the ghaffir that be would put him in a spare.
                        He accordingly called four of his Bedouin followers and, filling their
                        pockets with money, ordered them to go and kill the station-master and the
                        pointsman, with a view to getting the ghaffir suspected of the murder, bat
                        the plot failed. </p>

                    <p>PARIS, Wednesday August 15. A telegram from Jaffa to the "Echo de Paris",
                        says that the members of the Turco- Egyptian Boundary Commission have fallen
                        into complete discord over certain important points. The result is that the
                        situation is exactly the same as it was before the conflict between the two
                        countries. Our Constantinople Correspondent writes:- According to a rumour
                        among circles which are ordinarily well-informed, serious disagree ments
                        have cropped up over the differences which have hindered from the star the
                        nego tiations for the delimitation of the Sinai boundary. To-day these
                        negotiations clash over the question as to whether the three oases which are
                        situated at the starting point of the line of demarcation should tall to
                        Egypt or to Turkey. These oases incontestably belong to Egypt, but the Turks
                        are now claiming them. </p>

                    <head>GERMAN INFLUENCE IN TURKEY</head>
                    <p>The progress of German influence in Turkey is directed by M. Jean Rodes, the
                        Special Correspondent of the ' Bolair at Constantinople. M. Rodes comes to
                        the conclusion that, though Germany has acquired greater material interests
                        in Turkey than England possesses(excluding Egypt). These interests are still
                        inferior to those of Prance. Statistics of the railways, the chief factor of
                        German penetration, show that France holds 1,553 kilomètres, Germany 1,453,
                        and Austria 1,205. England has only 516. The Germans managed to purchase a
                        large block of shares in the Austrian line on the death of Baron Hirsch, but
                        the greater part of the capital is in French hands. Undoubtedly the Baghdad
                        Railway would change the present state of things to the advantage of
                        Germany, but when it is remembered that an appeal had to be made to the
                        French capital to construct the first section, it may be doubted whether the
                        line will be finished for many years to come. It can hardly be supposed that
                        the assistance given by Preach financiers, with the approval of the will be
                        continued indefinitely in view of the change in French policy and the
                        strongly political aspect of the railway enterprise in question. M. Rodes
                        quotes an official in charge of one of the principal Turkish lines as
                        stating that the kilomètric guarantee for the existing section is very
                        inadequate. The Turkish Government has to meet a deficit of 13,631 fr. per
                        kilomètre. The surplus of the Anatolian Railway receipts is being used for
                        this purpose, but it is evident that such an expedient would be
                        impracticable for the whole railway, though it may serve for one section.
                        The only source of revenue yet discovered for enabling the line to be
                        continued, with the necessary guarantee, is the proposed increase of 3 per
                        cent, in the Customs tariff; but this surplus is claimed for the Ottoman
                        Public Debt and for the reforms in Macedonia. Under these circumstances it
                        may be affirmed that the Baghdad Railway will not be completed for at least
                        sixty years, if at all. M. Rodes thinks that German influence in Turkey is
                        on the wane. Germany's attitude over the seizure of one of her steamships
                        caused great irritation; and Turkish officials observe that Germany's
                        friendship has not averted the humiliations undergone by the Porte. </p>

                        indemnity to the family of the native who was found dead at Sersina on the
                        afternoon of the Denishwai incident, and who, it was alleged, was killed by
                        a soldier of the party which was sent out by Captain Bostock. The papers to
                        which we refer remarked that an English officer, accompanied by an inspector
                        of the Ministry of the Interior, went to Sereina to pay an indemnity to the
                        dead man's family. We are able to atste, however, that the only recent
                        occasion on which an officer of the Army of Occupation has visited Sersion
                        accompanied by an inspector of the Ministry of the Interior was at the time
                        of the inquiry made by the Parquet into the affair, when, in accordance with
                        the request of that Ministry, Captain Somerville was appointed to represent
                        the Army of Occupation, and was accompanied by Mr. Moberly. As is already
                        known, no evidence at all was forthcoming that the man had been killed by
                        one of the relief party, and it can therefore be safely assumed that in the
                        absence of any such evidence an indemnity would be paid. </p>

                    <p>Our Damanbour Correspondent reports that on the morning of Tuesday a
                        collision between two trains took place on the Delta Light Railway line at
                        El-Messein station. While the up passenger train No. 1 was at the station,
                        No.2 down train entered at full speed, and owing to the points not being
                        properly set the trains collided with each other. Three passengers were
                        injured, and damage was done to the trains. The scene after the collision
                        was one of the greatest confusion, the large number of people who were
                        traveling by the down train to Delingst market jumping out of their
                        carriages and emitting loud cries of alarm. </p>

                        adamant against woman's larer, is inclined to marry. The story comes from
                        India, and the lady's name is not mentioned; bat it it is trae, she will
                        receive hearty congratulations on ber capture of the General Commanding.

                        Diplomatic Agent, has left Cairo for Constantinople, and during his absence
                        will be replaced by Mohamed Fegib Bey, secretary to the Agency. Mr. P. H.
                        Parker, District Jedge of Nicosia, Cyprus, is to act as Chief Justice on the
                        departure of Sir Joseph Hutchinson for Ceylon, to which colony he has been
                        promoted as the sacoessor of Sir Charles P. Layard, who has retired. Mr.
                        Parker has been in Cyprus for the past sixteen years, and has served as
                        President of the six District Courts of the Island, and has acted as Paisne
                        Judge on three occasions. He was formerly connected with British Honduras,
                        where he noted both as Attorney-General and as Chief Justice. He has been in
                        the Colonial Civil Service for twenty-two years. Mrs. Walter Draper, whose
                        sad bereavement of her little daughter we mentioned last week, sails with
                        her niece this afternoon by the S.S. Seti for a stay in Scotland. Captain
                        Dudley de Chair, RN., who is of the last election of honorary members of the
                        R. Y. 8, acquired the useful knack of creating a favourable impression quite
                        early in life. When he was a middy ashore in Egypt he got anapped up and
                        conveyed a prisoner to Arabi Patha. He was such a nice boy that Arabi handed
                        him over for safe custody to the ladies of the harem. He so delighted them
                        that when the time came for the retorn of their captive there was a
                        unanimous objection to letting him go. El Bimbashi T. G. Dalby, 3rd
                        Battalion, has been struck off the strength of the Egyptian Army. The
                        merchants of Kengh express antisfaction. with the action of Saba Pasha,

                        ECHECHES</head>
                    <p>Dans sa séance da 3 juillet 1906, la Déléga tion a bien voulu me charger de
                        rechercher les meilleurs moyens pour le transfert, eu des en- droits
                        appropriés, des éohèches actuellement éparpillées sur plusieurs points de la
                        ville. L'étude que j'ai faite de la question me permet de vous soumettre les
                        observations et propositions suivantes: Les échèches ou, en d'autres termes,
                        les habi tations rudimentaires pour les olasses pauvres indigènes se
                        répartissent comme suit: 1 Les échèches de Gabbari; 2" les échèch s de
                        Toabguish: 3° les échèches du Lazaret ou Chatby; 4 les 6 hèches de Ragheb
                        pacha et de Gebel El Guella. -La Délégation a eu à s'occuper de ces dillé-
                        rentes agglomérations et à pris en ce qui les concerne des décisions dont
                        l'exécution a rencontré des obstacles de diverses natures. C'est ainsi que
                        malgré que la Délégation ea le droit, en conformité de l'arrêté ministériel
                        da 11 mai 1895, de prendre des décisions tendant à la fermeture de ces
                        habitations en temps d'épidémier, ce Collège a estimé que l'adoption de
                        pareilles mesures, sans assurer en même temps d'autres gites aux habitants
                        des échèches, entrainersit des inconvénients plus grande que le maintien de
                        ces échèches elles- mêmes, car elle aurait pour conséquence que les
                        habitants des locaux contre lesquels les décisions de fermeture seraient
                        prises, cherche- raient à se répandre au milieu des quartiers dont les
                        habitations répondent aux conditions de l'hygiène et leur porteraient ainsi
                        le tort le plus grave. Un exemple de cette situation a été fourni à la suite
                        de la disparition desi 6ohèchos de Ras-el-Tine dont les habitants se sont
                        répandas dans les quartiers environcants en trafoant avec eux la malpropreté
                        qui les caractérise. Aussi la Délégation a t-elle pensé qu'avant de recourir
                        à l'exercice des droits qai lai sont conférés, il y avait lieu pour elle de
                        rechercher les emplacements auxquels les échèches pourraient être
                        transférées en adoptant pour chaque agglomération les convenances de sos
                        habitants. Les avantages de ce transtert sont incontestables; en effet, il
                        permet de donner plus d'extension aux quartiers ch l'existence des échèches
                        constituait un obstacle à leur développement; il permet à l'autorité
                        sanitaire de prescrire dans les nouvelles babi- tations qui seront érigées
                        toutes mesures d'by- giène et de propreté répondant aux exigences modernes,
                        de telle sorte qu'on obtiendra ainsi la disparition d'an des dangers les
                        plus grands qui menacent non seulement les habitants des échèches, mais
                        aussi tous les habitants de la ville qui sont à la merci d'ane contagion que
                        read plus facile la proximité de ces habitations malsaines. Ea dehors de ces
                        deux avantages essentials, Is population musulmane de la ville a um intérêt
                        direct important au transfert d'une partie des échèobes, soit celle de
                        Toabgaich la zone occupée par ces échèches est en effem depuis longtemps
                        réservée à l'élargissement du cimetière de la Colonne Pompée et on mi que
                        tant que ce cimetière se trouvera à l'étroit comme il l'est actuellement, il
                        sers impossible de remédier à l'état défectuerx où il se trouver et dont
                        tout le monde se plaint. Pour toutes ces raisons la tâche dévolse à la
                        Délégation consistant à assurer les moyens tendant au transfert des échèches
                        et à leurs amélioration est une des plus importantes qei paissent s'imposer
                        aux préoccupations d membres de ce Collège, car il s'agit non seule ment
                        d'un boscin sanitaire à satisfaire, mais sassi d'an devoir social que les
                        honorab'e- membres auront à coeur de remplir. </p>

                        suivant lequel la veute do Grand Continental Hotel aurait été conclue pour
                        la somme de 600,000 livres. Or, on affirme que otte vieille rumeur, té

                        détachons d'une lettre de Paris, arrivée par le courrier d'hier, les lignes
                        suivantes: "Lal quidation de fin Juillet peat être mar quée d'une croix
                        Loire dans les annales de notre Bourse, en raison des cours de compen sation
                        qu'elle a fait enregistrer sur les fonds rus-es et spécialement sur le 5%
                        nouveau de 1906. Il anflit de mettre en regard les derniers cours de
                        compensation de ce fonds pour mesurer toute l'étendue de la baisse qu'il a
                        sabie: le 31 Mai il compensait à 97, le 15 Jain à 90, le 30 Jnin à 88,25, le
                        15 Juillet à 84,60, eufia le 31 Juillet à 81,75. Ea deux mois la perte n'a
                        pen été inférieure à 10 1/4 points. Et depuis la liquidation il est encore
                        retombé à 78,50, ce qui fait un écart de 13 1/2 points avec le cours de
                        compensation de fin Mai. Cette chute précipitée met en évidence la faate qui
                        a été commise lors de l'émission de cet emprunt. Tout le poids en a été
                        laissé à la spéculation, si bien qu'une grosia partie en est encore
                        flottante, et dans les circonstances ac tuelles, elle ne trouvera pas
                        facilement à se classer dans les portefeuilles." Les recettes des Tramways

                        below those of last Thursday. The decline was chiefly due to the fall in
                        prices in New York and New Orless, apon the publication of the Basess
                        report, and to Mr. Price salling out his long interest. Our Market being
                        closed for 3 days whes the re port was issued, so doubt intensified the at
                        pressure to sell hyre when it re-opened, and the fall has been taken full
                        advantage of by the short interest to farther manipolate prices down. We

                            military uniform and who welcomed him by kissing him on both obeeks.
                            Their Majesties motored to Friedrichshof Castle amid the ringing of

                            from dawn till eight o'clock in the evening. Seven persons were killed.
                            The number of wounded is unknown. It is admitted that most of the town
                            has been burned. Athens is in mourning; the theatres are closed. A

                        that Arabi would see me, and soon after the man came in. This is the picture
                        of him as I saw him.</p>
                    <p>Even now, in his seventieth year, he is a big man; in his prime he must have
                        been immense. White hair and beard; a broad, thoughtful forehead, surmounted
                        by the Turkish tarboosh; kindly eyes, dulled a little by age, but lighting
                        up wonderfully when he talks about things which interest him; a straight,
                        powerful nose; a large mouth, which must once have been hard and cruel, now
                        softened by adversity. Though the day is warm he wears an overcoat, and he
                        walks heavily on a massive ebony stick.</p>
                    <p>We begin in English with the customary inquiries, "How is your health and
                        that of your family?" This topic exhausted, I am subject to a catechism as
                        to the state of my health, the length of my stay, my married happiness, and
                        my age.</p>
                    <p>Conversation languishes. I have drank my coffee, and be appears to wish me to
                        go. I try him in French, but we get no further than the weather and the
                        cotton crops, in which he would seem to take but a scant interest.</p>
                    <p>This will never do. My guide whispers, "He will not talk to day; we had
                        better go." But I refuse. "Ask him in Arabic if he is rich and happy," I
                        say, with a heaven-born inspiration that breaks the ice; he is not, and he
                        wishes the world to know it.</p>
                    <p>"Happy" he asks, scornfully. "How can I be happy? I am old and friendless.
                        The companions of my youth have died. The men who still survive from the
                        'eighties dare not come to see me, for fear of displeasing the
                        Government."</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, this is not quite accurate. I had the privilege of
                        speaking with a most intelligent Egyptian patriot, and he voiced a suspicion
                        which surprised me greatly. "Arabi!" he cried, scornfully, when I mentioned
                        the name to him as one of the great patriots of Egypt. "Arabi is no patriot.
                        He is the creature of the English. He sold his country to the English for
                        the gold on which be now lives. He, and he alone, is responsible for British
                        ooaapation. I would kill him with my own hands if I knew where to find him."
                        It is a twisted view, of course, which only an Oriental would think of, but
                        if it is generally held--and, so far as I can discover, it is--one can quite
                        understand why Arabi finds himself friendless. Anyway, the idea that he is
                        responsible for British intervention is true enough to a certain extent,
                        for, if there had been no military revolt, then the European concert might
                        have muddled along till this very day.</p>
                    <p>But while this thought is running through my mind Arabi is speaking
                        energetically to the interpreter</p>
                    <p>"They have taken away my lands, these English; they have deprived me of my
                        civil rights. I cannot vote; I cannot make a contract; I am as a dead man.
                        This me a pension of £600 a year to support myself and my family. Why, it is
                        only enough to feed a dog with."</p>
                    <p>"But," I venture, perhaps it is the rule that all those who took part in the
                        rebellion should be deprived of their civil rights ?" "Not so," he replied,
                        energetically. "Mohamed Sami was liberated, and had his civil rights
                        restored. And if I was guilty of treason so also was Mohamed Sami, and more
                        so." "What do you feel to day of the rising of '81 Do you still feel that
                        you were in the right ?"</p>
                    <p>Arabi straightens himself. "Listen," he says, impressively. "and I will tell
                        you." And this is what he told me, sitting in the twilight of the faded
                        room, beating heavily with his stick upon his hand.</p>
                    <p>"The history of Egypt since the time of the Pyramids is a dark story. It is
                        the history of oppression, of cruelty, of dark deeds. done openly. The
                        Egyptians were slaves, for they had no protection from their masters. To our
                        oppressors everything was lawful. We had no rights, no security; our wives,
                        even, were not our own. There was corruption and and extortion everywhere.
                        Ismail ground us to the earth.</p>
                    <p>"Now, I, a fellah, a son of the soil, saw all these evils, and, with one or
                        two others, I would have them put right. We did not conspire, but we asked
                        for just government. Then, one day, we were invited to the palace, and they
                        treacherously arrested us. The army, which loved me, when it heard, came. I
                        wrote to the British Consal for help, feeling sure that England would be on
                        the side of justice. But no help came. I lit the torch of liberty, and
                        England put it out, "Disappointed? Ah, indeed, you are right. We did not
                        know what to do. And yet I would not leave the country. The French Consul
                            <cb n="3"/> offered me £500 to go to France, but I refused. I loved my
                        native land too well.</p>
                    <p>"The whole of the country was with me for reform. We had all suffered
                        together, and we would all have shared the good results of the triumph of
                        right over wrong."</p>
                    <p>"But those massacres of Alexandria, when they killed men and women and little
                        children. What of them; surely they were not in the cause of liberty?".</p>
                    <p>"No, they were terrible, and we did all in our power to repair the fault. But
                        there was some excuse for the people. They were ignorant, they were excited,
                        and they saw foreign warships in the bay of Alexandria. They said amongst
                        themselves that the foreigners had come to take our country."</p>
                    <p>"Were you present at the bombardment?" I ask.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I was there, and I did my best for my country, but we never expected to
                        have to fight the English; we were not ready for the bombardment when it
                        came.".</p>
                    <p>"We are very proud in England of a little ship called the Condor, which ran
                        up under Fort Marabout. Did you see the actual thing happen ?"</p>
                    <p>"No, I did not see that; I was at the other end of the town; but they told me
                        of it. It was a brave thing to do, for she was a little ship, they say. The
                        captain must have been a good man."</p>
                    <p>"And what happened after that?" The fire in the old eyes dies down; I see
                        again a very old, broken man before me.</p>
                    <p>"There was the battle, and my unprepared troops fled. I was arrested; they
                        tried me, and sent me to Ceylon."</p>
                    <p>"Were you well treated there ?"</p>
                    <p>"Yea, they treated me very well, and, as I told you, I was far happier there
                        than in Egypt. My prison was no prison. I could travel about the island; and
                        when I travelled there was a special train for me. When distinguished guests
                        came to visit the island they always wished to see me, and there was my
                        special chair ready for me. I had a very pleasant interview with your Prince
                        of Wales when he came to the island, I sitting in my chair and talking with
                        him as one man to another.</p>
                    <p>"Ah, it would have been better if I had stayed there and died there. I have
                        written again and again to Lord Cromer and the Khedive to allow me a little
                        more money for my family. I had a hundred thousands pounds' worth of
                        property when they took me. Now I have nothing but the six hundred pounds a
                        year that the Government allows me. It is hard."</p>
                    <p>He is very tired, and the excitement of speaking of these things has wearied
                        him. We rise to go.</p>
                    <p>"Tell me," I ask before we begin our final salutations, "if occupation had to
                        come, would you prefer British, or French, or Turkish rule "</p>
                    <p>"There need have been no occupation," ha replies, impressively; "but since it
                        must be, the English are the best masters, They are fair, they rule the
                        country well. Yes, the English have done well what I tried to do, and, if
                        Egypt cannot be free, we must be content that she is prosperous."</p>

                    <head>A CHRISTIAN REFORMER OF MOHAMEDAN WOMEN.</head>
                    <p>Prince Nicholas of Montenegro lately signed an ediot ordering that henceforth
                        no Mohamedan woman should appear in the streets with her face covered by
                        "yashmak" or other Bort of veil. All and every Turkish woman had ja future
                        to show the full beauty of her face to the free and happy men-subjects of
                        his Royal Highness, just as her Christian sisters do. It is said that the
                        Turkish women, or rather the Albanian women of Mohamedan faith, are
                        delighted by the reform.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, their husbands, fathers, and brothers as stupid retrogrades
                        are simply hor rified At a principal morque of Dulcigno a great meeting was
                        held under the guidanos of the Principal Mufti. Learned Chadjas paad the
                        passages from the Horan, ordering the womenfolk of the true believers never
                        to ap pear outside their own homes without covering on head and face. They
                        declared that, although his Royal Highness was a mighty rules, he could not
                        change the rules established by God's great Prophet. A deputation was sent
                        to Cettiaje to make humble representation to the Prince. But the
                        constitutional antoorat of Montenegro answered the Koran with states-
                        manlike conclusiveness: "What I bave said, I have said!"</p>
                    <p>Thereupon the true believers began rapidly to sell their houses and lands and
                        emigrate with their closely and thickly veiled women to "the White Soudar
                        on-Boyana," the ospital | of North Albania. This was throwing discredit on
                        the princely reformer. A new edict was published declaring that every
                        Mohamedan who is foolish enough to emigrate because of the edict on yashmaks
                        forfeits ipso facto all his immovable property which will be then confi
                        cited for the benefit of public charities! A German merchant of Dalcigno
                        suggested then that the Mufti should write a Masbata, or humble petition, to
                        the great friend of the Khalif, the mighty Padishah of the Alamani. Never a
                        greater compliment was paid to the genins of the Kaiser than this one coming
                        from Dalcigno of Adria! And as just now Prince Nicholas has himself received
                        a compliment from the Kaiser in the shape of a German Minister to Cettinje,
                        it is hoped that it will not be difficult for the friend of Pan-Islamism to
                        save the faces of the Mohamedan women of Montenegro by saving their
                        "yashmake."</p>

                    <p>PROBABLE DISPERSAL.</p>
                    <p>The heavy financial loss which Lord Amberst of Hackney has sustained will, it
                        is understood by the "Tribune," lead to the dispersal of the famous
                        collections at Didlington Hall.</p>
                    <p>The Oriental collection of Lord Amherst is probably only surpassed by that of
                        the Dake of Northamberland at Alnwick, and comprises works of art and
                        literature that are celebrated all over the world. The Egyptian collection,
                        which has occupied more than forty years in gathering, is arranged in a
                        special museum, and contains some of the finest mommies that have come to
                        England, for the formation of the museam, commenced at a time when there was
                        no restriction on the removal of antiquities from Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The most important part of the collection, however, is that of the
                        antiquities obtained from the excavations which Professor Petrie and Mr.
                        Howard Carter carried out for Lord Amherst at Tel-el-Amarna in 1892. The
                        work upon the site of the remarkable city, built by the heretic Pharaoh
                        Amenophis IV., in a o 1450, resulted in the recovery of some beautiful
                        specimens of the unique art of the period which totally differs from that of
                        the Theban school. Among the finest specimens are small composite statoes in
                        alabaster and fleshcoloured jasper of the King and his young and beautiful
                        Queen Nefereti. This city, with its beautiful temple and palace, was a
                        species of Egyptian Versailles. One painting in the museum represents the
                        queen with her children on her knee,and is a perfect gem of realistic art.
                        There is a fine collection of painted wine vases, many of which are dated as
                        to the time the wine was received. Of great importance is the pottery of
                        foreign origin, which is now known to be of Mycenaean origin from Crete, and
                        resembling that found by Dr. Evans at Kaossos-which is class proof at a
                        close commercial intercourse between the zean and the Nile Valley. The
                        papyri, which have been published by Mr. Percy Newberry, are of great
                        impartanoe, beside several portions of the Book of the Dead,</p>

                        certain persons for entering into conspiracy with the women of the royel
                        harem. An interesting feature of this document is the charge against the
                        aconsed of having employed witchcraft by using wax statues to win over the
                        women to their cause. Also remarkable is the order given to the chief
                        conspirator to commit suicide, a form of death which, according to the
                        Egyptian religion, entailed eternal death both in this world and the
                        next,</p>
                    <p>Next of importance is the report of the Royal Commission which was appointed
                        in the reign of Rameses XX, about B.c 1000, to examine all the royal tombs,
                        and to report upon their condition, as many of them had been broken into and
                        robbed. The report is followed by the trial of a regular band of robbers,
                        embracing all classes of the Theban population-from priests to
                        washerwomen.</p>
                    <p>There are also some fine Greek papyri, which have been discovered by Drs.
                        Hunt and Grenfell, and among them is a portion of the Septuagint version of
                        Genesis, which is certainly the oldest manuscript of the Bible known. There
                        are several very early fragments of Gospels and St. Paul's Epistler, and a
                        curious Apocalyptio work entitled the "Apocalypse of Issiah." There are many
                        Coptic manuscripts, some of them of great value for the study of Church
                        History,</p>
                    <p>It is the wish of all lovers of archaeology that this collection will not
                        have to be dispersed, for Lord Amherst, who is a keen arobeologist, has
                        always placed his treasures open to all Orientalists, both English and
                        foreign. Lady Amherst has written a most useful history of Egypt, and her
                        daughter, Lady William Cecil, has conducted some good excavations in the
                        tombs at Assonan and published excellent descriptions of their contents.</p>

                        Harrison played a good but lacky inninga for the Janiors, and Henley in the
