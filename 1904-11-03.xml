                        <p>From 8 a.m. up to noon of yesterday the weather remained boisterous, very
                            squally, with frequent heavy showers from the N.W. and a rough sea. It
                            gradually abated and gave place to a light breeze and smoother sea,
                            which continued throughout the night. Barometer still keeping
                            steady.</p>
                        <p>At 7a.m. to-day a heavy shower passed over Abdul Abbas district, but none
                            over the Kom-el-Nadoura Observatory.</p>

                    <p>According to a telegram from London to day, the negotiations between Great
                        Britain and Russia in regard to what has been described by Lord Rosebery as
                        the "unspeakable outrage" of the Russian Baltic Fleet, are progressing. The
                        commission which is to study the matter will probably consist of an admital
                        and a legal adviser on both sides, together with naval officers belonging to
                        neutrals. Great Britain is in favour of Paris, and Russia of The Hague, as
                        the place for the meeting. Other essential points require the most careful
                        consideration. Meanwhile, we are told, the Russian fleet will probably be

                        Government to believe that every guarantee has been received that the fleet
                        will no longer constitute a menace to our shipping. We are content to await
                        the results of the enquiry with calm and dignified patience. The attitude of
                        England has, indeed, throughout been characterised with admirable calmness.
                        The outrage touched us vitally. The offence was not only one against the
                        lives of English. men, it was an outrage committed on the high seas against
                        the nation which claims to rule the waves. Nothing could so stir the country
                        as an atrocity which touches a maritime people in so sensitive a spot, and
                        nothing could seem more dastardly to English ideas than a cowardly attack,
                        whether deliberate or unpremeditated, upon unarmed and defenceless men. Had
                        the fishermen been French, or of any other nationality, our indignation
                        would scarcely have been less, though our personal honour would not have
                        been involved. The measure of our anger's depth, and the measure of our de-1
                        termination, may be taken by the calmness we continue to display. It is a
                        dangerous calm, symptomatic of feelings that are too deep and sacred for
                        words or demonstration. It is earnestly to be hoped that it is properly
                        understood abroad, and especially at St. Petersburg. For any misapprehension
                        which confuses patience with pusillanimity, or moderation with readiness to
                        allow this outrage to be passed over as other outrages, almost as
                        "unspeakable," have been, will as surely lead to disaster as that obstirate
                        defiance by Russia of which perturbing signals have not been lacking. There.
                        is no shred of division or irresolution in Great and Greater Britain. Never
                        before has the country been so absolutely one. If quarrel we must have we
                        have that quarrel just, and once in we will so bear ourselves that others
                        may beware of us. Our conscience acquits us of bellicose or Chauvinistic
                        impatience. We have borne ourselves like men in our treatment of an
                        unparalleled situation. We still earnestly hope that our moderation and
                        dignity will be rewarded as they deserve. But if it fall out otherwise, we
                        shall bear ourselves like men to the bitter end, strong in the justice of
                        our cause</p>

                    <head>THE WAR.</head>
                    <p>The only war news we have to-day is contained in a telegram from Tokio
                        reporting a tremendous bombardment of Port Arthur, the fall of which is said
                        to be near at hand. Meantime, all is quiet in Manchuria, though we may hear
                        at any time that the Japanese have resumed the offensive. The annals of
                        scientific warfare would be vainly searched for any tactical position re-
                        sembling that of the two vast armies now facing one another between
                        Liao-yang and Mukden. For fully two weeks, each of these immense forces has
                        virtually stood at bay, challenging the other to come on. Pretty equally
                        matched in numbers and pugnacity, they only wait for an order to rush at the
                        foe, and obedience will be rendered with all possible alacrity. But Marshal
                        Oyama and General Kuropatkin are concerned with matters of higher moment
                        from their respective standpoints. It was the Russian late effort to march
                        south, to relieve Port Arthur, which influenced the Japanese commander to
                        replace offensive strategy by defensive. Similarly, it was the Japanese
                        impetuous northerly advance that constrained Kuropatkin, after the failure
                        of his attempt to get south, to halt on the Sha-ho. In the one case, the
                        object is the capture of Port Arthur by starvation and storm combined before
                        relief arrives; in the other, the Russians feel them- selves bound to retain
                        possession of Mukden. at any cost. In effect, it is a game of patience, and
                        it only remains to be seen which side will be the first to give way to
                        irritation at the delay. </p>

                    <p>Coquelin Ainé makes his debut at the Zizinia Theatre to-morrow evening in
                        Molière's comedy Tartufe, in which he will play the title role.</p>
                    <p>It will be interesting if we give a few particulars of the great French
                        actor's life. Coquelin Ainé is the son of a baker, and was destined
                        originally to follow that trade; but evincing a great aptitude for the
                        stage, he went to Paris and was admitted to the Conservatoire on December
                        29, 1859, joining M. Regnier's class, of which he became the most brilliant
                        pupil. He obtained the second prize for comedy, and made his debut at the
                        Théâtre Français on December 7, 1860, in the character of Gros-René in the
                        "Dépit Amoureux." He afterwards played with success in the "Fourberies de
                        Scapin," "Mariage de Figaro," "Don Juan," and other classical pieces; Lupin
                        in "La Mère Confideute; the Marquis in "Le Joueur;" Annibal in
                        "L'Aventurière," &amp;c. He created the role of Anatole in "Une Loge
                        d'Opera," John in Trop Curieux," Gagneux in "Jean Baudry," Vincent in
                        "L'Eillet Blanc," Aristide in "Le Lion Amoureux," Gringoire in the play of
                        that name, Beaubourg in "Paul Forestier," Eucrate in "Le Coq de Mycille,"
                        &amp;c. M. Coquelin has obtained great success in society by reciting in
                        private and at public meetings, and has thus added to the reputation of new
                        poets, particularly of Eugène Ma nuel and François Coppée. In 1886 he was
                        put on the list of "societaires pensionnaires" of the Theatre Français, and
                        this prevented him from appearing as an actor in any French theatre. But,
                        after travelling abroad in America and Alsace at the head of a dramatic
                        company of his own formation, he reentered the Comedie Française in
                        December, 1889, and played Mascarille, Diafoirus, and Argente, and other
                        parts, in order to support his son Jean, at that time making his first
                        appearances as an actor. He created the part of Labussière in M. Sardou's
                        Thermidor, which after three representations was interdicted by the French
                        Government (January 25, 1891). His next creation was Petruccio in a modified
                        version of the "Taming of the Shrew" (Nov. 1892). As his engagement at the
                        Theatre Français lasts only six months each year, he has recently taken to
                        touring abroad with a company of his own selection, and in the summer of
                        1892 he brought "Thermi dor" and "La Megère Apprivoisée" to London. He is
                        the author of several works on the comedian's art.</p>

                    <head>THE KOM OMBO CO.<lb/>A GREAT UNDERTAKING.</head>
                    <p>We have been favoured with some interesting details regarding the progress
                        being made by the Kom Ombo Company, which is engaged 1 in undertaking the
                        development of the great plain extending from the Nile to Gebel Silsileh The
                        undertaking is financed by Sir Ernest Cassel and Messrs. Suares and Cattaui.
                        The t concession extends to 120,000 feddans, with the option of taking up
                        another 40,000 feddans at a slightly higher level, which is now about to be
                        surveyed.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent, writing on the subject,</p>
                    <p>The work which is now being done at Kom Ombo is one of the most important
                        undertakings which has ever been attempted in this country. The Suez Canal
                        and the Assouan Dam may take precedence of it, but, for my part, I have no
                        objection to stating that the work now being taken in hand at Kom Ombo is
                        fully entitled to take the third place. Nobody, who has not visited and
                        personally inspected the works, can have the slightest conception of their
                        magnitude and of the enormous task, which has been undertaken in order to
                        make this huge desert plain at smiling area of cultivated land. It is a
                        great pity that the disaster of last year, when the pamping building tumbled
                        down, should have greatly impeded the work. At present the pumping
                        installation is being rapidly developed. The levelling of the land, the
                        making of canals, the laying of the piping, and the many other odd jobs,
                        necessitated by such a gigantic undertaking, are being rapidly brought to
                        completion to enable crops to be grown at an early date. No less than four
                        thousand men are now engaged on the work. One of the most remarkable
                        portions of the work is the pumping installation. Vast shops have been
                        erected for the pumps and all the other kinds of mechanical works. Birch Bey
                        is the great organiser and manager of this property. From the conversation
                        which I had with him, he appeared to be quite satisfied with the progress
                        that is being made and he stated that he had no doubt but that Sir Ernest
                        Cassel would be equally satisfied.</p>

                    <head>MENZALEH CANAL &amp; NAVIGATION CO.</head>
                    <p>The powerful new dredger for the Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company has
                        now been built, and it is expected that it will be at work in about a week's
                        time. The order for the fleet of this company has been placed in the hands
                        of the Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel Company, who are charged with
                        the whole of the order. The fleet will consist of six barges, two passenger
                        steamers, and two tugs, and all these vessels will be built in England. They
                        will be delivered by June 1, 1905. By that date it is hoped to open a
                        portion of the canal (30 kilomètres) between Matarich and Port Said. This
                        will be a great advantage for passengers. The Belgian company which has a
                        light railway in this part of the Delta will run a service of specially
                        quick trains from Mansourah to Matarieh in connection with the boats of the
                        Menzaleh Company. The time occupied on the journey from Matarieh to Port
                        Said will thus be shortened to five hours. The immense possibilities for the
                        development of the Sharkieh Province owing to this rapid communication are
                        obvious. </p>

                    <p>New Harbour Works</p>
                    <p>At the end of last year the Suez Canal Company invited tenders for making two
                        new basins on the Asiatic side of Port Said harbour, one of which was to
                        accommodate the colliers that discharge there and the other the petroleum
                        tank steamers. </p>
                    <p>Among the numerous tenders received from all parts of Europe, that sent in by
                        the Société de Grands Travaux de Marseille was accepted. Including the
                        additional or supplementary works that the Canal Company will carry out
                        itself, the total cost of constructing these two new basins will amount to
                        about three million frames, or £120,000. Once these basins are completed,
                        that now known as the "Bassin Abbas," near the waterworks, on the African
                        side, will be utilized for steamers generally, other than the colliers which
                        at present use it exclusively. </p>
                    <p>The Suez Canal Company intends likewise to considerably improve the two other
                        basins, known by the names of the Bassin de l'Arsenal and the Bassin Chérif,
                        on the same side of the shore, by enlarging and deepening them and adapting
                        or making them available also for cargosteamers of the largest tonnage and
                        draught. As a result of these improvements and changes the general workshops
                        will have to be removed elsewhere. They will, at the same time, be much
                        enlarged, remodelled, and improved. After a long study of this question the
                        chief engineer of the company, now in Paris, recommended that the new
                        buildings should be erected on the Asiatic side of the harbour, opposite the
                        town, where sufficient space is available, and at this moment a definite
                        project is before the directors for their approval.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, a short time back the Canal Company imported three large
                        porteurs, floating receivers or mud tanks, which are used, in connection
                        with the powerful marine dredgers in the port. To increase the dredging
                        operations necessary to keep the port at a uniform and requisite depth, the
                        company has ordered another steamer dredger and mud tank combined, of the
                        type known as the Puissante Of the new floating dock recently arrived at
                        Port Said from England we have already given a description. </p>

                    <p>About 10.30 p.m., whilst the performance was going on, the ticket-collector
                        was seen to rush into the auditorium closely pursued by the man in charge of
                        the box-office, of Greek nationality, who carried a dagger in his hand. The
                        latter fell upon his victim and inflicted a deep wound in the back, from
                        which the man fell in front of the stage. He attempted to rise and escape,
                        but was furiously attacked twice and fell dying at the side entrance of the
                        theatre, leaving a trail of blood behind him. The audience, panic-striken,
                        rushed to the exits of the theatre, and it was left to the fireman on duty
                        to effect the capture of the murderer. The latter seized his belt axe and
                        felled the man to the ground near his dying victim. The murderer, however,
                        escaped the clutches of the fireman and was finally arrested as he emerged

                    <p>The motive of the crime has not as yet transpired, but it evidently arose
                        from a violent quarrel which the two men had at the entrance of the

                    <head>DEATH OF ARABIC SCHOLAR.</head>
                    <p>The Morning Post of last Friday says: We regret to announce that Professor H.
                        Anthony Salmoné, Professor of Arabic at King's College, London, died at his
                        residence, 47, Powis-square, from apoplexy. Of Cretan parentage, he was born
                        in Beyrout in 1860 and educated in the university of that city. Soon after
                        coming to this country he was appointed professor of Arabic at University
                        College, Lon don, and in 1890 he received the appointment of professor at
                        King's College. In the same year he published an important Arabic-English
                        and English-Arabic Lexicon in two volumes and received a gratifying
                        acknowledgment of his work from the Sultan, who sent him the Order of the
                        Modji-lich of the Third Class in re- cognition of the services he had
                        rendered to Oriental literature. For many years Professor Salmoné, by his
                        addresses and writings, laboured to draw attention to the necessity of
                        encouraging Oriental studies in Great Britain, and he contributed
                        miscellaneous articles to the reviews and newspapers, including the Morning
                        Post. He published in 1896 a book on "The Fall and Resurrection of Turkey,"
                        and devised and edited "The Imperial Souvenir," an in- teresting work which
                        was dedicated by special permission to Queen Victoria. It gives a metrical
                        translation of the third verse of the National Anthem in fifty languages
                        spoken in the British Empire.</p>

                    <p>Since the 3rd October traffic has been stopped on that portion of the Attaba
                        el Khadra leading from the entrance to the Mohamed Aly-street to the
                        beginning of the Mousky. The shopkeepers have suffered very greatly from
                        this interruption to the traffic. It was officially estimated that the
                        barricade would only last for three days, but it continued from the 3rd
                        October until Monday last, when the work was practically finished. The
                        labourers did their best to prolong the job, and the interests of the

                    <head>THE EVE OF THE SEASON.<lb/>A HINT TO TRAVELLERS. </head>
                    <p>We are on the eve of the season, and all the steamers going East are
                        depositing passengers booked for Egypt and the Nile. Some of these are
                        visiting this country for the first time, others are old habitués, among
                        whom are several who are coming to visit the country again after the lapse
                        of many years. The following information will doubtless be of service to
                        many of these. </p>
                    <p>Society people who come for social pleasures, and who soon tire of Egyptology
                        and sight- seeing, will find one of the new hotels, luxuriously built and
                        equipped to meet all modern requirements (such as the Savoy, Ghezireh
                        Palace, the Continental, or Shepheard's) will afford them a comfortable
                        resting place. But there is another section of the community to be reckoned
                        with and provided for. It is composed of people who are travellers in the
                        true sense; whose object in visiting Cairo is to see all the objects of
                        antique interest-not at a breakneck pace and because they must "get
                        through,"-but in their own way, and who con- template during the winter a
                        long series of lei- surely and reverent ruminations amid the actual scenes
                        made familiar to them in the course of laborious study. Such persons would
                        find the fashionable life and circumstances of the large hotels distinctly
                        distasteful, not to say jarring. But the scientific traveller and studious
                        person is not uncatered for; the Hotel du Nil has always been his
                        headquarters and remains his proper "locale".</p>
                    <p>It may very probably be news to many who have thought they knew Cairo, that
                        the Hotel du Nil stands 3 metres higher than the Esbekich and the hotels in
                        that quarter. The house is an irregular square in Moorish architecture. Its
                        picturesque character may be taken for granted when it is said that the
                        bedrooms, of which there are 100, open on to verandahs on the ground floor,
                        and on the first floor on to a charming balcony which rans round two of the
                        inner sides of the courtyard. The aspect of the hotel is full South, and its
                        position is sheltered. Moreover, the building has none of the heavy
                        character which is given by much marble, even when it is white in colour. </p>
                    <p>One has greater warmth, therefore, during the winter at the Hotel du Nil than
                        when located elsewhere in Cairo. One terrace only is marble-paved, and on
                        this the person who wishes a quiet sun-bath may sit and study removed from
                        all the sounds of the town, while) in the middle of it, and commanding a
                        six-acre extent of open ground, is the garden of the Grand Moofty. The
                        observatory tower on the highest terrace commands a most magnificent view.
                        The hole of the city to its farthest circumference (for the Hotel du Nil
                        occupies its mathematical centre) is spread around on all sides. The slender
                        minaret of the Mosque Adi Yehish is the beautiful object close at hand that
                        one notices against the blue sky, in this air, which is certainly as fresh
                        as any in Cairo. The Mohamed Aly Mosquestands out well on the city's edge
                        with the Mokattam Hills in the rear, and the Pyramids of Ghizeh and even of
                        Sakarah are comprehended also in the wonderful view. The entrance is on the
                        Khalig, a new, broad roadway opening out from the Mousky; the dining room
                        has windows on three sides, there are two coffee-rooms, and three pleasant
                        salons where refuge and coolness from the midday sunshine and glare of the
                        terrace is acceptable. Breakfast and tea, and in fact any meal at the
                        pleasure of visitors, may be taken in the kiosks in the courtyard, where
                        bananas, date palms, and a banyan afford a green repose for the eyes. The
                        hotel has a dark-room for photographers, a billiard room and bar, bath
                        rooms, and an additional room which is fitted with a very complete douche
                        apparatus. The manage- ment and cooking at the Hotel du Nil are excellent,
                        and the major domo is one of the best-known and most respected men in Cairo,
                        always most successful in making his guests happy and comfortable.</p>
                    <p>In the early days of the Hotel du Nil, Cairo had no Ismailia, no Tewfikieh,
                        no Doabara quarters. It was Mousky, Mousky, and always Mousky, and for the
                        whole of one's sojourn in Cairo then, as now at the. Nil, whether in the
                        house or out of it, one felt one's self to be really in the East. A
                        foreigner who was com paring his impressions of some European cities the
                        other day was heard to say, "London it is grand, Paris it is magnifique, but
                        Gothenburg- I like it In the same way the verdict of many old habitués of
                        Egypt who come again and again to stay in Cairo is-Shepheard's it is grand,
                        the Savoy it is magnificent, but the Hotel du Nil-I like it.</p>

                    <byline>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</byline>
                    <dateline>London, October 28</dateline>
                    <p>As we anticipated in our issue of last week, there has been a sharp rally in
                        Agricultural Bank shares, which have risen to 10 1/2. There has been large
                        buying during the last few days which came from a well-informed source, and
                        the supply of shares on the Market here is limited. National Bank shares
                        have reacted a little after touching 23 1/4, but are still a remarkably firm
                        market at 22 1/2, the new shares standing at 6 1/4 premium. A feature
                        yesterday was a rise of 1/2 in Delta Preferred to 15 1/2. In spite of the
                        tension caused by the political situation of the last few days, the market
                        in Egyptian Stocks has held firm, in fact more than that, prices have
                        advanced, which cannot be said of any other section of the Stock Markets. It
                        is a marked sign of the strength of the market for Egyptian securities that
                        it should be able to cut itself adrift from such a general and strong
                        depression as affected all other securities yesterday. Buyers always take up
                        and pay for their purchases, consequently there is no weak Bull element –
                        such as in the highly speculative markets who easily take fright, in a
                        crisis such as we are passing through just now, and are accustomed to sell
                        as eagerly as they before bought. At the closing of the mail, I learn on
                        high authority that before many hours are over the Russian trouble will be
                        settled to our satisfaction; due in no small measure to the fact that all
                        the financial concerns in Paris are up to their necks in Russian securities.
                        Very important news has also just reached Russia from Port Arthur, which may
                        have a serious bearing on their attitude towards England at the present
                        moment. </p>

                    <p>American Futures. The market this week has been generally dull in tone,
                        although there have been frequent fluctuations, and prices have had a
                        declining tendency. Today's closing values are 5 @ 8 points lower than those
                        of last Thursday. Crop movements continue large, and there is a disposition
                        to somewhat increase the estimates of yield, 11 millions being probably the
                        most generally accepted figure, although estimates as high as 12 millions
                        are by no means uncommon. For the moment, at any rate, there seems to be too
                        much cotton moving to make any decided upward movement in prices likely.
                        There have been the usual reports of killing frosts from several sections of
                        the cotton area, but they have failed to arouse more than momentary
                        interest. During the last day or two, political anxiety has overshadowed the
                        market, and at the moment of writing is still the predominating influence.

                    <head>MR. DUPUIS' REPORT.<lb/>THE GASH SCHEME</head>
                    <byline>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector General of Irrigation in
                        Lower Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</byline>
                    <p>As we have now concluded the case for the Blue Nile, we pass on to the
                        consideration of Mr. Dupuis’ proposals relating to the river Gash.</p>
                    <p>The river Gash project consists of a scheme for storing and controlling the
                        water of that river, and using it in the irrigation of the country about
                        Kassala. This river is peculiar in that it finally disappears in the
                        sands.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dupuis' report describes the river Gash as issuing from the Abyssinian
                        hills on to the Sudan plains in the form of a wide, shallow, sandy torrent
                        on much the same level as the plains themselves. As far as Kassala the river
                        is confined to its channel, but below) Kassala it begins to spill over its
                        banks, the spills becoming more numerous and continuous, with several fairly
                        large and defined channels amongst them, with the result that 6 or 7 miles
                        from Kassals the river channel has dwindled away to nothing. The spill
                        leaves a thick mud deposit, on which large areas of durra are cultivated.
                        The water flows forward from 50 to 100 miles in more or less ill-defined
                        channels, irrigating large areas of grazing ground and 6 patches of
                        cultivation. These channels tend to unite and grow deeper again, becoming
                        fewer in number, until one only is left, which eventually loses itself in a
                        sandy desert tract to the north of the village of Fillik.</p>
                    <p>The Gash flows for only about eighty days in the year, coming down early in
                        July and drying up in the latter part of September. Throughout the remainder
                        of the year the river bed is absolutely dry. Mr. Dupuis is of the opinion
                        that the ordinary flood discharge of the Gash does not often exceed
                        5,000,000 cubic meters a day. At the Kassala ford the channel t is 250 m.
                        wide, and the flood depth about 50 cm.</p>
                    <p>The Gash is given to troublesome vagaries, in consequence of which the
                        cultivated areas and grazing grounds shift about and the t wells are
                        affected, involving migrations of the population and a feeling of
                        insecurity, with other disadvantages.</p>
                    <p>To remedy this and introduce stable conditions, Mr. Dupuis recommends the
                        following scheme-</p>
                    <p>"If works can be constructed on any scale, it would seem that what is
                        required is a large circular basin enclosing the tract about the delta head,
                        into which the river would be guided by small retaining banks running some
                        little distance up the main river on either side. The river would be
                        received into this basin and allowed to overflow and spread about in the
                        area enclosed, throwing down the greater portion of its heavy silt just as
                        it does at present, and passing off through several regulators in the
                        surrounding bank. Until the end of the flood the regulators in this bank
                        would not be used to a greater extent than was necessary to secure the
                        partition of the water in the way desired, so that existing conditions would
                        be but very slightly disturbed. At the end of the flood, when the river
                        began to fall, the regulators would be closed and the whole basin give a
                        last thorough soaking, and the stored water could then be run off and
                        utilised lower down. The various regulators would form the heads of
                        different canals, or might feed a second system of basins forming a more or
                        less concentric ring round the first circular basin, or one or more of them
                        might be used merely as escapes to pass away excess of water forward down
                        the existing lines of flow.”</p>
                    <p>The idea requires developing after more information has been collected. The
                        advantage of the scheme is that it can be carried out progressively and
                        tentatively so as to profit by actual experience.</p>
                    <p>There is much to recommend something being done in this direction, for, as
                        Mr. Dupuis reports, the agricultural possibilities of the Gash area in
                        Kassala Moudirieh cannot fail to strike any visitor interested in such
                        matters; the fertility of the soil is unquestionable, and there is no doubt
                        as to the former prosperity of the country. Nothing, he writes, could give a
                        greater impetus to the restoration of the district than works for the
                        control of the Gash flood, by means of which definite conditions could be
                        guaranteed to definite tracts of country. Lord Cromer, in his covering
                        dispatch, places the Gash project first in order of importance of the
                        irrigation works intended to benefit the Sudan, though Sir W. Garstin places
                        it after the Wad Medani barrage and Gheritel canals. For the Gash project
                        Sir William estimates the cost at LE: 500,000, and the revenue from land tax

                    <head>THE STATE OF HELOUAN<lb/>THE WATER SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>In a preceding article we voiced the complaints of the people of Helouan on
                        the subject of the deplorable state of their roads and of the complete
                        indifference displayed by the Tanzim Department towards their grievances.
                        But the complaints of the inhabitants of Helouan against the Tanzim
                        Department are just as loud owing to the water supply. The water of Helonas
                        is taken from the Nile and pumped into a reservoir. But owing to the
                        development of Helouan towards the East, that part of the town, being at a
                        higher altitude, can get very little water, and sometimes none during the
                        day, because of the low pressure. Some- times the inhabitants of East
                        Helouan have to wait until nightfall in order to fill their cisterns for the
                        next day's supply. On many days throughout the year the water fails entirely
                        in this part of Helouan. The quantity of the water is insufficient because
                        the reservoir is too low or else there is a defect in the arrange- ment of
                        the pipes. The reservoir and the water supply are in the hands of the Tanzim
                        Department. Several complaints have been made to the officials of that
                        Department on the subject of the pressure question, but no notice is
                        taken.</p>
                    <p>If the quantity of the water affords grounds for complaint, the quality is an
                        even greater grievance. The colour of the water is that of thick, yellowish,
                        liquid mud. It is impossible to take a bath, as the water is not merely of a
                        most repulsive colour, but quite filthy. The water is served out in the same
                        state as it arrives from the river. There is no attempt at filtration
                        whatsoever. Since the last cholera outbreak the Government has given grants
                        to many centres of population throughout Egypt for the purpose of improving
                        the water supply. At Helouan an attempt at boring for wells was made, but no
                        good water was found. This was the only attempt made, and since the failure
                        of the boring the Government has done nothing to improve the water supply.
                        Yet Helouan is the only watering place in Egypt and every year attracts more
                        and more visitors from every part of the world. Thousands and thousands of
                        pounds have been sunk in hotels, sanatoria, baths, pensions, palaces and
                        villas, and the population of the town is rapidly increasing. What makes the
                        matter worse is that taxes have been introduced into Helouan within the last
                        two years, and the Government thereby draws L.E. 3,000 from the town. But
                        since the taxes have been levied, no improve- ment in the administration of
                        the town has been made and even such elementary necessities as roads and
                        water are neglected.</p>

                    <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</head>
                    <p>Sir, I am sure the public of Helouan are deeply grateful to you for having
                        set forth their complaints on the subject of the disgraceful state of our
                        roads in to-day's issue. I myself have personally interviewed the officials
                        of the Tanzim Department on the question of the defective supply of water
                        and of the state of the Nile road, but no notice has been taken of my
                        complaints except to say that no money was available. The local Commission
                        says the same and does nothing. Recently I sent two registered letters to
                        the president of the local Commission asking that gentleman to give orders
                        for a few lights to be effected on the road leading to our establishment.
                        Neither of these letters received any attention, and the president did not
                        even send a reply. This is a sample of the indifference which prevails among
                        the members of the local Commission. The town ought not to be neglected as
                        it is, for our roads and our water are both in a shameful state and it is
                        essential that some steps should be taken to induce the Tanzim Department to
                        improve the existing state of things.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH TRADE IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>One of the most detrimental factors operating against the development of
                        British trade in Egypt is the employment of foreign agents by English
                        manufacturers to introduce their goods on the market. Some instructive
                        examples of the state of things now prevailing have of late been brought to
                        our notice. For instance, an agent at Cairo of a well-known Nottingham firm
                        for a certain article in common use, is also an agent for a manufacturer of
                        the same article on the Continent, who is one of his compatriots. In pushing
                        the goods of the latter he invariably submits the samples of the former firm
                        and points out how much cheaper the Continental manufacturer can produce an
                        equivalent article. The unfairness of this system is obvious, for many of
                        the English manufacturers are in many cases only known. to the local
                        retailers through home introductions and representatives. Why should not
                        English manufacturers endeavour to obtain British subjects resident in
                        Egypt, who would take their interests far more to heart than do the existing
                        foreign representatives, who have always their own axe to grind.</p>

                    <p>Pending the outcome of the present crisis with Russia the departure of naval
                        reliefs for the Mediterranean Fleet, the East Indies Squadron, and the China
                        Squadron have been cancelled.</p>
                    <p>It has been decided that the headquarters and service squadrons of the 20th
                        Hussars will be stationed at Brighton on its return from Cairo, and the
                        reserve squadron at Canterbury.</p>
                    <p>The formal retirement of Lieutenant-Colonel W. II. Drage, D.8.0., Army

                        Army, has just taken place. He leaves the service with the best wishes of
                        all who know him.</p>

                        having accepted a staff billet in India. The step should go to Major
                        Fitzgerald Wintour, who was transferred a year ago as second in command of
                        the 1st Battalion - now at Colchester - from the 2nd Royal West Kents in
                        Ceylon. He has four campaigns to his credit-Egyptian war 1882, Nile ex-.

                        regiment if the recruits can be obtained, it is announced. If correct, it is
                        rather curious that the Army Council with Mr. Arnold Forster's wild-cat
                        scheme in view is adding to one end of the army whilst proposing to cut off
                        several battalions at the other.</p>

                        when finished the manu- facture of the ammunition has been begun. At
                        Woolwich 20,000 181-lb shells are to be made, and a similar order for the 12

                        are to be re-armed, has also been put in hand.</p>
                    <p>It has been officially announced that no reduction is to be made in the
                        strength of the various British squadrons scattered over the globe. This
                        statement is reassuring and it is needed at the present crisis.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir, – My Bombay servant arrived at Suez on October 12 last by the
                            Austrian Lloyd S.S. Imperator. His luggage was properly fumigated by the
                            Government authorities, and he was discharged after signing the usual
                            formal declaration as to his destination and definite address. He
                            arrived at Alexandria promptly, and has been in my house constantly
                            since. </p>
                        <p>On the 30th of October, eighteen days after his arrival, a representative
                            of the Sanitary Department called to inquire concerning him, and I was
                            told he might wish to see him later. On November 1, the same gentleman
                            came to my house at the breakfast hour, and took my servant to Bacos
                            station for examination for plague, twenty days after he was discharged
                            from the ship.</p>
                        <p>There he was told to come for six days at the same hour for further
                            examination. On my formal protest at such a ridiculous procedure, the
                            resident doctor, who cannot be blamed for carrying out his orders,
                            kindly agreed to visit my house for these six days.</p>
                        <p>Possibly some of your readers can explain who is responsible for this
                            useless formality at this late date.</p>

                        <p>Sir,-In your remarks in yesterday's issue. regarding the present
                            omnibuses, which areallowed to crawl about the streets of Cairo, you
                            might have stated that it is probably on account of the "influential
                            capitalists'' who compose the company that the 'buses are permitted to
                            obstruct the traffic at their own sweet will. I lately remarked to a
                            "shawish" on duty how extraordinary it seemed that he exercised control
                            over all the remainder of the traffic while he permitted the buses to
                            loiter about (near the Ateb-el-Khadra) often two and three abreast, as
                            they wished. He instantly named two of the most influential officials in
                            the country as partners in the bus company, and that consequently it
                            would not pay a police- man to interfere. This impression, which has
                            been successfully created among the City Police force, explains a good
                            deal. Any persons who would care to see for themselves have only to
                            drive (or, better, walk) down to the Ateb-el-Khadra-square at any hour
                            of the day</p>

                        late; it did another very unusual thing at Toukh station, stayed there
                        several minutes, and the consequence was it arrived at Tantah 32 minutes
                        late. It will be interesting if any of your numerous readers can inform us
                        why the train started late, why it stopped at Toukh, and lastly, what time
                        the train arrived at Alexandria It had evidently pulled up 15 minutes loss
                        of time passing here. </p>

                    <p>The Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotels Company, is greatly improving the
                        Savoy Hotel at Assousn for the coming season. A fine lift has been erected
                        and will be in working order by the end of this month. We may mention that
                        the advance bookings at this hotel give every evidence of an excellent
                        season at Assonan, and the Anglo-American Nile Steamer Company has a large
                        number of tourists already on its books. </p>

                    <head>SAINT ANDREW'S FOOTBALL CLUB.</head>
                    <p>The committee of the above club is to be complimented on the excellent
                        attendance at the general meeting called for Tuesday evening. Considering
                        the adverse weather conditions, the number present was exceedingly
                        gratifying, and augurs well for the olab's future. The chair was taken by
                        the Bev. H.P. Reid, and in his opening remarks the chairman congratulated
                        the club on the success attained daring initial season, and also referred to
                        the round financial footing on which the new season was being commenced.
                        Reference was made to the siffion sy of obtaining a ground more suitable
                        than the present pitch on Moharram Bey common, but hopes are entertained
                        thas a better playing pitch will be found in the course of the season. In
                        the meantime she team will continue to play on the old ground. We are
                        inclined to think that were a more inviting piece of ground acquired, the
                        popularity of the club would be assured, but with the enthusiasm displayed
                        by the members, the club has shown itself to be an institution well worthy
                        of the support of the community. </p>
                    <p>The business of the evening included the election of offer-bearers for the
                        new season. The Rev. Mr. Reid was unanimously re-elected president, and Mr.
                        J. Davis Bryan vice-president, Mr. W. J. Webb was elected secretary, and Mr.
                        Geo bwee treasurer. The subscription for playing members was fixed at PT. 60
                        and for honorary members a minimum of PT. 25 was decided upon. </p>
                    <p>Immediate steps are being taken for the drawing up of an attractive fixture
                        card, and a Rales Com mite has also boca appointed to draft rules by which
                        the club will be governed, and these rules will be issued only to all
                        members. The team will meet for practice on Muharrem Bay man Eatonlays at
                        350, and it is hoped that there will be a representative gathering of the
                        players and all others interested. </p>
                    <p>The meeting closed with a hearty vote of thanks" to the chairman.</p>

                        place on the 1st December, 1904, we beg to in- form our kind patrons and the
                        public generally that on account of the considerable rise in these Bonds it
                        is impossible to sell them under P.T. 48 each, until further notice.</p>
