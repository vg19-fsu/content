                    <head>EGYPT-OR UTOPIA.</head>
                    <p>While we cordially welcome the interest which is now being taken at home in
                        Egypt and things Egyptian, it must be confessed that there are certain
                        drawbacks to this attitude, especially when it tends to interference in
                        matters which can only be competently dealt with by those who have gained a
                        profound local knowledge of the country and its people. Egypt is far more
                        liable than any other Oriental country to arouse the platonic passions of
                        that class of busybody whose characteristics <cb n="6"/> have been embodied
                        by Mr. Kipling in "Padgett M. P." And as Cairo develops more and more into
                        an Oriental Brighton during the winter months, there, must necessarily be a
                        growing number of estimable persons, who, inspired by only a superficial
                        acquaintance with the conditions of Egyptian life, return to England.
                        determined to air their pet panaceas for the. betterment of the land in
                        Parliament or the Press. However well-intentioned they may be, their efforts
                        must, in many cases, do positive harm by stirring up that considerable
                        section of the population of the British Isles who belong to the genus
                        "crank" to make mis chievous attempts to hamper the work of Anglo-Egyptian
                        Administration. A suggestive sample of these tactics occurred in a recent
                        issue of the "Manchester Guardian," a correspondent of which paper in Vairo
                        ventilated a number of Egyptian grievances, con-- cluding with the following
                        sentence:- "When it is no longer possible to see Arabic children in Cairo
                        raking the rubbish heaps in the streets for their daily food, then it will
                        be time to declare that British officialism in Egypt is imbued with those
                        high aims, the absence of which called from the lips of an English 'bishop
                        the reproach against Cairo as being the grave of the soul."</p>
                    <p>The statements of this gentleman called forth an article from the editor of
                        the "Guar dian," who indulged in these remarks with all the sententiousness
                        befitting the occasion - "Now, that we have shaken off some of the
                        internationaal fetters on our rule, our respon sibility for these things has
                        become more direct and individual. It cannot be too clearly understood that
                        no administrative clockwork has yet been invented that will go for ever. It
                        cannot be wound up once and for all; there must be steady and continuous
                        interest in the mechanism of government if disaster is to be avoided.
                        English people have never, since the fighting stopped, taken a direct
                        interest in Egyptian affairs in that way, and still less in the welfare of
                        the Egyptian. Our correspondent points out some of the dangers of this
                        indiffe rence. When self-government is conceded the danger is reduced to a
                        minimum, and the policy of non-interference becomes political virtue. But we
                        have not provided ourselves with that safeguard. The machinery of government
                        in Egypt is still almost entirely. English, and if anything goes wrong with
                        it England will suffer the consequences."</p>
                    <p>The sentiments conveyed in this passage. are so excellent as to partake of
                        the nature of truisms, but they are entirely vitiated by the underlying
                        fallacy that Egypt can be benefited by interference from England. What can
                        parliamentary or official interference from home do to prevent "Arab
                        children in Cairo raking the rubbish heaps in the streets for their daily
                        bread " If the views of such persons as the correspondeht of our Manchester
                        contemporary gained acceptance, the grumblers would soon find out to their
                        cost that the distant and illinformed King Stork was much worse to deal with
                        than the local King Log, whatever the faults of the latter may be. If such a
                        policy is pursued to its logical conclusion, and the faddists obtain a
                        hearing through their im portunity and the weakness of the houte
                        authorities, the result will be as disastrous: as was "la politique des
                        rattachements" to Algeria, where the powers of the Governor- General were
                        utterly undermined by interference from Paris. As long as Lord Cromer
                        remains this tendency will be counteracted, but it may become a really
                        serious danger to Egypt in the future. Egyptian development should, and
                        must, proceed on the lines of local, by which we mean not only native but
                        resi dent. European, self government, and all attempts to invoke
                        interference from England as a "Deus ex machina" to bring about a Nilotic
                        Utopia must be most strenuously resisted, for it is a mischievous and
                        unstatesmanlike policy, and runs counter to the entire system on which. the
                        substantial fabric of British influence has been everywhere built up.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I send a few of the smaller stones from the desert, which I think
                            you have not seen, and for which I hope I may claim your adiniration.
                            What, sir, would not gott or I give for that touch of hand and truth of
                            eye ! Look at the wonderful skill with I which they have been carved,
                            repeating again</p>
                        <p>and again the same idea, but almost always with the distinctive touch of
                            the individual worker,--just as in the pretty attractive cloth I word of
                            the Kabyle women, the pattern is not copied or mechanically repeated,
                            but each worker follows an instinct of her own. And so it was with this
                            old stone race. With some exceptions, some types ronghly
                            executed-perhaps of the earlier time, for it! was over an immense space
                            of time that they worked, -- and some few that merely repro dnced the
                            conventional pattern, the mass of the stones bear constant witness to
                            the free play of band and imagination. What gifts this desert people bad
                            i One may donbt--and I am not forgetting the story of Greece, which wa-
                            different in its kind if the world has ever yet produced a race with
                            such an artistic sense 1-o widely distributed--perhaps in Japan 'you
                            have had the nearest approach to it. In the artistic fancies of both
                            ruces - the love of the quaint and grotesque-the mixture of human and
                            demon-yet with a certain self-restraint, the half extravagance kept
                            within the limits of sobriety--you feel as if there were common
                            elements--as if the two races had shared some of the same gifts. I
                            should like to send a tow examples to Tokio for our Japanese friends to
                            pass judgment upon.</p>
                        <p>And now, sir, how goes it with my friends, the learned babes 1 Have they
                            mended their little wayward fashions, and grown in wisdom and stature!
                            Or is A.B.C. still the same sal trial, as it was, to their rebel souls 1
                            Do they Ixtill pont and sulk in their eyrtier? Do they still cry "can't,
                            shan't, won't” while the little fists are doubled up in the little eyes
                            and the little</p>
                        <p>feet stawp upon the flxer? Was there ever sich Ja hullabaloo and piece of
                            work in the nursery</p>
                        <p>all about learning A.B.C., which sooner or later must be learned. There
                            is no prissible escape from it. No amount of shan't and won't</p>
                        <p>can help them. Their fate is inexorably I written. And never was there a
                            prettier, pleasanter, more attractive A.B.C. for a babe to learn--an
                            A.B.C. that sh-uld never have cost a tear oz a whimper! And as soon as
                            they once humble the haughty little souls- just a touch wanted of the
                            penitent's redeeming grace--and set themselves with goodwill to the
                            task, what delight they will find in it, what revelations are waiting
                            for them! But I must not take up too much of your space. At</p>
                        <p>Rome, Trieste, Athens, and again at AlexJandria, I found after some
                            little hunting plenty</p>
                        <p>of traces of the same race. The stone was I much less favorable, ant the
                            work consequently much rougher ; but the lealing types were the same.
                            Some day we ought to be able to trace with considerable exnotness the
                            march of this great people--for really great they | were. You cannot
                            live amongst their work, and with hold your admiration from them.I am,

                        his H.R.H., performing the various evolutions, the Rifle Brigade being

                        the mark, and H.R.H. was pleased to express his entire satisfaction with the
                        bearing of the troops and the evolutions effected.</p>
                    <p>I learn that the Duke of Connaught expressed the opinion that trousers for
                        the native troups, shaped Zouave fashion, would perhaps be more suitable for

                    <p>In the after on, the Royal party, accompanied by the whole staff, crossed
                        over on a visit to Omdurman.</p>

                        at which the Royal party were present. Bimbashi Franklin, director of mu-io,
                        was bonored with a few words of thanks from H. R. H. for his services on the

                    <p>A correspondent writes as followa to the "New York Herald” (Paris) :-I feel
                        that the death of so well- known an American as Judge A. M. Keiley deserves
                        a record. In your edition of Saturday, January 28, I found a short
                        paragraph, ovpied from a French paper, stating that a well-dressed man,
                        about sixty years of age, had been knocked down by a delivery van in the
                        place de la Concorde the day before, and had been carried to the hospital,
                        where he died that night. In his pocket was found a card bearing the name
                        and address of Judge Keiley, 49, Dover-street, Piccadilly-nothing more,</p>
                    <p>Jndge Keiley was a man well known at home and abroad. He had at various times
                        Atted several publio offices in his native city, vit., Louisville, Ky, and
                        for many years had represented the United States in the Mixed Courts of
                        Egypt. He lived in Alexandria until his wife died, two or three years ago,
                        when he resigned his position and went to London, to be near a married
                        daughter</p>
                    <p>Judge Keiley was a man of unusual attainments; he knew the classies as he did
                        the alphabet ; not only spoke half a dozen modern languages, but know their
                        literature as well. He know all good things and loved them. He could tell a
                        story better than the next man, let him tell it never so well, and what is
                        more, could appreciate the point of the other fellow's story. He was
                        liberal, broad-minded, tenderhearted, full of sympathy for suffering :
                        genial and warm-hearted. He was a loyal, staunch friend, and I, who only
                        knew him casually, as it were, feel that I shall not soon look upon his like
                        again.</p>

                    <p>* Helouan, February 12. An important meeting of the Municipal Commissioners
                        of Helouan has been held at the Gouvernorat under the presidency of H. E.
                        the Governor of Cairo. There were present the Tanzim delegate, Mr. Cartis,
                        the Sanitary Department delegate, Dr. Dryer, and the four elected
                        representative members of the town, M. Felix Suares, Hussein Bey Youssef,
                        Mahmoud Fehmy Pasha, and Dr. A. J. M.| Bentley. | The question of the
                        condition and wanta of the town of Helouan came before the meeting, After
                        some remarks from M. Suares, Hussein Bey Youssef, and Mahmoud Febmy Pasha,
                        on the unsatisfactory condition of the town and the miserable financial dole
                        voted to the Commission, Dr. Bentley addressed the Council as</p>
                    <p>follows. | Your Excellency, - You may remember that at our last meeting I
                        presented you with &amp; petition from the inhabitants of the town of
                        Helouen aoking that it might be read and considered by th: Council hefore
                        presenting it to the Government for their consideration. This your
                        Excellency did not see fit? to do, and the only course open to the
                        inhabitants was to go with it direct to the chiefs of the Ministries
                        interested, which petition was later on published in several of the
                        newspapers of Bgypt. This petition, I hear on good authority, was not
                        unfavorably received by the heads of tho various departments concerned. The
                        petition, I may call to your mind, dealt with the following points :(i). The
                        railway service ; (ü). The state of the roads and condition of the water
                        supplied for drinking ; (iii). The constitution of the Local Commission ;
                        (iv). The expenditure of the revenue derived from local taxation.--The
                        Railway (i) is now in the possession of the Delta Light Railway Company and
                        they have promised to carry out certain and, we believe, efficient reforms.
                        The matter of the drinking water and the roads (ii) concerns the Tanzim
                        Department. The allocation of the revenue (iv) derived from Helonan is a
                        financial matter and concerns the Ministry of Finance. The carrying out of
                        (ü), which is so urgently required, is</p>
                    <p>large matter, and it is absolutely impossible to deal with it satisfactorily
                        with the small amount of money allowed to this Commission. (iii The
                        constitution of the Commission is essentially an anomaly s elected partly by
                        public vote to carry out reforms, ithasabsolutely no power to accomplish
                        them. If suggestions are made to the Commission and they are not carried
                        out, the publie regard the failure as being due to its not having the power
                        to im prove, it still has to bear the blame. I propose, therefore, that in
                        the best interests of Helouan. and with a due regard to the dignity of this
                        Council, that the Municipal affairs of the town be placed again in the hands
                        of the Goverament, which alone is able to carry out those reforms so
                        necessary for the well-being of the town. This Commission has doubtless done
                        excellent work in its time, the Tanzim officials connected with it have
                        always been willing to do what they could for the improvement of the town,
                        but owing to the rapidly increasing importance of Helouan and its neigh
                        bourhood, and the urgent and large reforma needed, it is time that the
                        present system, with its very limited powers, should be abolished, and that
                        the municipal affairs should be placed in the hands of the Government, which
                        alone has the power to efficiently carry them out I appeal to your sense of
                        duty not to place any obstacle in the way, but rather to sink all
                        differences and personal feelings for the wellbeing of the town of Helovan,
                        and I further beg to suggest that to facilitate matters this Council should
                        delegate three or more of its members to consult with the Government to
                        ascertain ita views on this matter.</p>
                    <p>The president, in replying, stated that he had received official information
                        that the Finance Ministry had refused to sanction any further aid to Helovan
                        or to grant money to allow more water for the roads and trees. The tour
                        elected representative members there upon tendered their resignation in a
                        body, as a protest against the Government decision. * Later on they were,
                        however, induced by the president to withdraw their resignations
                        conditionally on his Excellenoy på mising to bring their protest before the
                        proper authorities. They, however, expressed very decided views to his
                        Excellency on the uselessness of holding | further meetings under existing
                        circum stances.</p>

                        The reason is simple. By its effect upon nutrition, it enables the child to
                        get from his food all the good there is in it. It is therefore an ideal
                        "builder." The little ones all like the Emulsion and take it. with real
                        pleasure. Moreover it is perfectly simple and safe even for the most

                        following communication in favor of abolishing Egyp tian native, Ministers
                        and Under Secretaries of State</p>
                    <p>"Redde Caesari quae sunt Caesaris. Thanks to Great Britain, Egypt has entered
                        an era of prosperity aud wealth without precedent in her history. By the
                        improvement and by the development of the irrigation system tie fertility of
                        the Egyptian soil has been wonderfully increased, and large tracts of land
                        that a few years ago only could not be cultivated are now producing fine
                        crops. The railway system, which twenty years ago cousisted only in what was
                        deemed strictly necessary for the conveyance and the convenience of the
                        wealthier classes, covers now a considerable area, numer ous branch lines
                        have been laid, railway fares have been reduced, so that the transport by
                        rail has bee me easy, rapid, and cheap. With regard to trade, imports and
                        exports have attained a high figure, as shown by the customs revenues, which
                        are increasing from year to year. Companies have been formed for the working
                        of mines in Upper Egypt, other companies are busy with agriculture, others
                        are engaged in land speculations, foreign capital is pouring into the
                        country, business transactions are easy all over the land.</p>
                    <p>By mentioning thus the main and most striking features of the prosperity of
                        Egypt 1 merely intend to show the beneficial effects of the British
                        occupation; but the object of my letter comes hereafter. From the highest
                        official down to the humblest "fellah" every soul in the Nile Valley knows
                        that the Egyptian Government is practically and exclusively exercis ed by
                        the representativeut Great Britain, who is himself represented in each
                        department by a British off cial, and that official is absolutely the sole
                        effective head of the department. It des not require ich phraseology to
                        enhance the advantages and the soundness of this state of things. Suffice it
                        to say that no intelligent, honest, and straightforward Egyptian would ever
                        dream of its change, especially if h remembers the gloomy days of the past.
                        Under these circumstalices, and since the Egyptia affairs are managed in the
                        right way by Briti-li officials as to ensure the welfare of the country and
                        its population, one is at a loss to under: stand the reason for having
                        native Ministers and Under Secretaries of State, wh, of utility whatever,
                        are, as shown in the following list, a yearly burden to the Egyptian Budget

                    <p>The Val de Travers Company has been established at Alexandria for the past
                        three years, and under the able management of Mr. Mr. Miard it has obtained
                        a large number of local contracts. As an instance of the succes of the
                        company we culi the following para graph from a Calcutta contemporary of the
                        10th ulto.:Yesterday afternoon the Viceroy visited the portion of the Strand
                        road.opposite the point where the Val-de-Travers Company are laying their
                        asphalte. The Hon. R. T Greer, Chairman of the Corporation, Mr. W.B. McCabe,
                        Mr. C. A. Giannacopuloy the repre sentative of Messrs. Glastone, Wyllie and
                        Co., and the expert of the Val-de-Travers Com pany, Mr. Collaud, were
                        present. Considering the suitability of asphalte pavement for a city like
                        Calcutta, especially such portions a Barra Bazaar, it is hoped that the
                        Viceroy's interest in the matter is evidence of a move ment in the direction
                        of extending its use."</p>

                    <p>OPENING DAY.</p>
                    <p>At 2.30 p.m. yesterday, H.H. the Khedive augurated the Khedivial Agricultural
                        Society's Stew, which was favored by warm and quietweather, a bright sun and
                        last but not least -a great number of visitors. Besides the Khedive who
                        stayed for some time and took great interest in the numerons exhibits-nearly
                        all the representatives of the Powers, the Governor of Cairo, and several of
                        the Ministers were present, and with them almost all the principal members
                        of the Khedivial Agricultural Society. Among other visitors to the show we
                        noticed Mr. and Mrs. Graham, Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Hunter, the Hon. A. and Mrs.
                        Davey, Sir William and Lady Wille cks, Dainos Pasha, Mr. Allen, Mr. G. B.
                        Alderson, Mr. Sibbald, Milhem Shaoour Bey and Miss Chacour.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition presented a very animated, not to say exciting scene. Messrs.
                        Orenstein and Koppel's locomotive was running on the circular line of light
                        railway laid down in front of the central hall, pulling a number of trucks
                        and arousing the interest of numerous experts -and non-experts. All the
                        machinery erected in the sheds was at work-pumps, grain clean. ers,
                        decorticators, and diggers of every typeand the Cooper digger was showing
                        its paces, turning in a marvellously short circle and runuing at a good
                        speed on the roadway in front or the old sheds. In the central hall were the
                        exhibits of cotton, cereals and poultry, admirably arranged and attractive
                        exhibits. Another interesting feature, which we do not remember to have seen
                        in previous shows, was Boniteau Bey's collection of insect pests and
                        beneficial insects, the latter including one of the chief enemies of the
                        locusts, a large black "Sphex" resembling a huge and hirsute wasp. A case
                        containing locusts of the 1904 swarms in all stages from two hours' age to
                        maturity was very interesting.</p>
                    <p>The exhibits of cotton and cereals were extremely good, the poultry-Beladi
                        for the most part-made a good show, and there were any well-known names
                        among the prizewinners. In our next issue we will publish the lists of the
                        prizes and winners.</p>
                    <p>EXHIBITS REVIEWED.</p>
                    <p>The following is a description of the exhibits of Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp;
                        Son (Egypt) Ltd:- A Tangye's gas engine with suction producer plant, of 23
                        maximum B. H. P. The well-known arrangement of engine and plant combines the
                        following advantages: No steam boiler or gas holder is required, so that
                        there is no liability of explosion. It does not need onstant supervision,
                        but requires to be attended to only for a few minutes every three or four
                        hours. It occupies only a small amount of floor space and requires no
                        foundation. The apparatus may be fixed indoors as there is no more danger
                        from fire than with an ordinary stove. There is no risk of gas escaping, as
                        it is generated by suction and below atmospheric pressure. There is great
                        economy of fuel as cheap anthracite "peas" are used in the generator. It can
                        be re-started, after being shut down for an hour or so, in a few minutes,
                        and, even from a cold condition, from 15 to 20 minutes. Gas is generated
                        only as it is required by the engine. No gas is blown or burnt twaste on
                        light loads. It is smokeless and tree from smell. The fuel used, known as
                        "anthracite peas," can be obtained easily in Alexandria at a very cheap
                        rate. The fuel consumption does not exceed 0.9 lb. per B. H. P. per hour. On
                        six hours' continuous test of Tangye's gas engine developing 22 B. H. P.
                        working in conjunction with a "D" suction producer, the consumption of
                        anthra cite peas was found to be as low as 0.785 per B. H. P. per hour.</p>
                    <p>One Tangye's 10 B.H.P. portable oil engine is bolted on steel girder frame
                        and mounted on four travelling wheels, the two front wheels being carried by
                        a swivelling carriage for convenience in moving about. The engine is fitted
                        with a balanced crank shaft, oil splash guard, pressure pump, and oil
                        reservoir for supplying the lamps, extended cowl for protecting the
                        vaporiser and lamps from the weather, and a water circulating pump. A tank
                        of large capauity for holding the cooling water is carried on the girder
                        frame, and the water is forced through the jacket of the engine cylinder by
                        the circulating pump to a cooling chamber, where it meets a current of cold
                        air and after wards returns to the opposite end of the tank. The carriage is
                        fitted with shafts, it has slipper and chain for use when travelling down
                        hills, and a set of checks for fixing it in position when the engine is at
                        work.</p>
                    <p>One seamless steel launch. Each side is made all of one plate pressed into
                        shape by hydraulic pressure; all the plates are after wards galvanised,
                        which will give them a very long life against the action of the sea water.
                        It is fitted with a 10 B.H.P. petroleum engine. One Cooper patent steam
                        digger No. 5. Thi is an invention for cultivating all kinds of soil by steam
                        power. Briefly described, it consists of a machine which travels over the
                        land at a rate of from one to two miles an hour, forking up and turning over
                        the soil as it travelby means of a series of forks fixed on a rotating crank
                        in the rear of the machine. The depth to which these forks will enter the
                        soil is regulated by two shoes, which slide over the ground and allow the
                        digging ear to rise or sink with the inequalities of the surface. The
                        diggers are the result of experience gained in actual work during many years
                        under greatly varying conditions and in all kinds of lands, from the hardest
                        sun baked soil of South Africa and Egypt to the heaviest clay or lightest
                        sand of England Under all circumstances, they are now justify <cb n="3"/>ing
                        their claim to be the most efficient cultivators ever made. The work done is
                        similar to the best manual digging, the soil being taken up and exposed to
                        the influence of the air, sun, or frost, in a manner which can only be
                        equalled by carefully digging over every inch of land. Where deeprooted
                        weeds abound, the diggers are the only machines which can suscessfully deal
                        with them, pulling them to the surface instead of cutting the roots under
                        ground and leaving them to grow again.</p>
                    <p>A distinctive and important feature of the Cooper digger lies in the fact
                        that the power exerted in driving the forks into the land and turning the
                        soil, is also useful in an equal degree in lifting the weight of the engine
                        from the ground and propelling it forward. In all other methods of
                        mechanical cultivation, this power is absolutely lost, and even tends to
                        impede the engine. This cir cumstance explains the fact that the Cooper
                        Digger will break up lands to any given degree of fiueness with half the
                        consumption of coal and water of any machine on the market.</p>
                    <p>One of the greatest difficulties which have been met with in cultivating the
                        land with a travelling engine is the length of time wasted in turning at the
                        headlands. In some cases the engines have to be disconnected, and hitched on
                        at the other end of the cultivator. Other machines have to back and
                        manoeuvre to get into the return position. The Cooper digger alone can turn
                        in its own length without stopping, the whole operation being completed in
                        thirty seconds.</p>
                    <p>Another exhibit is theCochran patent boiler. This is a vertical boiler, aud
                        in common with all vertical boilers, it possesses these most important
                        advantages: Economy of floor space. It does not require any brickwork
                        setting. Ali that is required is to set it on a hard level surface and it is
                        ready for work. In addition to these advantages, it has also the following:-
                        By its special arrangement of horizontal fine tubes, it has a large heating
                        surface, thereby combining the advantages of the vertical boiler with the
                        economy of the locomotive or multitubular boi er. At the same time it is
                        wholly accessible for cleaning and examining inside, an advantage not
                        usually possessed by other types of multitubular boilers. This is a point of
                        extreme importance when only impure water is obtainable.</p>
                    <p>The Cochran boiler can be kept thoroughly c'ean inside, and consequently its
                        efficiency is always maintained, and repairs seldom if ever necessary.
                        Experience leads to the confident assertion: (a) that it is more economical
                        than any other small boiler made; (b) that it is more durable and reliable
                        than any other boiler; (e) that it is the easiest boiler to set to work, and
                        the most economical to maintain; (d) that it is absolutely safe from
                        explosion; (e) that it is the cheapest and best made boiler in the
                        market.</p>
                    <p>Garrett's Engines. These engines are from the works of the well-known firm of
                        Messrs. Richard Garrett aud Sous, of Leiston, estab lished in 1778, who have
                        through five successive ge erations devoted themselves espe cially to the
                        perfection of their engines, and to the establishment of an almost
                        unequalled plant of labour-saving and other machinery if the highest class.
                        The engines are fitted. with Garrett's patent corrugated fire-boxes. These
                        fire-boxes are very elastic, which mean durable, and have about 22% more
                        heating surface than the flat-topped boxes, and it must be borne in mind
                        that experiments have proved that about half of the total evaporation of a
                        boiler is carried out in the immediate vicinity of the fire box.</p>

                    <p>Kidney disease comes on quietly-may have been in the system for years before
                        the patient suspected the real cause of his trouble.. There may have been
                        headaches, limb aches, neuralgia, sciatica, rheumatism, a nervous, irritable
                        feeling, or a generally weak, tired, feeling, weak heart, swelling of the
                        flesh, puffy eyes, etc.</p>

                        doctored the symptoms, and not the kidneys,</p>
                    <p>Thus the trouble kept growing worse, until disturbances of the water
                        appeared, or there was gravel, or retention of urine, or backache -or some
                        such plain sign of kidney trouble that there could be no doubt.</p>
                    <p>Dean's backache kidney pills should be taken at the first sign of anything
                        wrong. There is no other safe way, because kidney diseases are the most
                        dangerous of all, except consumption. Doan's pills strengthen the kid neys
                        and help them to properly perform that most important of all functions-the
                        filtering of the blood-help them to flush off, and carry away with the
                        surplus water, all these impurities which the blood gathers up in its
                        circuit of the body. In no other way can you be well. Doan's backache kidney

                    <head>MARKET FOR EGYPTIAN COTTON.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Henry J. Monson writes to us from London:-Before again leaving England
                        for Egypt I have been making close enquiries into the business of Egyptian
                        cotton in Manchester as I did last year. It is of the greatest importance to
                        the cotton growers to know that it is very doubtful if the spindles recently
                        put on to American will revert to Egyptian again. The Egyptian market is
                        bad, the demand does not meet the increased production. If spindles are
                        reverted from American to Egyptian, a greater competition will set in than
                        ever before. The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and the Bolton Master
                        Cotton Spinners Association have amalgamated, and will now control over 30
                        million spindles. The future prosperity of Egypt, and the maintenance of the
                        excessive high value put on land, depends on the move this association
                        makes. If the spindles are reverted, the value put on land at this moment
                        will prove to be entirely imaginary. I am of opinion that much of the land
                        that has been put under cotton will revert again to sugar cane culture.
                        Owing to the great development of cotton cultivation in other parts of the
                        world, Egypt must endeavour to keep to the front. It is useless any one
                        talking to spinners on the quality of Egyptian cotton surpassing all others,
                        expecting a ready purchase and a high price, because the answer given will
                        be a disappointment. I have visited the large wholesale houses in Nottingham
                        and London, The position now is, "that our market looks "like failing us,
                        and if not entirely then our "price obtained will be low owing to great
                        "competition."The sooner we agriculturista get together and discuss this
                        matter of endeavouring to enlarge the present market, seek other markets, or
                        create new markets, the better it will be for our future prosperity. An
                        Egyptian cotton growers' association should be formed at once. You, Sir,
                        would be doing a great service to the country if you would select the names
                        for a committee, with Alex andria as the central office.</p>
