                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>

                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                    <head>The Emancipation of Egypt</head>
                    <p>Some interesting correspondence has recently appeared in our colamus on the
                        subject of a recently published work under the above title, and if the
                        author of this volume has rendered no other service to Egypt he has, at all
                        events, set people pondering arew upon a political problem, the importance
                        of which, from more than one point of view, has not abated with tha
                        prolongation of the British Occupation. We certainly do not share-the
                        opinion of those who would scout discussion for fear of arousing or
                        accentaating those feelings of discontent with the present situation, which
                        the population of Egypt are supposed to harbour. On the contrary, we hold
                        that a candid and dispassionate examination from time to time of the status
                        quo can have none other than a salutary effect. Disscusion, when conducted
                        temperately and with a sincere desire on both sides to elucidate the truth,
                        must inevitably conduce to enlightenment and in the end to a better
                        understanding between the disputants. It is therefore of advantage that the
                        Egyptians should be afforded opportunities of stating their alleged
                        grievances, and that those who represent the tutelary Power should have
                        occasion to explain the position which they take up and the policy they
                        pursue. It is no part of our purpose to-day to seek to justify our continued
                        presence in Egypt on the ground that withdrawal would endanger our great
                        Indian possession, nor do we think that the doctrine of j'y suis, j'y reste
                        is one which can recommend itselt to humane and fair minded men. Egypt's
                        happiness and prosperity should obviously be the sole consideration, and it
                        is from this stand-point alone that we have contemplated the existing state
                        of affair, and contrasted it with the probable condition of the country if
                        the author of the "Emancipation" were allowed to have his way.</p>
                    <p>With the fullest desire to give due weight to every argument advanced, and
                        with a keen perception of the dislike that every patriot Egyptian must
                        experience to the foreign yoke, we cannot bring ourselves to believe that
                        the evacuation would be, at all events in the present circumstances, fraught
                        with benefit for the Egyptians themselves. For let us ask ourselves, to what
                        is due their ever-augmenting prosperity? It is not alone attributable to the
                        fertility of the soil, nor to the extensive scheme of irrigation, nor to the
                        opening up of the country by increased facilities of communication, though
                        these, undoubtedly, are largely contributing elements. But the dominant
                        factor in the situation is Egypt's industrial and commercial credit. Credit
                        is the life-blood of commerce and industry, and credit is founded upon
                        security. What is it that ensures the constant flow of foreign capital into
                        the country, which stimulates industry, and fosters commercial enterprise?
                        It is the knowledge that England, the world's most trusted trader and
                        reliable merchant, is at the back of it all, and, in a sense which business
                        men of every nationality are not slow to recognise, England stands guarantee
                        for Egypt's financial stability. What wonder then that Sir Ernest Cassel, no
                        mean authority on matters financial, should have volunteered the opinion
                        that Egyptian Government securities are the soundest investment outside

                    <p>Let those who are the advocates of "emancipation" give us some reason for the
                        faith that is within them. Let them reflect upon what would result from the
                        adoption of their proposals. Would they willingly see credit decline,
                        capital diminish, and foreign enterprise well righ cease, as would,
                        assuredly happen, once the strong protective arm of England were withdrawn ?
                        Is Egypt, unaided, in a position to cope effectively with internal disorder
                        and to resist external attack ? If evacuation pure and simple were decided
                        upon at this very instant or in the immediate future, where are the naval
                        and military forces that could, in case of need, replace those of the
                        tutelary Power? A fleet takes time to build, as America and Germany can bear
                        effective testimony. An army is not reorganised and reinforced in a day, as
                        English War Ministers know to their dismay. Assuming, for the sake of
                        argument, that all this could be accomplished with a stroke of the pen. Have
                        our Egyptian patriots counted the cost? Are they prepared to lay upon the
                        people a burden of taxation beside which that of Germany and Italyto cite
                        only two inetsuces—is a mere bagatelle? Egypt is much too valuable a prize
                        to be left alone in the "scramble for Africa," and unless during the years
                        that would be occupied in placing her naval and military forces in an
                        efficient condition to resist attack the British would obligingly consent to
                        remain, she would be exposed at any time to invasion by one of the Great
                        Powers, which might result simply in a change of masters after perhaps many
                        sanguinary encounters. Judging from the way that some European nations deal
                        with their over-sea possessions, regarding them as mere sources for swelling
                        revenge and utilising them as refugee for incompetent, turbulent, and
                        dishonest officials, Egypt's last state, in the event just contemplated,
                        might be far worse than her first. </p>
                    <p>Our patriots may probably say that neutralization is their goal, and that, by
                        a self-denying ordinance of the Powers conjoined, the danger of invasion
                        would be obviated. Lot as assume such an international treaty to be already
                        in force. But how would that secure them against interneciae - feuds or
                        domestic revolt? If such were to be the case, they might say, one of the
                        Powers should be permitted to intervene. Precisely so. One of the Powers
                        would, undoubtedly, intervene, but not without exacting a quid pro quo which
                        would possibly entail hardship and oppression of which the present
                        generation of Egyptians know only by tradition. Let us make one further and
                        final assumption, namely, that all these gloomy though highly probable
                        forebodings are falsified by events. What then ? Are there to be found
                        amongst the Egyptians men ready to fill the posts of Ministers upon whose
                        integrity and ability the nation can confidently rely ? This is a crucial
                        point and we have been at pains to elucidate it. The present Council is, of
                        course, out of the running, as it is 'too friendly to the English" and does
                        not possess, therefore, the true national aspirations. But we have asked
                        several of our best-informed and most enlightened Egyptian friends to
                        furnish us with lists of those to whom they think might safely be entrusted
                        the destinies of the nation. Opinions are hopelessly at variance, and with
                        the best will in the world, we have failed to reconcile them. What is the
                        lesson to be learned from this experiment? It is that, apart from all the
                        other consiiderations which we have briefly indicated, the Egyptians lack
                        that cohesion and belief in their "men of light and leading" which are the
                        fundamental essentials of self-government.</p>

                        <head>Suez Canal Profits.</head>
                        <p>When Lord Beaconsfield arranged the bargain with Ismail Pachs, the
                            Extravagant, for the purchase of the latter's share of the Suez Canal,
                            many eminent Radicals denounced the transaction as not only risky but as
                            opposed to all righteousness. But, nowadays, the screaming virtue of
                            that political cult prefers to keep silence, meanwhile pocketing the
                            profits from the greatest international deal of a commercial character
                            that has ever occurred. In the annual report of the Liverpool Stamship
                            Owners' Association it is stated that since the Khedive's shares passed
                            into British ownership the aggregate money yield has amounted to nine
                            and a half millions sterling. As the purchase price was no more than
                            four millions, the net profit up to the end of last year works out at
                            five and a half millions. But the golden stream has only been flowing
                            into the English Treasury, since the end of 1899; up to that date all
                            receipts were used to pay interest charges on the four millions borrowed
                            to carry out the bargain and to liquidate the capital sum. It was not,
                            therefore, until the beginning of 1900 that John Bull came into the nice
                            little addition to his income placed at his service by the great
                            Conservative statesman. During the six years that have subsequently
                            passed the average annual profit has amounted to nearly a million
                            sterling, while the original outlay has been recouped without taking a
                            single farthing out of the British taxpayer's purse.</p>

                    <p>General Machacha and the members of the Abyssibian Mission will leave
                        Alexandria for Jerusalem in all probability tomorrow or the day after. A
                        "Gazette" representative interviewed the General this morning through an
                        interpreter as he does not speak Arabic well, and he stated that he hopes
                        that he will recover the £25,000 taken from him at Constantinople on his
                        arrival at Jerusalem He declared that the money had been taken from him on
                        board the steamer at the moment of embarking, by a man of Hungarian origin,
                        who had been in his service for two years. This man, said the General, had
                        been induced to seize the money by an Abyssinian ecclesiastic at Jerusalem.
                        For some time past this dignity had been on bad terms with the General, who
                        expressed vehement dislike for him. The money has been sent to Jerusalem and
                        the General will take measures to have the sum restored to him.</p>

                    <p>INCIDENT WITH TURKISH TROOPS.</p>
                    <p>The "Lewa" states that the Turkish occupation of Tabah, is based on the
                        belief that the Sinai is in no sense a part of Egypt but a territory
                        temporarily confided to Egyptian care. If this be so, the outlook is not
                        altogether pleasant, but we imagine that the confusion between Tabah and
                        Dabah is far more likely to have caused the incident.</p>
                    <p>Our contemporary also states that Turkish troops are close to Keaat-en-Nakhl,
                        but have not occupied the port. It adds that Mr. F. J Bramley and 25
                        soldiers landed near Tabah from the Nour-el-Bahr and met the Turkish
                        commandant, who refared to retire, whereupon the Egyptians withdrew.</p>

                    <p>Suez, Thursday. </p>
                    <p>A southerly gale raged at Suez all last night and only abated this morning.
                        Owing to the gale and fog in the canal, all steamers had to tie up,and most
                        of them anchored for the night at Ismailia, only proceeding at 8 o'clock
                        this morning, when the weather was somewhat clearer. Among the detained
                        vessels was the P. &amp; O. mail steamer Marmora, which only reached Suez
                        this afternoon, being 12 hours late.</p>
                    <p>The weather, although not quite settled yet, seems to be clearing up.</p>
                    <p>Steamers coming up from the south report thick weather in the Suez Golf, on
                        account of which they had to slow down.</p>

                    <p>The Zetland Lodge (No. 116 F. E. C.) held a must successful installation
                        meeting on Tuesday last. This ceremony was attended by the Deputy District
                        Grand Master, Dr. Keatinge, and several other officers of the District Grand
                        Lodge of Egypt and the Sudan. There were also many visitors from other
                        lodges. Worshipful Brother Walter F. Sarjeaut, the retiring Master,
                        performed the ceremony of installation of Brother Irvine in a most able
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards &amp; banqaet was held in the ballroom of the New Khedivial Hotel.
                        The fare provided was excellent and the greatest cordially prevailed. The
                        usual Masonic toasts were given, interspersed by a charming selection of

                    <head>CONCERT AT THE SAVOY HOTEL.</head>
                    <p>He is a brave man who follows on the footsteps of Signor Serato, but Mr.
                        Kaufman, young as he is, acquitted himself admirably yesterday afternoon
                        when he and his aunt, Mrs. Amster, gave one of the many delightful concerts
                        of the Cairo season. It is unfair to compare Mr. Kaufman's playing with that
                        of Signor Serato, who has already won the hearts of his hearers, but Mr.
                        Kaufman has very much in his favour and will cortainly make a name for
                        himself. Perhaps it was a natural diffidence that made his Sonata by Griega
                        somewhat colourless performance, the first movement perceptibly dragging his
                        second item. Bruch's second concert, was very much more spontaneous and full
                        of feeling, and his final numbers were delightful in their purity tone and
                        fineness of expression. His rendering of that delicate fantasy of Bazzini's,
                        La Ronde des Lutins, with its subtle intervals and difficult bowing, was
                        above criticism. In response to the insistence of the audience Mr. Kaufman
                        gave as an encore Pierne's Seranado, which he played with a mute, and which
                        was received with every mark of satisfaction. His technique is indeed
                        excellent, and his tone</p>
                    <p>sure, if sometimes lacking in force, but he possesses a fine feeling and a
                        very refined artistic sense.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Amster, the beautiful and talented wife of Dr. Amster, received a very
                        warm welcome from her many friends and admirers, and her songs by Brahma,
                        Schumann, and Schubert were duly appreciated. She has a beautifully
                        sympathetic and flexible voice and sings with much delicacy and
                        intelligence. In her two last songs by Horwitz she was accompanied by the
                        composer, who is a son-in-law of Heller's.</p>
                    <p>Mme, Archibald and Mr. Schweitzer acted as accompaniats and performed their
                        allotted parts in a most sympathetic and able manner.</p>
                    <p>There will be another concert at the Savoy Hotel on Sunday evening, when Frau
                        Professor Schear Brodmann, of Wiesbaden, and Mr. Buop Giesen, of Dresden wll
                        appear, from Bro'mann is a very roted operatic singer in Vienna and her
                        performances have received frequent expressions of approval from the Emperor
                        William. Mr. Giessen is also well known on account of his fine tenorr
                        voice.</p>

                    <head>The Gordon College</head>
                    <p>Higher Technical School</p>
                    <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE SYLLABUS.</p>
                    <p>The Higher Technical Sobool was formed and its courses were arranged on the
                        lines suggested. It was opened in October, 1905, and fifteen students
                        presented themselves-seven from the Gordon College Sobool, seven from
                        Omdurman, and one from the Gamalieh School, Cairo. They are divided into two
                        sections or sides, seven studying surveying in a two years' and eight
                        engineering in a four years' course. At present it would be premature to
                        give details of the syllabus as though it were definitely fixed. The school
                        is still in an experimental stage, and at the age of five months it is hard
                        even for parents to prophesy how a child will develop. Meantime the
                        instructors hope to be able to follow a course that will continne the boy's
                        general education while adding to it a definite and sound technical
                        training. Here is the syllabus as proposed for the first year. In general
                        subjects, the English, the translation and the Arabic composition will be
                        simply a continuation of the work done in the higher primary schools.
                        Geography and mathematics, on the other hand, will now be taught for the
                        first time in English. The geography will consist partly of the
                        recapitulation of the general geography already learnt with a special
                        reference to the dominions of the British Empire, and partly of a more
                        detailed treatment of the Nile Valley from fresh points of view, such as the
                        engineer's, the trader's, and the agriculturalist's.</p>
                    <p>The mathematics tanght will be a repetition and extension in English of the
                        arithmetic and geometry previously learnt in Arabic, and in addition to
                        these the elements of algebra and trigonometry.</p>
                    <p>Technical Subjects. </p>
                    <p>a) SURVEYORS. - The surveyer's work will be partly practical, partly
                        theoretical. The practical field work includes practice in chain- surveying,
                        angular surveying, and levelling, while trigonometrical surveying will be
                        described. The field implements and instruments used are ranging rods and
                        pickets, chains and arrows, optical square and cross staff, tape, prismatic
                        compass, plane table, and Cooke's level. The office work will consist of
                        construction of plain and diagonal scales, use and selection of plotting and
                        offset scales, plotting to scale from survey and level field notes,
                        computation of "traverse sheet" of co-ordinates, taking out areas by
                        triangles and trapeziums, use of planimeter, preparation of tracing and
                        blue-prints.</p>
                    <p>b) ENGINEERS.—The engineers' work, like the surveyor's, is both practical and
                        theoretic, and as the subject is much wider, the courses will be more
                        extended and will probably last longer. In the first year an attempt will be
                        made to give the students a superficial acquaintance with a number of
                        branches which will be only treated fully in subsequent years. Their work
                        falls into three main divisions.</p>
                    <p>Manual Training.</p>
                    <p>Each boy will spend about eight hours a week in one of the instructional
                        workshops, learning the handicrafts of carpentering, fitting, smithing and
                        engine-driving, passing half a year in each shop. </p>
                    <p>Mechanical Drawing.</p>
                    <p>Boys will be taught the use of instruments, of tracing paper and cloth,
                        colouring and mounting drawings, working and detail drawings the
                        reproduction of drawings by sun photo-printing. </p>
                    <p>Lectures</p>
                    <p>These will consist during the first year of a series of courses illustrated
                        whenever possible by practical demonstration on the elements of mensuration
                        of areas, solids, etc. hydraulics, statics, building and engineering
                        materials, constructional work, tools and implements. In later years these
                        courses will be expanded and supplemented by proper testing operations in
                        the laboratory. Students will be taught further how to write reports, draw
                        contracts, and check work done.</p>
                    <p>Our readers can form an opinion of the value of the training thus given. It
                        seems practical enough, and will, perhaps, be of value not for the Sodan
                        only. Technical education requires development in Egypt, and when that
                        development comes its organisers will not do amiss to take a leaf from the
                        Sudan educational book.</p>

                    <p>Education In Egypt</p>
                    <p>LATE MUFTI'S "POLITICAL WILL."</p>
                    <p>"Al Lewa" says :-Mr. de Guerville allowed, himself to publish in his book
                        "New Egypt" the opinions of Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, in regard to the lack of
                        public instruction in Egypt, because, thinks the author, the late Mufti's
                        statement, being a part of his political will, must be declared after his
                        death. No doubt the English would have felt displeased with the late
                        Sheikh's opinion, which shows how little cared for education is in Egypt.
                        But they must consider, if they are a just people, that no native of this
                        country can be pleased with the backwardness of Egypt and the loss of its
                        authority. In spite of England's attempts to support its purposes in Egypt
                        by concealing the real facts and buying the unscrupulous writers' pens, the
                        reality, obvious as it looks, cannot be suppressed and the voice of Egypt
                        will never cease to declare its rights.</p>
                    <p>After quoting the late Mufti's statement, "Al Lewa" concludes as
                        follows:-</p>
                    <p>"Now what do the occupants think of Sheikh Mohamed Abdou's declaration ? Was
                        he also one of those who opposed the English Occupation and severely
                        criticised its policy, as they say?"</p>
                    <p>The Red Sea and England. </p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pacha Kamel makes the following remarks in "Al Lewa '' :--The most
                        important scheme of the British Government is to detach Arabia from the
                        Turkish Empire and place its Government in the hands of an Arabian Caliph,
                        whom it would employ for its own ends. British statesmen are doing their
                        utmost in this direction, but their efforts have been unsuccessful. The
                        Ottoman Power has lately suppressed the Yemen rebellion, and the Hedjaz
                        Railway will completely join the Turkish capital with the sacred towns,
                        adding considerable force to the Ottoman Government, albeit, Port Sudan
                        which is the first English harbour in the Red Sea, now forms an important
                        naval station for the British forces before Jeddah. Therefore the railways,
                        though necessary and vital for the Ottoman Empire, will not do without a
                        real navy- powerful fleet to defend the Ottoman coasts and secure the Red
                        Sea as an Ottoman lake and not leave it to be converted into an English one.
                        It is a very sad thing to see England threatening Turkey and Islam by means
                        of Egypt and its money, while the Egyptian Ministry slumbers.</p>

                    <head>LONG CREDITS IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The following statement on the subject of credits in Egypt appears in the
                        "Manchester Guardian."</p>
                    <p>A Lancashire manufacturer who has tried the experiment of direct trading with
                        Egypt sends us a copy of the Monthly Journal of the British Chamber of
                        Commerce of Egypt, an article in which confirms his experience. Egypt, it is
                        agreed, is a country of long credits, the main causes being (1) that apart
                        from home consumption the cultivator produces only one selling crop per
                        annum of any value -usually cotton; (2) the ingrained habit of the native
                        not to honour his bills on the due date, and (3) the land-hunger which is so
                        strongly developed in the fellaheen. As the cultivator only handles ready
                        money in any quantity at one period of the year, he makes the retailer wait
                        for the account, who in his turn keeps the merchant waiting. But it is most
                        difficult for the British trader to understand the lightness with which the
                        Arab dishonours his acceptances. He regards those rather as the
                        acknowledgments of his debts than as positive obligations to pay them, and
                        his keeness to acquire land urges him to take advantags of any suitable
                        opportunity even at the expense of his credit. The great competition of the
                        last for years has mude very easy torms for the natives, and even when a
                        bill is renewed it is very difficult to include interest, one reason being
                        the religious objection of the Arab to its payment. On the whole, then, it
                        appears that unless a manufacturer can see his way to profits sufficiently
                        good to counterbalance the various financial disadvantages he had better
                        leave Egyptian trade to those who understand it. There seems to be no
                        reason, however, why his representatives, with the necessary experience,
                        should not understand it as well as anyone else.</p>
