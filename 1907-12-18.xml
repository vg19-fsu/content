                    <p>As reported by my telegram of to day Mr. Raoul Hector Foà, of Messrs. King
                        and Foà, has been appointed a director of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank (Limited).
                        The appointment is in many respects an interesting one. Mr. Foa's fatherMr.
                        Octave Foa--was for many years (from 1864 to 1881) the secretary and manager
                        of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, and was elected a director of that institution
                        in 1881. The "Standard" remarks that this is the first instance of a partner
                        in a private discount firm occupying at the same time a position on the
                        directorate of a bank. </p>

                    <p>We have much pleasure in announcing the inauguration of the series of
                        concerts, which the new Société des Concerts da Caire has undertaken to give
                        during the whole of the present season. The first concert, which took place
                        last Sunday,was in every way satisfactory. The Society was ' very happily
                        inspired in choosing the concert room of the Semiramis hotel, which meets

                        the committee had chosen with great taste and care. We must specially
                        mention the execution of Mozart's Jupiter symphony, and Wagner's "Siegfrid,"

                    <p>A decree nisi has been granted by the Divorce Division on the petition of
                        Lord Vivian, who sought for a dissolution of his marriage with Lady Vivian
                        on the ground of adultery. Mr Alfred Curphey, the well-known AngloEgyptian
                        financier, was the correspondent. </p>
                    <p>Lady Vivian was one of the belles of the last Cairo season and made a
                        prolonged stay at the Savoy Hotel. She is the daughter of the late Mr.
                        William A. Fanning and was married to Lord Vivian in 1903. There is one
                        daughter and one son by the marriage. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Alfred Curphey arrived at Alexandria last Wednesday by the S.S

                    <head>WATER COLOUR EXHIBITION. A FAMOUS ARTIST. </head>
                    <p>Many Alexandrian residents, and not a few of our étrangers en passage visited
                        yesterday the exhibition of water colour drawings, which are being displayed
                        at the Savoy Palace Hotel by Mr X 0. Lamplough, whose name is now placed in
                        the first rank of our present day artists : to this we must add that others,
                        who were unable to visit the exhibition yesterday or were unaware that it
                        was being held, can do so any morning or afternoon up to Monday next. </p>
                    <p>As regards Mr. Lamplougb's talent as an artist, we can add nothing to what we
                        have written in former years. On his first visit to Egypt we recognised his
                        genius and did not hesitate to express our opinion that a great future was
                        before him. That our opinion has been fully justified is proved by the
                        success which he has gained and by the general admiration which his
                        paintings have evoked. Few men have spanned the bridge of fame in so short a
                        time, and we doubt that any younger artist has ever been commanded to
                        exhibit his pictures in private to our Sovereign. Mr. Lamplough has,
                        moreover, gained the patronage of many other members of the Royal family,
                        besides other distinguished persons, whose names are well-known to
                        Franco-Egyptiang. </p>
                    <p>of the present exhibition it is only possible to say that each picture has
                        its individual merits; to criticise them is beyond our power, for on each we
                        can but bestow unstinted and absolutely genuine praise. We can but mention
                        our favourities, and these of course must depend opon personal choice. One
                        of the first | pictures which attracted our attention was a most delicately
                        coloured painting of "Doomed Philae," a replica of one of the two pictures
                        purchased by King Edward, though we are | almost inclined to note a
                        wonderfully nature </p>
                    <p>like painting of the Citadel at Cairo from Ghezireh as our first favourite.
                        "The first gleam of sunlight o'er river and bill," as the artist entitles
                        one of his pictures, is full of warmth and richness of colouring. The
                        painting of the tombs of the Mamelukes with the Pyramids in the far distance
                        gives especial prominence to that vast variety of colouring for which
                        Egyptian scenery is famous ; and, again, Mr. Lamplough has been faithful to
                        the point of perfection in his painting of "Mist effect near Kous." In the
                        foreground is a stretch of sand dunes, clear and well-defined and growing
                        gradually more and more indistinct, clusters of prickly pears are toned down
                        below their full richness of green, while behind rises a group of
                        date-palms, their trunks most cleverly hidden by mist, while their graceful,
                        fronded tops rise sharply above the dimming, moisture-soaked atmosphere to
                        boldly face the world, oblivious to the very humidity which gives them life.
                        Other pictures which we must put forward | as among our favourites are "An
                        afterglow near Tel el Kebir," "An afterglow in the desert," "Sheikh's tomb
                        near Matarieh," "On the Nile banks at Aşkonan," "Sunrise at Bardis," and "On
                        the Nile near Cairo." </p>

                    <p>The energetic members of this society presented for the amusement of their
                        members and friends on Saturday last Edmond Rostand's three act comedy "Les
                        Romanesques" and they are to be heartily congratulated on the unqualified
                        success of the entertainment. A large and fashionable gathering assembled to
                        witness the performance, among whom we noticed the | French Consul, Mons. P.
                        Girard. The play was prettily staged and each character was well supported.
                        Mlle Sequier made a charming Sylvette and M. J. Ruben proved himself equal
                        to all that was required in the lovemaking scenes, which, for an amateur, is
                        saying a good deal. As Straforel, Mons. Paul Levy I gave us, as he
                        invariably does, an excellent impersonation of the character, and in the
                        difficult scene in the third act with Sylvette excelled himselt. The rather
                        trying character of Bergamin was exceedingly well played by Mr. A. Paul who
                        is also to be complimented on the excellence of his make-up. The smaller
                        characters were also well sustained by Messrs. H. Lanmon and G. Lusena. </p>

                        of the masters, which was of a warlike nature and seriously threatened that
                        if two mills, at present closed by a strike, are not working shortly the
                        whole trade will stop. The masters intend to act as one man against the
                        anjust demands of the work-people in the ring as regards spinners' wages. In
                        the meantimo business is being conducted under strike clauses, which hamper

                        Graham, and Mr. Roccasera has been appointed, and will sit immediately to
                        consider the advisability of the decreos relating to the aewerage of Cairo
                        which came before the Court of Appeal for deliberation in May 1898 and in
                        January 1899, being presented to the Council of Ministers for consideration
                        in its present form. We understand that these decrees deal with the
                        localities in which the new system of sewers are to be laid. and also the
                        quarters in the town where work will be first commenced. </p>
                    <p>It is probable that the construction work will not be commenced before the
                        beginning of the year 1909 at the earliest, as detailed plads dealing with
                        all districts concerned will have to be prepared and this preliminary work
                        will occupy a considerable time, as there are many questions which will have
                        to be very carefully considered before the actual constructional work is
                        begun, also until the main sewers are laid, and the pumping installation and
                        the sewage farm are completed, it is highly improbable that any houses or
                        buildings can be connected with the system of sewers, so that for some
                        considerable time things will remain practically as they are now. : </p>
                    <p>We understand that the report of the Controller General is now before the
                        Adviser, and that it will be submitted for the consideration of the Council
                        of Ministers early in the coming year. It is probable that in the native

                    <p>On consideration of the question from various points of view it ooours to us
                        that many of the distriota which at present laok a sufficient water supply
                        should be the first consideration of the authorities, and now that the water
                        scheme is pratically approved of, there is no reason why the Caire Water
                        Company should not at once proceed to remedy this state of affairs. </p>
                    <p>We earnestly trust that the finding of the commission above mentioned will
                        favoar the immediate consideration of the previons de crees. The question is
                        one of much importance to the whole towr, and if the decree: formerly

                    <p>Dr. Ruffer President of the quarantine Board of Egypt, who has made some
                        valuable contributions to the discussiong of the International Hygiene
                        Conference now in sessionhere, has been appointed a member of the Committee
                        charged with drafting regulations for the establishment in Paris of an
                        International Bureau of Hygiene. </p>
                    <p>The delegates of France proposed that the ex per.ses of the Bureau should not
                        exceed £6,000 yearly. The Italian representatives, however, soggested £8,000
                        and Learly all the other delegates, including those of Frauce, were ready to
                        accept the suggestion, but Dr. Thomson (Eng. land) insisted that the sum
                        should be limited to £6,000. He was supported by Sir Benjamin Franklyn,
                        representative of India, and alti mately carried the point. </p>
                    <p>It was also arranged that each country should choose to which of six
                        specified categories it wished to belong, paying a quota accordingly, and
                        having a proportionate number of votes. Great Britain and India chose the
                        first category, and are entitled to six votes each. Ibrahina Pisha Neghib
                        declared that Egypt chose the fourth category, which entitles her to three
                        dotes. </p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA CONSERVATOIRE.</head>
                    <p>We published a report in Monday's issue of the concert on Saturday night at
                        the Alexandria Conservatoire, but the following account from another point
                        of view will be of interest: - </p>
                    <p>The coup d'oeil from the gallery opposite the stage was charming and the
                        troop of young men, maidons and children, so nicely dressed as they stood on
                        the stage for the opening chorus made a most satisfactory impression on the
                        audience. After five years' steady work onder their capable and hard-working
                        profeg. nors the progress made is very creditable and those who have been
                        interesting themselves in this institution from the beginning can bear
                        witness to the rapid development made by the pupils of the Alexandria
                        Conservatoire. All nationalities are represented in the classes, but those
                        pupils who were best fitted to take part in the evening's programóne as
                        soloists were drawn from the Italian, Greek and' Armenian communities. The
                        opening chorus was wellrendered and went with a steady swing, responding
                        with precision to Signor Galletti's båton and showing a greatly improved
                        discipline since they first came under his direction. </p>
                    <p>This was followed by a trio of Haydn's which was played by three Armenian
                        popils. Messrs. Tirighinan E. and J. Papasian, The third item was a violin
                        solo played by a small boy of seven, M. Cantom, a papil of Signor Lama who
                        played his piece from the famous Barber of Seville with astonishing
                        precision and tunefulness and did not seem in the least abashed by the sea
                        of faces below him. The song by Meyerbeer given by a Greek pupil was one of
                        the numbers most appreciated on the programme. Mr. Lambrides should have a
                        future before him if he continues studying with the same reserve and
                        refinement as be showed in his performance last night and he does infinite
                        credit to the good teaching of Signor Galletti. </p>
                    <p>Another Greek pupil, Sig. Perdichidis, delighted his hearers by his rendering
                        of an extremely sympathetic piece by E. Papasiad (another popil) which was
                        followed by Raff's famous Cavatina. Mr. Lambridis is an example of a pupil
                        absolutely created by the Alexandria Conservatoire and he has been trained
                        from the very begining by Prof. Lama. The first part was brought to a close
                        by a brilliant performance of a favourite Schezzo of Mendelssohn by a girl
                        of 14, Signa. Carasao. </p>
                    <p>Part 2 opened with another chorus in which Sign. Azzarelli took the soprano
                        solo. She is very promising but the voice is still in its earlier stage and
                        we hope she will not overstrajn her voice whilst her throat and constitution
                        are yet unequal to any great effort. We were glad to hear Sig. R. Scinica
                        again, who has made distinct progress, but we should prefer to hear him in
                        less ambiticus and more sympathetic pieces another time. A duet by Schumann
                        came next by "Sigra. Mangeri and Sig. Papanti, an Aria by Lindner for the
                        violoncello given carefully by Sig. J. Papasian and an Andantino by Chopin
                        was played by another member of the Cantoni fainily on the oboe-class lately
                        formed and under the guidance of Prof. Onesti. A chorus by Bach"Sanctus," a
                        fugue in 4 parts, was admirably rendered by the whole of the vocal strength
                        of the Conservatoire and brought a most interest. ing concert to an end. We
                        cannot close this critique without saying a word about the Director, Maestro
                        Colella, who being still in deep mouming took no part in the proceedings,
                        but to whom is due all praise for the creatiou and organisation of this
                        Alexandria Soboot of music, which is doing him so much credit: </p>

                    <dateline> Esneh, December 11th. </dateline>
                    <p>It is only when one realizes the hundreds of men working upon them, the
                        thousands of tons of material need in building them, the energies and years
                        that are spent in their completion, that one begins to wonder if the modern
                        barrage of Egypt will ever rank among the hoary monuments of the future as
                        have the pyramids of the past: or whether they too will one day pasg into
                        nothingness like so many of the other great works of the country </p>
                    <p>A visit to Esneh at the present moment will make one think of many things;
                        but it is almost impossible to watch the scenes of activity, round the
                        construction of the mammoth weir, without being reminded of similar scenes
                        in byėgone ages, when Egyptian kings were engaged in raising monumental
                        works either for the good of the land or to their own | glory. To-day there
                        are the samé gangs of busy workers swarming over the scene : only instead of
                        slave labour groaning under a cruel joke they are free men working for fair
                        and honest wage and protected by many a modern institation. The ingenuity of
                        the times has naturally supplied many labour saving contrivances unheard of
                        in the past ; but the Egyptian setting and the Egyptian type is still the
                        same, and where the modern workman is left to his own devices he will use
                        the same methods as did his far away ancestors. The very stone used in the
                        building of the present dam reminds one of the past. There are the huge
                        blocks of granite brought from Assouan as of yore, and Gebel Sillah is still
                        supplying vast quantities of the same material which centuries ago was being
                        brought down river to build the palaces and temples of Thebes and Karnak. </p>
                    <p>The sleepy native town of Esneh with its temple and other, antiquities lies
                        upon the western bank of the river': the bustle and clamour of the barrage
                        works is confined for the most part to the eastern bank where all is desert
                        if not desolation between the railway station and the river. bank.
                        Desolation of a Bort: for enormous heaps of stone, brick yards and other
                        unlovely sights cumber the ground, while the throb of machinery and the
                        paffing and screaming ofengines fill the air with their clamour. There close
                        to the river has arisen the little settlement which is the head quar ters
                        for all who have to do with the work There is the busy station yard where
                        trucks of sto ne are continually being unladen : there are offices and
                        stores; and there too the bungalows which have grown to be the homes of the
                        European workers, Bungalows of white 'with green shutters and verandahs for
                        the goverment official,. one storied bungalows yellow. washed, for those in
                        the employ of John Aird and Co. And in spite of arid desertand other
                        disadvantages, these bungalows have grown into very comfortable homes ;
                        their wide verandabs mostly sbaded with luxuriant creepers, lootab plants,
                        convolvulus ; while their patches of I garden are bright with carefully
                        tended flowers, marigolds, sunflowers thriving apace in the sandy, soil. </p>
                    <p>A few minutes walk across the intervening hummocks and one is in the midst of
                        a scene of ceaseless activity. The steep banks swarm with myriads of blue
                        garbed workmen, endless streams of snarling camels block the way. One side a
                        great angainly mud-dredger is cattingite way through a narrow canal, on the
                        other the great slope of masonry supports one end of the daily growing dam
                        which ere long will lie athwart the stream. It is good to stand there for a
                        few minutes and watch that swarm of human bees, each doing his very best in
                        his · </p>
                    <p>seeming futile way, and the great edifice Tgrowing, growing as certainly as

                        side from the bank into the stream, from which tons and tons of earth are
                        being hurled overboard into the water. Much sooner than one thinks that
                        earth will form a sud that tops the surface and makes a solid bank round a
                        portion of the river bed, when the water enclosed can be puinped away and
                        buildmg operations may be begun. Great floors of </p>
                    <p>cement and concrete pitched on either side I with walls of lime-stone, will
                        give foundation </p>

                        more the masonery is ready to be continued above its aur. face. On the
                        western bank there is more to see. Already the lock walls are completed with
                        the loug Alights of steps leading to the road. way. Already many of the
                        piers have reached their full height ; and before the next rise of the river
                        they must all be well above the flood. When that time comes the worst of the
                        work will be over and the three-quarters of a mile I width of river will be

                    <p>Bat when one thinks that it is less than two yesirs ago that the first
                        preparations were made, that the actual building operations only commenced
                        last March, one can will believe that the finishing touches will be given at
                        no very distant date. Refetence has already been made to the institutions
                        for the protection of the modern workman, and chief among these at Esneh is
                        the hospital which has been erected by John Aird and Co. on the western bank
                        of the river between the town and the barrage works. A well laid out and
                        shady garden ser rounds the various warda, ench with a wide verándah and
                        most comfortable aspect. There <cb n="6"/> are wards for English and
                        Italians as well as for the natives, and an isolation ward for fever </p>
                    <p>ases. There is also a very complete operating theatre, for as may be imagined
                        most of the cases treated are the results of accidente.. An English doctor
                        is in residence here with a . staff of male nurses, and many an Eoglish cot.
                        age hospital is not so well equipped and arranged as this little one on the
                        banks of the river Nile. </p>

                    <p>The annual meeting of the Khedivial Mail Steamship and Graving Dock Company
                        (Limited) was held on the 9th inst. at Wineheater House, Mr. Charles A.
                        Hanson-presided. </p>
                    <p>The notice convening the meeting having been read by the secretary (Mr. L
                        Holiday) the report and accounts (which have already appeared in the
                        "Shipping Gazette,") were taken as read. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman: I am sure you will all join me in greatly regretting the
                        absence from our meeting to-day, through severe and protracted illness, of
                        our most capable and distinguished chairman, Sir Anchlaud Colvin, and I have
                        no doubt it will be your wish that I should convey to him an expression of
                        your sincere sympathy and of our best wishes for his early and complete
                        recovery. The year which ended on June 30 last was, I am glad to say on the
                        whole a satisfactory year. In comparison with 1905-1906 the traffic earnings
                        have shown increases from almost every service worked by the company. and
                        from almost every source of revenue which has been available to the company.
                        The only rexceptions which I think can be made to this general rule and the
                        earnings from the Suez factory, from the floating dock at Alexandria, and
                        from the revenue derived from the international mail service. In these items
                        there have been decreases but, the decreases are trifling and of no serious
                        importance. </p>
                    <p>The Pilgrim Traffic</p>
                    <p>In analysing the accounts for the year we find that the lagest increase of
                        revenue has come to us from the pilgrim trade, which last year luckily
                        happened to be exceptionally good. The pilgrim trade, as you are probably
                        aware, is an omportant branch of our service, and is an important source of
                        revenue, but in this, as in all other departments of trade and traffic,
                        there are good years and bad years, and sometimes it may happen that our
                        carrying power is taxed to its utmost capacity with large earnings, while at
                        other times our tonnage may be largely in excess of the requirements with
                        coreesponginly small earnings, This pilgrim trade is, however, an extremely
                        onerous trade, as we are obliged to provide for every emergency and to make
                        our organisation and service as perfect as possible to satisf the exacting
                        requirements of the Government of Egypt, and to secure for the satifation of
                        the pilgrims themselves that they are carried with safety and comfort.</p>

                    <head>Devidend</head>
                    <p>The net Restrit of the whole year is that, notwithstanding our increased
                        expenditure both for ordinary account and special repairs to ships, and
                        leaving also provided an additional fund for extraordinary depreciation, we
                        are still able to recommend to you the declaration of a dividend at the rate
                        of 10 per cent. per annum, and to carry forward to the next year's accounts
                        a trifle over 13,000l. I hope you will consider this on the whole a not
                        unsatifactory record.</p>
                    <p>New Capital</p>
                    <p>Referring again to the report, I may perhaps be permitted to refer to the
                        paragraph wich relates to the issue of new capital. You will recollect that
                        a year ago the directors asked you for additional capital powers, and you
                        very generously accessed to our request. At that time two facts were
                        prominent in our minds, viz : First, the necessity for building two or three
                        new first class steamers. Secondly, the necessity of finding the funds for
                        building these vessels, and for other capital purposes, by an issue of new
                        capital. At that time the financial sky was comparatively unclouded. The
                        financial condition of Egypt particularly appeared to be eminently
                        satisfactory, and we were assured and had reason to believe that Egypt was
                        eager to join with London in finding this capital at an appreciable premium
                        upon its par value, and at such a premium as would be satisfactoru to the
                        directors: and there is no doubt, indeed, that had we been in a position at
                        the time to take advantage of that situation, we should have been able to
                        issue our capital successfully and with great advantage to the company.
                        Things, however, changed rapidly, and when we were ready the markets were
                        less favourable- so much less favourable, indeed, that the directors did not
                        deem it an opportune moment to place the shares upon the maket. </p>

                    <p>London, December 10. As has been already intimated in these notes, Colonel R.
                        ©. Cox will vacate the com- mand of the 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling
                        Fusiliers, Alexandria, on the 26th prox. on completion of his four years at
                        its head. Co- lonel Cox got his first commission iy the old 27th
                        Inniskillings in June, 1879, got his com- pany in 1887 and majority in 1898.
                        He served with the Ist Battalion in the South African war, and commanded it
                        for the last two years of the stuggle with much ability in the fighting in
                        the Transvaal, Orange River Colony and Cape Colony (mentioned in despatchesm
                        brevet Lieutenant Colonelcy, Queen's medal with five clasps)</p>
                    <p>Major H.O.D. Hickman, second in command of the 1st Battalion, Crete, has been
                        selected for the command of the 2nd Battalion, the step going to him in the
                        usual course, he being the senior major of both battalions. Major Hickman is
                        a very smart and popular officer and a staff college man as well. HE has
                        spent since Janurary 1890 in the Inneskillings, and prior to that he was
                        nine years in the Green Howards. He was attached to the Egyptian Army from
                        1885 to 1889, a portion of which time he was Assissant Military Scretary to
                        the Sirdar so that his previous Egyptian service will be in his favour when
                        he goes to the head of the 2nd Battalion. He served in the Nile Expedition,
                        1884-85 (medal with clasp,star); Soudan campaign, 1888, including the action
                        Gemaizah (clasp, th class Medjidie); and the South African war 1901-02,
                        inclusive of the actions of Belfast and Lydenburgh and the operations in
                        Cape Colony, Natal, and the Transvaal (Queen's medal with two clasps). </p>

                        s'attend plutot a une accentuation de la faiblesse. Dans de telles

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
