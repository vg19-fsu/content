                    <head>THE DOMINATION OF THE SEAS.</head>
                    <p>A telegram from Berlin to-day states that the German Navy estimates show an
                        increase of over sixteen millions of marks, and a new naval programme of
                        considerable dimensions is to be taken in hand. Since the Germans have
                        translated and read Mahan's "Influence of Sea Power on History" they have
                        accepted as a cardinal article of their political creed the dictum that
                        Germany's future is on the water. Since then they have set to work to
                        prepare that future. They have a Navy League, which issues its general
                        survey of the subject, its outlines, its manuals, its treatises, and its
                        year-books. Thus intellectually prepared they are ready to vote their
                        millions for the new Navy which has been planned on solid foundations and is
                        growing apace. The drift of all this busy, unflagging preparation can hardly
                        be doubtful. For years there was the same hum of an Army making ready, the
                        same keen attention to military affairs, the same drilling of soldiers and
                        training of officers before Germany hurled herself irresistibly on France,
                        full of sanguine confidence in her success. In the same manner there can be
                        no doubt that Germany is arming herself with patient, calculating, and
                        laborious perseverance for the day when she shall at last feel ready to
                        throw <cb n="6"/>down the gauntlet of defiance in the face of England.
                        Germany is of those that look, meditate, and prepare before they leap, in
                        order that they need have to leap but once. </p>
                    <p>Ten years ago the German Navy was a negligible quantity, consisting of only
                        three first-class and ten second-class, and mostly old battleships. The
                        latter were little more than coast defence vessels, and in comparisons of
                        naval strength at this period Germany was usually ignored. Only four
                        millions sterling annually was spent on the fleet, while France was laying
                        out over ten millions sterling and Great Britain nearly 174 millions. To-day
                        the annual expenditure on the German fleet exceeds ten millions annually.
                        This is due to the Kaiser's determination to do for the navy what his
                        grandfather did for the army. A modest programme of shipbuilding spread over
                        seven years was introduced in 1898, but meantime an official propaganda had
                        been started, and in 1900 a new measure, superseding that of two years
                        before, was passed. Under this measure the fleet is being doubled in size
                        and will consist of : 38 battleships, 14 large cruisers, 38 small cruisers.
                        Built and building Germany has thirty-three battleships already.</p>
                    <p>The question which we should ask ourselves is whether the ambition to command
                        the sea is not the natural and legitimate ambition of every Great Power with
                        a seaboard and a seaborne trade. There can be but one answer to that
                        question. The idea of a great nation, second to none in the elements of
                        strength, provided by the combination of population, industry, and
                        organisation, contentedly acquiescing in the second place is logically
                        inadmissible. Our countrymen are apt to assume as a matter of course and of
                        right that Britannia rules the waves. But by what right can Great Britain
                        claim a perpetual monopoly of the first place ! That is the fundamental
                        question of British national policy, and the test of statesmanship among our
                        countrymen ought to be the capacity to give it a clear answer. The Admiralty
                        cannot deal with the problem of right; for the Admiralty the only answer is
                        "keep who can." In the same way, from Germany's point of view, her policy is
                        both natural and reasonable and the practical thing is not to be angry with
                        the Germans, whose duty it is to think of their country's future and of her
                        greatness, but to consider the foundations, in right and in might, of the
                        greatness of our own country.</p>

                    <head>JEWS AND GREEKS IN CYPRUS.</head>
                    <p>An interesting question is agitating the inhabitants of Cyprus, the point
                        under discussion being the establishment of a Jewish colony in that island.
                        The idea of a Jewish colony has been mooted for some years past, but last
                        spring M. David Triesch, representing the Oriental Jews' Colonisation
                        Society, began nogotiations with the High Commissioner. One of the deputies
                        asked a question in the Chamber, and was told that the Government did not
                        intend to give Jewish immigrants any exceptional privileges, but would deal
                        with them under the regulations concerning concessions of Crown lands. The
                        Cypriotes then began to agitate against the coming of the Jews, and
                        petitions are being signed all over the Island. There are already a number
                        of Jews in Cyprus, and they live on terms of equality and peace with the
                        Greeks. But the excuse for the agitation is that the newcomers will swamp
                        the rest of the population, and that the social and political life of the
                        island will be altered by them.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday, about 7.30 p.m. a fire broke out in a European lady's house,
                            situated opposite the British Headquarters, Alexandria. The female
                            servant of the house had placed a lighted candle on a small table near a
                            bedstead, and the mosquito-net by some means or the other had caught
                            fire. Boxes filled with new dresses and other articles of valye were
                            burnt, but the fire was ultimately put out by the neighbours and the
                            bowab of the house. The amount of the damage done is estimated at 5,000
                            francs, which is not covered by insurance.</p>

                        addressed you from Abbassieh upon this subject, is hardly likely to be
                        followed, for I have the misfortune to be an old bachelor and, therefore,
                        from a certain point of view, one of life's failures. However, I would
                        tender my experience- extending over more years than I care to remember-for
                        what it may be worth. I find the best plan is to pay my cook an agreed sum
                        per diem and see that I get a fair amount of board for my expenditure. I
                        dare say he makes something out of me in excess of his wages, but I believe
                        he would make more it I were to board myself, and by my present arrangement
                        I am saved endless trouble and vexation. Of course, I can well see the
                        objection which a thrifty housewife would raise if she were to be told by
                        her lord and master to follow this system. She would not be enabled to make
                        those little economies which she could squander in finery, carriages, and
                        what she would be pleased to denominate in generic terms "keeping up
                        appearances." I, of course, would say, "so much the better ;" but, then, I
                        am perhaps incapable of judging. However, if my counsel is rejected by
                        married couples, it may still prove serviceable to the single of both sexes,
                        of whom, I presume, there are a few still remaining.</p>

                    <head>A MUSICAL PHENOMENON.</head>
                    <p>Alexandria possesses a musical phenomenon in the person of Master Marco
                        Foscolo, who, although still a boy, is pronounced by connoisseurs to be one
                        of the most. remarkable violinists of the age. His genius is to be trained
                        in one of the first Conservatoires of Europe, and in order to raise the
                        necessary funds for that purpose a concert will be given by Master Foscolo
                        on Friday next, the 2nd December, at the New Khedivial Hotel. Miss Hoesli
                        will give her talented aid to ensure the success of this musical treat,
                        which should be heartily appreciated. Some details regarding this youthful
                        genius will be of interest to our readers. The boy's father lost the whole
                        of his money and consequence abandoned his wife who, left to her own
                        resources, pluckily brought up her family of four entirely by giving music
                        lessons. Master Marco has always loved music and seems unfitted for any
                        other particular work, as he is so absorbed in his taste, but his mother is
                        still in a very struggling condition, and cannot afford the actual outlayfor
                        voyage, outfit, etc., in sending her son to a conservatoire. Therefore, the
                        idea of a concert for raising the funds was mooted. </p>
                    <p>The boy is 17 years of age, and a pupil of Mr. Artelli, who deserves the very
                        highest praise for all he has done to help on this young genius in a way
                        that I am afraid few of us could.</p>

                    <p>On assure que la reaction actuelle n'est que passagere et va bientot faire

                    <p>A l'assemblée générale extraordinaire de la Société Agricole et Industrielle
                        d'Egypte, tenue le 12 novembre, le Conseil d'administra- tion a exposé
                        qu'après une visite de l'admi- nistrateur-directeur général au Caire,
                        présen- tant la situation favorable de la société, mal- gré la hausse
                        importante des terrains en Egypte et laissant encore une sensible marge à
                        plus- value, a exprimé le désir de voir augmenter les moyens financiers de
                        la societe. Apres de nombreux pourparlers, le conseil d'adminis- tration a
                        décide de convoquer les actionnaires en vue de leur demander l'autorisation
                        d'aug- menter le capital actions qui serait porte, en cas d'approbation, de
                        7 1/2 à 10 millions de francs. Les nouvelles actions seraient emises au
                        pair, soit à 500 frs. Les porteurs actuels joui- iraient d'un droit de
                        preference à la souscription. L'exercice actuel cloturant le 31 janvier pro-
                        chain, les nouvelles actions ne participeraient qu'aux bénéfices de
                        l'exercice 1905-1906. En ver- tu des statuts, le nombre des actions de
                        dividen- de ne sera pas augmenté. L'assemblée autorise unanimement
                        l'augmentation du capital-actions, de même elle autorise le conseil à
                        emettre pour fr. 15,000,000 d'obligations 4 p.c. en une ou plusieurs fois à
                        un taux à déterminer ultérieu- rement. Il est entendu que le conseil pourra
                        surseoir à toute emission si quelque chose d'anormal se presentait et qu'il
                        est libre de conclure l'opération au moment qu'il jugera opportun. Comme
                        suite à l'augmentation du capital sollicitée, les articles 5 et 9 des
                        statuts sont modifies dans ce sens. Quant a l'article II, visant
                        l'augmentation du nombre des admi- nistrateurs, l'assemblée, sur l'avis du
                        conseil, décide de laisser ce nombre invarié.</p>

                            better fitted for the carriage of goods and passengers. </p>
                        <p>The Board are of opinion that in dealing with this question it is only
                            fair to take into consideration the fact that these erections are of
                            considerable value as protective spaces to the ship, and are not in a
                            great many cases primarily intended to carry cargo, although cargo can
                            be stored in them. This view was strongly represented to the Suez Canal
                            Company, and they, after consulting other countrics immediately
                            concerned in the question, have decided to adopt a method of measurement
                            in which due allowance is made for this view, and have issued new
                            regulations on the subject. </p>
                        <p>Having regard to the literal construction that may be placed upon the
                            provisions of the Constantinople Rules on this point, the Board have
                            decided that the regulations in question afford a satisfactory solution
                            of the difficulties attending this question, and are issuing
                            instructions (of which a copy is enclosed) to their officers in the
                            matter.</p>

                            respecting the new arrangement with the Suez Canal Company regarding the
                            measurement of the deck spaces of vessels, I am directed by the Board of
                            Trade to state, for the information of the Chamber of Shipping of the
                            United Kingdom, that they have received a letter through the Foreign
                            Office from the British directors of the Suez Canal Company, stating
                            that the company have decided to reimburse the dues levied on deck
                            spaces in the case of vessels which under the new arrangement will be
                            exempted from such charges, and that the reimbursements will be made as
                            soon as the arrangement in question comes into operation.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <p>The Chamber of Shipping have addressed a long letter signed by the
                            secretary (Mr. W. H. Cooke), dated November 7, to the Marine Department
                            of the Board of Trade, expressing dissent from the understanding arrived
                            at by the Board with the Suez Canal Company, on the ground that it is
                            not a satisfactory settle- ment of the questions at issue. We append the
                            following extracts from this letter :- </p>
                        <p>"It appears to have been assumed that the Suez Canal Company were
                            justified in including the partially enclosed spaces in the Suez Canal
                            tonnage, and, practically, the Board of Trade have only succeeded in
                            getting some allowances made alongside the engine and boiler casings. </p>
                        <p>"When it is considered that in many vessels the officers and engineers
                            are berthed inside the midship house and alongside the casings referred
                            to, and that such erections are already included in the tonnage and
                            afterwards deducted as crew space, it is obvious that the deductions or
                            allowances secured by the Board of Trade are altogether insignificant. </p>
                        <p>"Several vessels have been measured to ascertain how their tonnage would
                            be affected, when these allowances are taken into account, as compared
                            with the measurement proposed by the Suez Canal Company before the
                            intervention of the Board of Trade, with the result that the allowances
                            will amount to only about 10 per cent. of the extra tonnage on which
                            dues would have been charged by the Suez Canal Company.</p>
                        <p>"But it has to be borne in mind that, if the arrangement made with the
                            Board of Trade be carried out, dues may be charged on the additional
                            space, even though it should never be used for the stowage of cargo ;
                            whereas the Suez Canal Company proposed to charge dues only on such
                            space if it were at any time utilized during the passage through the
                            Canal. </p>
                        <p>"My council firmly adhere to the position which they have all along taken
                            up, and they do not admit the right of the Suez Canal Com- pany to
                            charge dues on partially enclosed spaces, except in cases where they are
                            being used for cargo purposes while passing through the Suez Canal. </p>
                        <p>"If the Suez Canal Company base their right to charge these dues on the
                            International Rules as originally framed at Constantinople in 1873, my
                            council are justified in sayiny that they are now putting a different
                            interpretation on these rules from that which they have done for the
                            last 30 years. My council gannot acquiesce in such an entirely new <cb
                                n="2"/>departure, which inflicts serious hardship on many vessels
                            which have been designed and built in accordance with the practice which
                            hitherto obtained in the levying of the Suez Canal dues. . . . </p>
                        <p>"The question is a much langer one than the Suez Canal Company appear to
                            realize, and it can only be properly dealt with, in the opinion of my
                            council, by a frank interchange of views between the Suez Canal Company
                            and the shipowners. My council, therefore, still adhere to their
                            proposal that a conference should take place in London, at which all
                            interested should be represented, in order to deal with this
                            matter-which has created much dissatisfaction-and, also, with other
                            questions closely connected with the Suez Canal. </p>
                        <p>"The Suez Canal Company have, no doubt, been largely influenced by the
                            views which have been expressed by the London Committee, but my couneil
                            do not admit that the London Committee, as at present constituted, can
                            be regarded as representing the views of the shipowners of the United
                            Kingdom. </p>
                        <p>"As the result of the conferences which took place in London in 1883
                            between Monsieur de Lesseps and representative shipowners the London
                            Committee was formed as a medium of communication between the shipowners
                            of the United Kingdom and the Suez Canal Company in Paris, so that the
                            views of British shipowners might be fairly placed before the Suez Canal
                            Company and all causes of friction be removed. </p>
                        <p>"Since that time many changes have taken place in the composition of the
                            London Committee, and as vacancies have occurred these have been filled
                            up on the nomination of the remaining members of the London Com- mittee
                            without the general body of shipowners of the United Kingdom being in
                            any way consulted ....</p>
                        <p>"The result is that the London Committee have committed the shipowners of
                            the United Kingdom on two most important questions- namely, the
                            treatment of partially enclosed spaces and the reduction of the Canal
                            dues. Against their action in both these matters my council desire to
                            enter their protest. </p>
                        <p>"No British shipowner could object to such eminent shipowners as Sir
                            Thomas Sutherland, Sir James Mackay, and Mr. F. Green being members of
                            any committee representing British shipping iuterests, but if these
                            gentlemen are to act in a representative capacity, it goes without
                            saying that those whom they are sup- posed to represent should at least
                            be consulted before any important departure from their previous practice
                            is made by the Suez Canal Company. </p>
                        <p>"As regards the other members of the London Committee, I have again to
                            point out that, so far as is known to my council, three of them are not
                            now shipowners, and the fourth-though a shipowner-is one whose vessels
                            do not make use of the Suez Canal. My council, therefore, feel that the
                            time has come when the London Committee should be nominated by the
                            shipowners of the United Kingdom, whose views and interests should be
                            adequately represented at the board of the Suez Canal Company, as was
                            manifestly the intention of M. de Lesseps when the London Committee was
                            formed. </p>
                        <p>"My council will be glad if the Board of Trade can be the means of
                            bringing about the proposed conference, and they will feel obliged by
                            your furnishing the Government directors of the Suez Canal, and the Suez
                            Canal Company itself, with a copy of this letter."</p>

                    <head>GROWTH OF THE "CITY LINE."<lb/>REMARKABLE PROGRESS.<lb/>From The Liverpool
                        Journal of Commerce.</head>
                    <p>The latest development of the City Line of steamers from Birkenhead to
                        Bombay, Karachi, Colombo, and Calcutta, is the provision of saloon carriages
                        attached to the fast Great Western express from Paddington, and 42 first and
                        second-class passengers availed themselves of the new facilities in
                        connection with the departure of the City of York from Birkenhead, at
                        midnight on Tuesday. With the removal of the Lane to Liverpool, which has
                        long been contemplated, there is no reason why an Oriental boat train should
                        not be run to meet the City Line boats just as American boat trains are run
                        to meet the Atlantic liners. Passenger traffic with the East is capable of
                        great expansion ; British officers and civil servants and their families are
                        constantly travelling to and fro, and the City Line boats also touch at
                        Malta, Port Said, Suez, and Ismailia (for Egypt and the Holy Land), in the
                        season, which begins next month, when thousands of the richer classes flock
                        to warmer climates to escape the rigour of the English winter. It is the
                        more creditable to the enterprise of the City Line that, without a penny of
                        Government subsidy, they have been able to do so much, for they have built
                        up a fleet of the best, largest, and fastest passenger and cargo vessels
                        afloat, of which four, the City of Athens, City of Benares, City of
                        Manchester, and City of York, aggregating 32,856 tons, specially built for
                        the passenger traffic, have been added to the line within the last three
                        years. Each vessel has every requisite for comfort in tropical and cold
                        olimates; the saloon and state rooms are situated a midships, and are
                        lighted by electricity. The dining and smoking saloons of the City of
                        Benares are not inferior to those of first-class Atlantio liners. In the
                        matter of speed, the later and fastest addi- tion to the fleet, the City of
                        York, has reduced the voyage from Birkenhead to Caleutta from 30 days to 24
                        days 6 hours 40 minutes steaming time, being an average speed of 316} knots
                        per day, and the voyage to Calcutta has beon reduced by the City Liners on
                        an average five days. </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,–Every one interested in British trade, wealth, and welfare must
                            feel indebted to you for having raised the question of "British trade"
                            in your valuable journal, and opened your columns to a correspondence on
                            the subject, which gives us all the advantage of hearing the opinions of
                            those whose position and daily occupation enables them to give us exact
                            particulars with regard to the subject- indeed they are the only people
                            in this, or in any other country, whose opinions (on this subject) are
                            worth having.</p>
                        <p>The statements of your correspondents "Cast Steel" and "Rags" (Cairo) and
                            "Tradesman" (Alexandria) in the Gazette, are perfectly correct but do
                            not go so far as they might do–as foreign agents, although of very high
                            standing when representing foreign firms, in the same article as the
                            British firm leave no stone unturned to drive the British-made article
                            out of the market. I can quote you an instance of a foreign firm who
                            sent a traveller here to push printed lawns and fancy-colored batistes
                            (an article formerly exclusively obtained from England)and to impress
                            the shopkeepers he visited, the Cairo agent produced in support of his
                            statements against the British-made article extracts from the reports of
                            British Consuls in all parts of the world, complaining that British
                            manufacturers would not, in the case of low-class goods (as produced),
                            turn out any fancy patterns, and always stuck to their stripes and
                            squares, which are now almost unsaleable in this country alongside the
                            fancy article made on the continent for nearly the same price.
                            Furthermore, he impressed on each would-be customer that, as stated in
                            the British consular reports, British firms would not give credit, while
                            he was ready to give any conditions. He suggested 6 or 9 months, and
                            longer if desired-all he wanted was a trial order, and he only wished
                            for this in the interest of the shopkeeper's own business, as his
                            article appeared "just like silk," etc. Well, Mr. Editor, the result was
                            that he received orders in Cairo alone amounting to about 120,000 francs
                            (nearly £4,800). It is not his success that concerns me, but I must ask
                            you to inform your readers that his statements against British firms,
                            although in some cases culled from consular reports, are absolutely
                            incorrect, and are in every respect a very great injustice to British
                            firms and British workmen. I can state on the highest possible authority
                            that British manufacturers will produce any shade or pattern of any
                            article asked for and the only condition they make is that in the case
                            of a special article, not needed for the general market, a certain
                            quantity be ordered. They are most obliging and desire only to meet the
                            wishes of their customers. They will even go so far as to produce a
                            special article for any special market and will meet the price desired
                            by the customer, always giving good and honest value for the price
                            charged. With regard to credit, British manufacturers are willing and
                            able to give better conditions than are most, if not all, of the
                            Continental manufacturers. The systems are so entirely different, that
                            if the British system was known generally in this country, it would be
                            ap preciated to the extent it deserves, as it would save shopkeepers and
                            others from the danger of being declared as a bankrupt, as at present,
                            if unable to meet an accepted Bill on a certain date.</p>
                        <p>When a British firm has satisfied itself (through a Cairo bank or other
                            reliable source of information) regarding the customer, it opens a
                            current account up to a certain sum, maturing in, say, 6 months, or as
                            agreed upon, and always bringing cash to hand to the credit of the
                            oldest part of the account, and shipping goods as demanded within the
                            limit agreed to (which may be up to any sum, according to the credit or
                            transactions of the customer). Should the customer be in any particular
                            month, such as the summer months in Egypt, when money is scarce, unable
                            tosend his remittance when due, he has only to write explaining, and the
                            explanation is always accepted. In many cases he is not even charged
                            interest for the days overdue, and in every case the British firm shows
                            a desire to help its customer and to "keep him going." They never think
                            of "getting him in a tight corner." Many of the leading firms in England
                            pride themselves on the fact that not a man whose name was on their
                            books ever went bankrupt while doing business with them.</p>
                        <p>I am speaking with the highest possible authority in saying that almost
                            every man engaged in trade in Egypt or in any other country can, if he
                            so wishes, bring about being treated in the above manner by the
                            manufacturer of almost every article in which he trades, which would
                            containly save him from a lot of the worry which attends having to meet
                            "Drafts at Sight" or Bills presented for payment on certain dates. It
                            would also relieve the Mixed Tribunals of nearly all their present
                            commercial work of "protesting bills" and dealing with cases of
                            failures, brought about in many eases by a man being unable to meet a
                            bill presented for payment on a certain date with instructions to bring
                            the trader to ruin if. he can't meet the bill at time of presentation. </p>
                        <p>The Continental system is and needs to be entirely different, as the very
                            great majority of Continental firms do not command anything like the
                            wealth and facilities at the disposal of British firms and,
                            consequently, every point of the extreme difference between the two
                            systems tells against the trader, and in favour of the British but
                            against the Continental system. </p>
                        <p>In almost all cases when goods are despatched from a house on the
                            Continent, a "traite" <cb n="4"/> (or bill), payable on a certain date,
                            is immediately instituted by the sender of the goods, and at once
                            (without waiting for the accept ance of the receiver of the goods, or
                            any news of their arrival) discounted or cashed to the firm by a local
                            banker or other person in his city. This enables the manutacturer to at
                            once receive the money he needs, to pay for his raw material or the
                            wages of his workmen, although the goods representing the value of the
                            bill or "traite" may be delayed at Marseilles for months afterwards, and
                            when they do arrive, they may or may not be up to quality agreed upon.
                            But the sender has his money and cares very little. The bill, or
                            "traite," finally reaches a bank in Cairo (very often before the arrival
                            of the goods) with instructions, in case of non-payment on presentation,
                            to protest it in Mixed Tribunals and to sell ap the trader in case of
                            necessity. The feelings of the Egyptian trader can be better imagined
                            than explained, and, in many cases, to save his name from the disgrace
                            of a protest in the Mixed Tribunals, he pays the bill before the
                            receives the goods representing its value. On the other hand, even if
                            his goods did arrive without any delay, it may easily happen that the
                            trader is for the moment short of hard cash to meet the bill in full.
                            But, Sir, in full it must be paid, or go into the Mixed Courts next
                            morning (very often on the same day). So damaging is this Continental
                            system to the trader, that although only in temporary difficulties for
                            ready cash, it causes such worry that he, in some cases, neglects his
                            business and is brought to ruin; whereas, if he had been trading with
                            British houses, he could never be in such a position.</p>
                        <p>I can support every word stated above, and in conclusion have no
                            hesitation in saying that it is only British firms who really give
                            credit which is of use to the trader, and that the so-called credit
                            offered by Continental firms, only helps to bring the trader to ruin and
                            creates a lot of disagreeable work for our banks and the Mixed
                            Tribunals. I shall be glad if any of your readers can contradict one
                            word of what I have stated above, and being hard facts, I hope that the
                            newspapers published in the Arabic language will think it worth while
                            reproducing someof them for the information of the large numbers of
                            their readers who are engaged in trade.</p>

                    <p>The want of money to carry on the work of the Egyptian Exploration Fund has,
                        we are glad to see, drawn the attention of the London Press to the subject.
                        The Globe, for example, makes the following comments :- </p>
                    <p>If there is any country which should take a special interest in exploring the
                        buried trea sures of Ancient Egypt it is England. It is due to English
                        statesmanship that some of its former prosperity is coming back to the land
                        of the Pharaohs, together with the benefits of modern and Western
                        civilisation. The English people have been learning, under the guidance of
                        able European archaeologists, and with the invaluable help of the Egypt
                        Exploration Fund, to appreciate the wisdom of the men who built the
                        Pyramids, and to trace the progress achieved on the banks of the Nile
                        through the centuries that have elapsed since the days of the Exodus. And,
                        much as we have come to know already, we are doubtless on the brink of still
                        grenter discoveries, which may throw unexpected light upon our own Sacred
                        Books, and even on Primitive Christianity itself. The report presented at
                        the annual general meeting of the Fund yesterday, and the explanations
                        offered by Sir John Evans from the chair are full of instruction, and
                        warrant the highest hopes for the future. It is much to have come into
                        possession of a new volume of "Sayings of Jesus," and yet more startling
                        finds may await the continuance of well directed research. It is
                        disquieting, however, to hear that financially the great enterprise is not
                        prospering. This year's report -- the eighteenth since the Fund was
                        instituted-is the most favourable since the work was begun. The fact surely
                        requires only to be generally known to ensure a change for the better. We
                        are told that subscriptions have fallen off from America, because the
                        Americans now prefer to work for themselves ; and we have energetic rivals
                        in Europe. To maintain the proud position of England in this matter a
                        considerable expenditure is required, and yet we find that the present
                        outlay is much in excess of the income.</p>

                    <head>DRAMA IN REAL LIFE.</head>
                    <dateline>Rome, Tuesday. - </dateline>
                    <p>Every now and then in Italy there is a mysterious tragedy which would make
                        the fortune of a dramatist. Unfortunately for the public which reads, the
                        police too often fail to unravel the mystery. </p>
                    <p>A case of this kind has just happened in Bologna. The story of one of the two
                        actors, and the only living one, is that she was in bed when her husband's
                        orderly burst into the room exclaiming, "I shall kill you, and then put an
                        end to myself," and while the terrified woman was rushing from the room he
                        committed suicide. The mystery lies in the fact that he had five wounds,
                        four of which were pronounced mortal, and the question at once became, Could
                        they all have been self-inflicted ? The experts said no, so the theory was
                        advanoed that Signora Battisti had had two lovers, the orderly and another,
                        that one or the other had found her with his rival, and the tragedy had
                        ensued. So grave were the doubts, that she was arrested, and was in prison
                        for a month on suspicion, not of murder, but of complicity in man slaughter.
                        Her husband, Captain Battisti, proved a clear alibi. She has been released
                        from prison, and there the question stands,and always will, as she, the only
                        known witness, sticks to her original story.</p>
                    <p>If she is innocent, which the public seems to think, she is, indeed, a victim
                        of circumstances and the police. Her record is of the best, an affectionate
                        mother, and devoted wife, quiet and home-loving, with no friends to speak
                        of, one who lived for and in her family ; but Fate has decreed that she must
                        go through life with the stigma of "want of evidence." After all, Fate is a
                        bad dramatist. On the stage the mystery would have been lifted one way or
                        the other.</p>

                    <p>Casting about for a subject for this week's paper, I asked the Editor if he
                        could suggest one. He replied "Write about the moral needs of Alexandria." A
                        reverend gentleman present said that if I did, I should limit my remarks to
                        the office of the Egyptian Gazette. Now this would be cruel on my part,
                        seeing that my last week's paper was on religion, and that next week I
                        intend to deal with a very important matter connected with morality, on
                        which I am awaiting fuller information than I at present possess. </p>
                    <p>The cost of living in Egypt has been the subject of much correspondence in
                        the Gazette during the last few months. To a comparatively new comer the
                        question is one of great importance, and in a case where the income is
                        limited, especially so. From personal experience 1 have not found that the
                        cost of living is so greatly in excess of what it was in London,-indeed, on
                        the average, taking the many things that are cheaper here as against those
                        that are dearer, there does not seem to be much difference in the long run.
                        A great deal depends upon how you go to market-and where-and above. all
                        whether you do the buying yourself or leave it to others to do for you. </p>
                    <p>To prove this I should have to go into details unsuited to this column. But I
                        am quite prepared to substantiate my statements and cannot at all agree with
                        the correspondent who asserted last week that to equalise matters an income
                        three times the amount necessary in England is required in Egypt. 50 per
                        cent more would, I think, be all that is necessary to enable one to live in
                        the same degree of comfort here as in England, while the advantages in the
                        way of climate, opportunity for study of Egyptian manners and customs, as
                        well as the many objects of interest in this wondertul country, are
                        certainly worth some consideration.</p>
                    <p>Much depends upon the spirit in which one comes to Egypt and the exercise of,
                        to say the least, an impartial and open-to-conviction frame of mind. Too
                        many people just come to Egypt for the sole purpose of making money and
                        getting out of it again as soon as they have effected that purpose. They
                        express by word and action the greatest contempt for the Arab, quite failing
                        to recognise that this is not their country and that as strangers in a
                        foreigu land courtesy and cousideration should be shown to the native. If
                        there is one thing more than another that has impressed itself upon both my
                        wife and myself, it is the dignitied bearing of the Arab, and it is a matter
                        of every-day remark with us how favourably in the grace of his movements he
                        contrasts with the European. Despite the centuries of oppression that have,

                        he is-and, indeed the whole nation to be wanting in the powers to govern
                        themselves (may this power soon come to them!), thereis abundant evidence of
                        a nobility of character that only needs encouragement to bring out those
                        qualities that are always associated with true nobility. </p>
                    <p>And despite my want of knowledge of Arabic, and my consequent inability to
                        converse with Arabs, I experience no other feeling than that of pleasure
                        when in their company. If quick-tempered they are invariably good-tempered
                        when nothing is done to arouse ill-feeling, while their fondness for
                        children and anxiety to prevent their running into any sort of danger, is
                        very noticeable. But the Arab is very intuitive, and is quite capable of
                        repaying scorn with scorn, mistrust with mistrust, dislike with dislike. </p>
                    <p>England has not yet succeeded in winning the affection of the Arabs. Nor will
                        she do so if Englishmen persist in assuming an attitude of superiority over
                        the natives. The Arab nature is just the one to appreciate kindness, and if
                        judicial advice in the management of affairs of state is only accompanied by
                        philanthropic effort on the part of the many English men and women who have
                        plenty of spare time on their hands in which to do really useful and
                        interesting work, a great step will have been taken towards the object many
                        have at heart,-the upliftment, social and moral, of the Egyptian people.</p>
                    <p>It would be quite a mistake to suppose that any great and organised movement
                        is necessary in order to achieve this object. It is in little things that
                        great things have their origin. Life is made up.of little things, -far more
                        so than many people imagine. As the straw will show from which quarter the
                        wind is blowing, and as the feather will show which way the water is
                        flowing, so the most trivial action will show the spirit by which it is
                        animated. It is, I know, a very difficult matter to overcome prejudices,
                        especially deeply- rooted and long-standing ones, but if the effort is made
                        and racialones can be surmounted, the result will show how desirable an end
                        has been accomplished. </p>
                    <p>This matter is one on which individual effort is more wanted than a
                        collective one, which would perhaps give as a result great cry and little
                        wool. When personal observation has been brought to bear and needs are seen
                        which collective action can supply (and such needs would soon be found 1)
                        then I do not for a moment imagine that Lord and Lady Cromer would hesitate
                        at once to place themselves at the head of a movement designed to cope with
                        existing evils and to bring about necessary social reforms.</p>

                    <head>MAHMOUDIEH CANAL.<lb/>INCREASE OF TRAFFIC.</head>
                    <p>The British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt have received some statistics of the
                        boat traffic on the Mahmoudieh Canal, which entirely justify the
                        expectations of those who advocated the abolition of the lock and bridge
                        tolls, with a view to facilitating navigation and increasing trade. </p>
                    <p>From the figures received we observe that during the three years preceding
                        the removal of tolls (1898, 1899, and 1900), between two and three thousand
                        boats passed Atfeh lock from each direction annually ; in the first year
                        after the abolition of the tolls, the figure sprang from two thousand to
                        eight thousand from each direction, and the increase has continued, till in
                        1903 the total number of boats that passed Atfeh lock was 23,099, against
                        4,564 in 1900, the last year that the tolls were in force. </p>
                    <p>At Kafr Dawar lock the total of 13,724 in 1900 has arisen to 35,732 in 1903. </p>
                    <p>There has also been a steady increase in the traffic between the Mahmoudieh
                        Canal and the sea for the last three years, since the swingbridges in the
                        neighbourhood of Minet-el- Bassal have been put into good order. Previous to
                        1901 these bridges had fallen into such a bad state of repair that they
                        could not be opened, and all direct communication between sea and canal was
                        stopped. In 1903, 2,885 vessels passed from the canal to the sea, and 4,546
                        in the opposite direction. Of these, 29 were steamers, 1,149 were large
                        sailing boats, 79 were smaller boats, and 6,127 were lighters and barges;
                        the remainder consisting of pumps, dahabiehs, lighters, etc.</p>
                    <p>The water transport would be of far greater use and value if suitable
                        provision could be made for disembarking goods at Cairo. At present the
                        carrying trade of the sailing vessels is severely handicapped by the
                        complete absence of accommodation, especially at those seasons of the year
                        when the river is low and the banks soft and muddy, and it becomes almost
                        impossible to lift heavy weights to the level of the road till the soil has
                        dried. The effect of this disadvantage is to throw a consi- derable portion
                        of the trade into the hands of the steamboat companies, who possess their
                        own landing-stages. The freight charges on the sailing boats are lower than
                        on the steamers, and with a good landing-stage at Embabeh the former would
                        probably do a greatly increased business. </p>

                        grippe with which I have been aftlicted for four months past, I have been
                        induced to undergo a treatment with this justly celebrated formula. I feel a
                        decided change for the better atter using it only one week. It is especially
                        good in toning up the stomach and has had a decided effect upon my appetite.
                        I therefore feel much encouraged that I am on the road to complete
                        restoration. </p>
                    <p>"My numerous friends in Taxas, where I have had the honor to command a
                        brigade ot her Veteran Cavalry In a four years' war, may accept this
                        voluntary testimonial to the merits of Peruna as a sense of obligation on my
                        part for its wonderful efflcacy." --- W. H. Parsons.</p>
                    <p>There is no remedy in the world that meets the conditions produced by la
                        grippe better than the remedy, Peruna. Peruna strengthens as it renovates,
                        soothes while it stimulates, heals as it expurgates. Peruna is not a
                        purgavtive, or cathartic, or sedative, or stimulant, nor a vegetable or
                        mineral poison. It reaches the source of all diseases of the mucous
                        membranes by its action on the vasd-motor system of nerves. </p>
                    <p>Every person who has had la grippe during the last year should takce s course
                        of Peruns. No one need expect perfect recovery unless they do so. The grippe
                        has produced catarrhal inflammation of the whole mucous membrane, and good
                        health is impossible until these are restored to a normal condition. This
                        Peruns will do. A great many remedies have been suggested for this condition
                        from time to time, bat Peruna appears to be the only remedy that bue any
                        substantial value in these cases. It has never failed to give satisfaction
                        during forty years' experience and still occupies the unique position of
                        buing the leading (if not the only ) specific remedy for the after-effects
                        of la grippe. </p>

                        Henry Distin Manufacturing Co., writes the following from 1441 South Ninth
                        street, Philadelphia, Pa .: </p>
                    <p>"I had a bad attack of la grippe last December which lasted more than three
                        months, and which left me with catarrh, and several of my friends advised me
                        to try Peruna. I began with a bottle the first week in March and it
                        certainly did me a great deal of good. I was so well atisfled that I
                        purchased another bottle and followed the directions, and can say that it
                        has cured me."-Henry Distin. </p>
                    <p>If you do not derive prompt and satisfactory results from the use of Peruna,
                        write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full statement of your case and he
                        will be pleased to give you his valuable advice gratis. </p>

                    <p>Ou encore : De l'opprobre garde mon cœur et qu'un beau renom je mérite sont
                        des inversions qui blessent l'oreill. autant que les regles de la
                        vereification. </p>
                    <p>O Paris aux cheveux d'or, Ah ! que n'es-tu pas encore Bouvier de génisses

                        quatre derniers vers ne sont que de la mauvaise prose rimee. Il suffit de
                        les lire avec un peu d'attention pour s'en spercevoir. </p>
                    <p>Malgre ces fautes de presodie et d'autres analogues, qui fourmillent dans
                        l'œuvre, on y trouve par ci par la de beaux vers et de belles strophes, des
                        vers qu'on croirait écrits par un de nos grands poètes classiques.</p>

                    <p>M. Silvain a d'ailleurs merveilleusement interprete le role d'Agamemnon, en 8
                        conformant aux donnees de l'histoire. L'Ipbigenie de Mme Silvain a été admi-
                        rable. La scène où elle se livre en Bacrifice. pour la Grece a ete sublime.
                        La voix un peu dure de Mile Marbeau ne sieyait ps trop mal à son rôle de
                        Clytemnestre. Mliee Belval et Barat ont e:e charmantes dans le debit de
                        leurs strophes. M. Jean Renaud B'est efforee d'etre bouillant dans Achill
                        mais il y a reussi avec peine. M Leon Morgan, par exemple, a ete tout à fait
                        manque dans son rôle de vieillard. Il n'en avait ni le geste ni la voix. </p>
                    <p>L'auditoire, moins nombreux que de coutume, n'a pas été moins enthousiaste et
                        cela se conçoit, car l'art du diseur effaçait les fautes du pcète.</p>

                    <dateline>LONDON, November 18.</dateline>
                    <p>Once more a fog has shut itself down on London, and unfortunate workers have
                        been compelled to switch on the electric light at ten on a November morning.
                        For three days this week. London has been wearing this gar ment of
                        unrighteousness, and Londoners have been groaning in a darkness positively
                        Egyptian. All the time-to add insult to injury -- the glass has been
                        obstinately high, and any people who have been able to get even a little way
                        out of town and on to higher ground have found sunshine outside the shadow
                        in which we have been groping our metropolitan way. </p>
                    <p>In some ways I cannot be sorry that Don Carlos saw London yesterday through
                        the medium of one of its own particular fogs. It is not very likely that our
                        Royal visitor is familiar with Kingsley's praise of "the hard grey weather,"
                        but the actuality of the thing must have suggested the same .reflection to
                        so acute a mind as his, as it did to the famous champion of muscular
                        Christianity. Dom Carlos has seen the capital of his ancient ally as it
                        really is during a great part of the winter months, and he will no doubt be
                        led thereby to reflect on that most curious and interesting subject-the
                        effect of climate upon the characteristics of a race. </p>
                    <p>The evidence taken before the Board of Trade Commissioners at Hull is rapidly
                        disposing of the assertion that any foreign craft was present in the
                        neighbourhood of the trawling fleet when Admiral Rozdjestvensky's gunners
                        opened fire. If there is to be a Russian case at all, it must rest on
                        establishing the possibility of a reasonable mistake with regard to the
                        character of the vessels attacked upon the fateful night of October 21. </p>
                    <p>Those who are never tired of declaring that the Colonies are hanging back on
                        the question of Fiscal Reform may be asked to explain the great meeting
                        which was held yesterday at Melbourne to advance preferential arrangements
                        with the Mother Country. Resolutions asking Parliament and the Government to
                        take the subjeet into immediate consideration were carried, after free and
                        open discussion, by large majorities, and the speakers included not only men
                        of high position in the commercial world, but politicians of differing views
                        upon other debated questions.</p>
                    <p>While it is highly satisfactory from the standpoint of British shipping
                        interests that the Atlantic freight war has come to an end, the restoration
                        of peace brings with it a serious drawback. Owing to the severe cutting of
                        passenger fares during the continuance of hostilities, our indigent alien
                        immigrants were able to pay the reduced rates, and so we had the pleasure of
                        bidding adieu to a largely increased number. That source of relief to the
                        British toiler will now cease operation, and unless some sort of barring out
                        method be applied, it is certain that this too hospitable country will again
                        become the chief reservoir for Continental paupers. </p>
                    <p>It is all to the good that there should be such a demand for the German
                        translation of Mr. Balfour's address to the British Association that a
                        second edition has become necessary. It may aid in convincing the Germans
                        that thought is not so dead in this country as some of them are accustomed
                        to assume, and that even Philosophy may find as fair a home in Cambridge as
                        in the classic groves of Weissnichtwo. </p>
                    <p>The last issue of the London Gazette happily supplies evidence that the
                        Foreign Office is not impervious to well-grounded remonstrances. For a long
                        time past, the press has considered it a patriotie obligation to point out
                        the vital importance of materially strengthening the British Consulate in
                        Persia. Russia had been systematically employing that method to increase her
                        political influence both af Teheran and in the provinces, but Downing-street
                        remained supine, as if Great Britain had no particular interest in
                        counteracting the subtle manœuvre. Now, however, the Gazette has announced
                        the appointment of six additional Consular officers, including one
                        Consul-General, three Consuls, and two Vice-Consuls. As an instalment of
                        still better things to come, I heartily welcome this new departure in
                        proportioning means to purposes. On Tuesday the Progressives in the London
                        County Council revived their old scheme for <cb n="2"/>a tramway along the
                        Embankment to connect ; the systems which terminate at present at the
                        southern ends of Blackfriars and Westminster Bridges. By seventy-five votes
                        to twenty-seven, the Council decided to promote a Bill for this purpose in
                        Parliament next Session, and in the meantine the unfortunate ratepayers can
                        only wait and hope that the House of Commons, when it meets, will be found
                        in a more reasonable and economical frame of mind than the Council. It is
                        perfectly true that on the Embankment itself a tramway would disorganise the
                        traffic less than in most of our streets, but it would utterly spoil the
                        appearance of that great monument of Victorian engineering, and the
                        confusion which would be created by carrying the lines over the bridges
                        would be almost incalculable. </p>
                    <p>From a journalistic point of view, the new proprietors of the Standard have
                        made an excellent selection in their new editor. Mr. H. A. Gwynne has won
                        his reputation as a special correspondent in many lands for Reuter's Agency,
                        and in the Turco-Greek war and the South African campaign did some notable
                        work. His qualities as a political director of a party organ are yet to be
                        discovered, but Mr. Gwynne is by this time well accustomed to the feat of
                        adapting himself to his surroundings. I am pleased to see that Mr. Sidney
                        Low remains as literary editor of the paper, as well as one of its
                        leader-writers, and I welcome the retention of Mr. S. H. Jeyes' services as
                        assistant editor as a just recognition of his valuable services to the
                        Standard. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Alfred Beit and Mr. Wernher have followed in the footsteps of Cecil
                        Rhodes, in becoming benefactors to the ancient University of Oxford. In
                        addition to finding the money for Professorship of Colonial History, Messrs.
                        Beit and Wernher will also, it is understood, offer a prize in connection
                        with this subject, and give a donation to the Bodleian Library. In order
                        that the new Professor may not be overworked, the princely benefactors have
                        arranged for the appointment of a Sub-Professor. The Rhodes Trustees, it may
                        be mentioned, are to add £200 a year for the next five years to the stipend
                        of the Reader in Pathology.</p>
                    <p>Once again that semi-sacred institution, the Little-Go, is to be thrown into
                        the melting pot at Cambridge, for the syndicate which was appointed a year
                        ago has just issued its report, and proposes certain radical changes. Itis
                        suggested that the examination should be divided into three parts, which
                        need not be taken all at once, though all are compulsory. The first part is
                        to consist of languages, ancient and modern. Candidates must take two
                        languages, one of which must be either Latin or Greek, while the other may
                        be either French or German ; but, says the syndicate with grim humour, there
                        will be "no temptation to choose the examination in a modern language as
                        being the easier course." This means that Greek is to be no longer
                        compulsory. </p>
                    <p>The report that "General" Booth, the head of the Salvation Army, is about to
                        purchase the island of Anticosti from M. Henri Menier, the Parisian
                        chocolate manufacturer, directs the world's attention to one of the most
                        extraordinary real estate transactions of modern times. Ten years ago, says
                        the New York Tribune, M. Menier purchased Anticosti for 8150,000, and sought
                        to make himself monarch of all he surveyed. Now he has tired of the scheme,
                        which, moreover, did not work satisfactorily, and although he spent nearly
                        82,000,000 improving this remarkable estate, it is believed that he has sold
                        out, or is about to sell out, to "General" Booth for a fraction of that sum,
                        and that the Salvationists will soon begin to colonise it on a large scale,
                        which he could not succeed in doing. </p>
                    <p>The rush of new applications for membership of the Stock Exchange has been
                        unparallelled. As the constitution of the House is being radically altered,
                        and it will not be possible henceforward for persons to become members-apart
                        from clerks of whom a limited number may be admitted annually at the
                        discretion of the committee- it was only natural that as many as aspired to
                        membership and held the requisite qualifications should hurry to anticipate
                        the new rules. As many as 666 names have been put up, this total easily
                        beating the previous record of 477 to 1900-1. Of. the aggregate 550 are
                        clerks, who will pay 220 guineas' entrance fee, and 116 are "three- deckers"
                        who will pay 500 guineas. From entrance fees alone the funds of the Stock
                        Exchange will be increased by £205,275, while one year's subscription of 40
                        guineas will bring in $27,972 more.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>Evidently the Alake of Abeokuta has absorbed one idea-that of how to keep
                        Christmas-from his recent visit to this country. Twenty.five cases of plum
                        puddings is the sort of order that fairly takes one's breath away, and
                        suggests that the excellent and progressive raler intends to give his Court
                        such a Christmas as it never yet beheld. As his ménage is conducted on the
                        most rigid temperance lines, the mitigating brandy will be absent, and as
                        the plum puddings are to be followed by enormous quantities of crystallised
                        sweets, I can foresee a rather lively Boxing Day for the upper circles in
                        Abeokuta. It is possible to be too English. </p>
                    <p>A Free, but far from United, church is that at Dalkeith. Two rival clergymen
                        started to preach simultaneously on Sunday. The rector declared he bad had
                        to come. in through the window, while one of his flock retorted that he was
                        in danger of going out that way. He was prevented reading the legal
                        authorisation for his position by the harmonium being in the hands of the
                        Opposition, and played fortissimo with all the couplers on. Eventually three
                        prize fighting, worshippers entered the pulpit, and procured peace and
                        decorum by threatening the life of their spiritual pastor and master. </p>
                    <p>A lamentable crisis has befallen the Earlswood Asylum, which makes provision
                        for the' imbecile and the mentally deficient. As a result of the discovery
                        that for 50 years the building had been standing without foundations, and on
                        a clay soil, too, an immediate outlay of £30,000 was necessary to prevent
                        actual collapse. </p>
