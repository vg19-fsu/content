                        <p>Yesterday's heat was tempered in the afternoon by a fresh N.W. breeze,
                            which increased in velocity at night. The day opens with a moderate
                            breeze and a falling barometer. </p>

                    <head>PRESS IN WAR TIME </head>
                    <p>The question of the Press in time of war has now passed into its penultimate
                        stage.The Prime Minister has taken it under his official wing and, lhas
                        placed it upon the list of Government measures with which he hopes to deal
                        next year. That is a decision (says the "Morning Post") upon which both the
                        Press and the Government are to be congratulated the Press for voluntarily
                        raising the question and in a sense asking to be restrained generally where
                        restraint is essential to the national interest and the Government for
                        taking the matter up in a straightforward and effective fashion. Mr. Arthur
                        Lee, who as an ex Army officer, our Military Attache at Washington during
                        the Spanish American War, and a Civil Lord of the Admiralty under the late
                        Government, probably knows the ins and outs of the subject as well as any
                        man in the House recently asked the Prime Minister whether his attention had
                        been called to the recent conference of newspaper proprietors and editors,
                        "at which there was a unanimous expression of opinion in favor of
                        restricting or controlling the dissemination of news in time of war," and
                        what action he proposed to take in consequence. The Prime Minister answered
                        that the matter was being considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence
                        and that he hoped to bring in a Bill dealing with it early next year. Mr.
                        Lee very properly asked whether the Bill might not be introduced this
                        session so that the Press might have an opportunity of studying its
                        provisions at leisure. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman replied that there were
                        means of communicating with the Press other than by introducing a Bill in
                        the House. We take this to me that nothing in the way of hasty legislation
                        is contemplated sad that the Press will either be consulted during the
                        period of drafting the Bill or that the Bill when completed will be referred
                        to the Press for criticism and suggestions. In either case the Government is
                        plainly prepared to collaborate with the Press in the work of formulating a
                        measures that will secure the maximum of safety to the State with the
                        minimum of interference with legitimate journalistic activities. It was for
                        this purpose that the Conference of June 21 authorised the Sub-Committee of
                        the Newspaper Society to add to its numbers men with special knowledge of
                        the points at issue and to consider any Bill that might be drafted. The
                        Government need not hesitate to treat the enlarged Sub-Committee as fully
                        representative of the Press as a whole. We would suggest that the right
                        course to take is for the Government to draft the sort of Bill it would like
                        to passed, and for the Sub Committee of the Newspaper society to bring its
                        provisions as far as possible into harmony with the opinions expressed at
                        the recent conference, and, if necessary to call a further conference. The
                        resultant would probably be a measure prohibiting in time of war and when
                        war is imminent the unauthorized publications as news of naval and military
                        movements. If there were incorporated in such a measure the guarantee which
                        the Committee of Imperial Defence but already informally offered-guarantee,
                        for instances that it would only be invoked in the event of an imminent war
                        with a first class Power, that it would come to operate automatically on the
                        conclusion of peace, and that its administration would be in civil hands-the
                        Press would, we believe, be found ready to accept it. In the long run the
                        three interests of journalism and the true interests of the nation must be
                        identical. The Press cannot gain where the nation loses, and that the nation
                        s tands to lose heavily by the unrestricted publication of news in time of
                        war is very evident. Journalists desire to relieve their profession from its
                        liability to become at any moment a source of peril to the country.</p>

                        <p>A terrible story is published by a Cairo contemporary which shows that
                            Egypt can boast some imported savages in every way equal to the
                            Manoufiah product. It is stated that a Greek servant girl who had been
                            employed for several years at the house of one Ch. Callicopoulo, a Cairo
                            bootmaker, was recently accused by her master of the theft of money and
                            jewels. To extort a confession her scoundrelly employer beat the girl
                            most cruelly, kicked her, poured boiling oil over her hands and wrists,
                            and finally tied her up and tortured her by applying boiling eggs to the
                            armpits! These last tortures inflicted such excruciating pain that the
                            poor girl died of the shock. The Greek Consulate has ordered Dr. Lambros
                            to enquire into the affair and has refused to listen to certain medical
                            evidence obtained by Callicopoulo, who will be tried here before M.
                            Scotidie. We are informed by the Greek Consulate that the name of the
                            victim is Dandris. She died after three days of agony. A warrant has
                            been issued for the arrest of Callicopoulo, who will be tried at the
                            Criminal Assinas at Alexandria in December. M. Vernitki Hellenic, Vice
                            Colonel, is investigating the case. The sum alleged to have been stolen
                            is 300 pounds, and it is said that the loss of it turned the brain of
                            Callicopoulos, who is well known among the Hellenic colony of Cairo.

                        <p>Those who are best able to judge Egypt's needs as a result of many years'
                            experience of the country strongly deprecate the remarks which have been
                            made by certain irresponsible individuals in the House of Commons during
                            the last few days in connection with the verdict in the Danishwi affair.
                            The utterances are looked upon as mere Little Englandiam and as having
                            the savour of a desire for self-notoriety. </p>
                        <p>It is sincerely hoped by all who have the real welfare of Egypt at heart
                            that the public at home will not be led away by the excessive deal of
                            persons who are simply desirous of making political capital out of this
                            unfortunate incident. </p>
                        <p>As an instance of how little the customs of the country are understood
                            here, the wailing of the women at the time of the execution has been
                            made much of and has produced a great effect on the feelings of
                            individuals who are unaware that it is the custom for this to occur in
                            all cases of death, and had no other significance at Denishwai. </p>
                        <p>I learn that the action of the Egyptian authorities has met with the
                            entire approval of both the Europeans and the educated natives as being
                            absolutely necessary to check any undue lawlessness and brutality on the
                            part of the lower class of natives, who are not yet sufficiently
                            advanced in the path of civilisation to appreciate unjust leniency. </p>
                        <p>It is considered to be most unlikely that the home Government will
                            interfere in the matter. </p>

                        <p>In the House of Commons last Wednesday, Mr. Dillon asked the Prime
                            Minister, in the absence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
                            whether he had been made aware of the fact that that morning four
                            Egyptians were sentenced to death by the special court in connexion with
                            the unfortunate affair at Denishwai, and whether he could undertake to
                            obtain a respite of the sentence until the Foreign Minister had had an
                            opportunity of personally examining the evidence given betro the
                            tribunal. </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister: I have not heard anything of the circumstance
                            referred to by the hon. member, but I am sure we can trust to the
                            discretion and humanity of my right hon. friend the Foreign Secretary
                            (Sir Edward Grey) to see that everything is done that may be necessary.
                            (Cheers.) </p>
                        <p>On the following day, Mr. Dillon asked the Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, whether he had yet received any detailed information as to the
                            aircumstarces which led to the affray: whether any of the natives were
                            killed or injured; if any natives were killed or injured, would the
                            British officers who took part in the affray be tried; whether the
                            pigeons shot on these occasions were tame or wild pigeons ; whether
                            occasions were tame or wild pigeons ; whether pigeon shooting in the
                            neighbourhood of villages was a legal occupation in Egypt; whether in
                            this instance the permission of the headman of the village had been
                            obtained by the officers before they commenced to shoot ; what were the
                            special grounds on which the Agent and Consul of Great Britain demanded
                            that the accused Egyptians in this case should be sent for trial before
                            the Special Tribunal; and whether there was any appeal from the Special
                            Tribunal before which the Egyptians were to be tried. </p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey.--I cannot answer all the details of the hon. member's
                            question. I do not know whether any native was killed or injured, but
                            our information is that the British officers, when they were attacked by
                            the natives, gave up their guns and refused to fire in self-defence
                            (hear, hear), and if any natives were killed, it was clearly not by the
                            action of the British officers. When the report appeared in the Press
                            yesterday, I telegraphed to know what the sentences were, and what were
                            the facts established at the trial, saying that it was desirable we
                            should know them before any death sentences were executed. The
                            information I have received is as follows -The sentences were as stated
                            in the Press, except that, I think, only two men were sentenced to penal
                            servitude for life, whereas the Press stated four. With regard to the
                            trial, the prisoners were defended by three of the best-known native
                            advocates, who had a full hearing. The Court was unanimous as regards
                            the prisoners found guilty, and the evidence clearly established
                            premeditation and concerted actions. Thirty one of the prisoners were
                            acquitted and 21 were found guilty. The Court expressed its opinion that
                            the British officers had behaved with extreme forbearance and
                            self-restraint. (Hcar, hear.) The chief attack took place after they had
                            given up their guns and was persisted in with great brutality. I am also
                            informed that, in the opinion of Judge Bond and Mr. Hayter, the Acting
                            Judicial Adviser, both members of the Court, the first six prisoners
                            would undoubtedly have been found guilty of murder by a British jury.
                            The Special Court was composed of the Egyptian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, who has had several years' experience in the Ministry of
                            Justice in the absence of the latter ; Mr. Bond, Vice-President of the
                            Native Court of Appeal, whose position is practically that of Dord Chief
                            Justice ; Fethy Bey, President of the Cairo Native Court; Mr. Hayter,
                            Action Judicial Adviser, formerly a Judge in the Sudan, and Colonel
                            Ludlew, Officiating Judge Advocate. </p>
                        <p>There is no legal power of interference on the part either of the
                            Egyptian Government or of the British Agency with the execution of the
                            decision of the Court, and I am confident that the character of the
                            tribunal is the greatest safeguard possible against a miscarriage of
                            justice. (Cheers).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dillon said the right hon. gentleman had not said whether it was
                            legal or illegal to shoot there pignora in native villages, whether they
                            were the property of the villagers, and whether a native woman wounded
                            or killed before the officers were attacked.</p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey-I understand that no one was wounded or killed before the
                            officers were attacked, but that, after the guns had been given up by
                            the officers, one of the guns was let off and caused injury to, I think,
                            four people including one woman. But that was not by the officers.
                            (Hear, hear) With regard to pigeon shooting. I understand that pigeons
                            are never to be shot exempt with the consent of the headman of the
                            village. In this case the officers arrived in the carriage of the local
                            magnate and assumed that a completo understanding had taken place. As to
                            the future, it is quite clear that, after each a serious incident as
                            this, there should be no more pigeon shooting (hear, hear), and I
                            understand that instructions were given some time so that it should
                            cease.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Paul asked the right hon. gentleman whether he would consider the
                            possibility of procuring through Lord Cromer the reminion of the
                            floggings that formed part of the sentences in this case (Cries of "Why
                            !")</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bylos asked the right hon. gentleman whether he had any information
                            as to whether the persone sentenced to death had been executed, and, if
                            not, whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it was imponible yet
                            to save their lives (cries of "Oh"), inarmach as the nature of the
                            fracas did not indicate murder in the sense in which we in England
                            understood it. (Renewed cries of "Oh.")</p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey-I have not actually heard whether the death sentences have
                            been carried out, but they were to be executed at 2 o'clock this
                            afternoon according to Egyptian time. I assume, therefore, that that has
                            already taken place. With regard to the character of the crime, two of
                            the Judges were men with English knowledge as well as experience in
                            Egyptian law, and they stated that, in their opinion, not only four but
                            six of the natives would have been convicted of murder by a British
                            jury. I understand that the sentence of flogging were to be executed
                            immediately: but, with regard to the general question, I quite
                            sympathise with my hon.friend's feeling. which is shared by a large
                            number of people,to the desirability of watching sentences of the kind
                            very closely. I do not know the extent to which flogging is possible
                            under Egyptian law, but I propose to take the opportunity of discussing
                            that when Lord Cromar is in England, with a view to knowing to what
                            extent it is possible and whether any change is desirable. </p>

                        <head>LIBERAL FEELING IN PARLIAMENT </head>
                        <p>In a note on Sir E. Grey's statement the Lobby correspondent of the
                            "Tribune" says: The fuller details given by Sir Edward Grey have
                            distinctly modified, if they have not entirely removed, the feeling of
                            uneasiness felt by some Liberals as to the possibility of a miscarriage
                            of justice. The Foreign Secretary assurance and Lord Cromer's statement
                            that the tribunal was thoroughly competent, and that the natives were
                            adequately represented, have given much satisfaction. At the same time,
                            a feeling still exists among a certain number of Liberals that
                            premeditation does not appear to be clearly proved, and that the
                            prerogative of mercy might have been exercised. It may be said, however,
                            that such objections are not raised by many members besides those who
                            interviewed the Foreign Secretary on Wednesday,and that the anxiety
                            caused by the perusal of a very brief report has, on the whole, been
                            allayed. </p>

                        "Nadwat al Assal '' has appeared early this season; particularly on cotton
                        cultivated on light sandy soils. </p>
                    <p>It should be clearly understood that the green Aphia found at present on the
                        leaves of cotton, and its liquid product known as "Nadwat al Assal," which
                        will appear later, are one and the same. </p>
                    <p>At the present stage, this post, by careful attention to the following
                        instructions, may be easily and economically stamped out. </p>
                    <p>The small areas of cotton infected by this pest are usually more or low in
                        the form of a circle on the outer fringe of the cotton field; but a few
                        infected plants are occasionally found inside cotton areas near the main
                        water channels, or in close proximity to water melons cucumbers, and other
                        plants of the melon family growing in the cotton. </p>
                    <p>At the present stage of the attack a certain number of leaves only are
                        infected. If all infected foliage is at once picked and destroyed (a work
                        which can be easily and economically carried out everywhere) no danger, or
                        loss of crop is likely to occur. </p>
                    <p>The cotton plants with clean stems and terminal buds, if now freed from the
                        Aphis, will, by this additional assistance to ripening their wood quickly
                        break into strong healthy foliage and flowers, capable of carrying a full
                        crop of lint.</p>
                    <p>All leaves on infected plants should be at once picked and burned, commencing
                        on the outside of the infected area and working inwards until the clean
                        stems and terminal buds only remain. </p>
                    <p>All infected leaves should be carefully hand picked by children with a little
                        shaking as possible and the aphie covered foliage collected in tin vessels
                        of any kind, such as petroleum tins, pails, tin mugs or any other available
                        vessels, in which they should be carried to the fire and burned, each vessel
                        being afterwards washed or scoured with sand or earth to clean it from any
                        aphis crawling on the sides, and, on the completion of the work, the earth
                        round the bare stem (from which the leaves have been picked) should be dug
                        up and broken fine, to destroy aphis that have fallen during the picking. </p>
                    <p>On no account should persons employed in destroying "Nedwet El Amal" be
                        allowed to enter clean cotton-for the danger of infection by aphis carried
                        on clothing is a point requiring serious attention. The present practice of
                        placing infected leaves in gallabia or in baskets is strongly condemned,
                        owing to the extreme danger of extending infection to clean cotton plants. </p>
                    <p>All infected areas must on the completion of the work be carefully inspected
                        by a responsible person, why must be sure that no infected leaves remain,
                        and, as an extra precaution against carrying infection, gallabias should be
                        beaten in order to rid them of any aphis clinging to them.</p>
                    <p>When the sticky fluid known as Nedwet El Assal appears on all parts of the
                        plants, the success of hand picking infected foliage is considerably
                        diminished.</p>
                    <p>If these simple instructions are carefully adhered to, there is every hope
                        that the pest may be successfully stamped out, and a serious loss to the
                        coming season's cotton crop averted.</p>
                    <p>Whenever "sprayers' ' are forthcoming these should be used freely, as
                        prescribed by circular of last year.</p>

                        the talented company of artistes now occupying the boards of the above
                        theatre, and although this evergreen favourite has been produced on several
                        previous occasions the popularity of the opera was evinced by the crowded

                    <p>The first set of the opera lacked vitality at the commencement, and this was
                        doubtless due to the very depressing tempo at which some of the numbers were

                    <p>American Futures.--The market this week has again been under the same
                        influences as last week, namely a renewed liquidation of the July position
                        coupled with great deal of manipulation, and of straddle operations, (buying
                        in New York, and selling in this market). Prices have fluctuated daily ; the
                        net result, however, shows practically very little change from those of last
                        Thursday. There is no particular feature beyond the absolute absence of any
                        speculative interest from any side, and the general impression that the crop
                        as a whole has made good progress during the present month has no doubt
                        largely tended to induce the liquidation of the "Bull" interests. Attention
                        will now be directed to the next Bureau report which it is generally
                        anticipated will be favourable.</p>

                    <p>The home press in the main expresses cordial approval of the finding of the
                        special tribunal which considered the case of the natives involved in the
                        outrage on British officers at Denishwai, and the punishment meted out to
                        them, though certain of the Liberal journals consider the sentences rather
                        too drastic, a view that is entirely out of harmony with the facts contained
                        in the evidence placed before the court. We append a few excerpts: </p>
                    <div type="item">
                        <head>"TIMES"</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian authorities have to deal not only with a brutal and
                            unprovoked murder, but with a revolt upon a small scale on the part of
                            the lowest and most fanatical of the Mussulman population. That is a
                            thing which must be put down at all costs, and the more vigorously
                            because our army of occupa is very small, and would speedily have its
                            hands full all over the country if the nation got abroad that fanatical
                            outrages can be perpetrated with impunity. The ring-leaders in this case
                            have been amply identified not only by the British officers attacked,
                            but by native witnesses. The severe sentences passed upon them are not
                            only justified, but imperatively demanded, by the circumstances. So long
                            as we remain responsible for the government of Egypt we have to make our
                            authority respected, and must suppress outbreaks of fanaticism, however
                            prompted, with unsparing rigour. </p>

                        <head>"TELEGRAPH"</head>
                        <p>The prisoners had an absolutely fair trial, were allowed counsel, and had
                            on the bench native representatives of the Egyptian Government. The
                            defence, though in able hands, was extremely lame, and rather directed
                            to disclaim premeditation than to exonerate the murderer. There is a
                            curious theory amongst philanthropic Radicals that it is harsh to punish
                            many people for a single crime; "one murder," they say in effect, "one
                            convict." If there are any mitigating circumstances in the case of which
                            the British public is ignorant the decision may safely be left in the
                            hands of the Egyptian Government. Lord Cromer is at present on his way
                            home, but his policy of fairness and determination to protect the
                            interests and rights of the fellaheen suffers no diminution in his
                            absence. </p>

                        <p>The outrage and the severity of the sentences are unique in the history
                            of the British Occupation. It was shown in court to the satisfaction, we
                            are glad to say, of native as well as English judges that the
                            unoffending victims were deliberately enticed to the scene of the
                            outrage and that the murderous fanatical attack was carefully
                            premeditated Apparently had it not been for Captain Bostock's successful
                            warning of the Mounted Infantry patrol several miles distant, and the
                            friendly attitude of some of the village headmen, all the British
                            officers might have met with Captain Ball's fate. There is, therefore,
                            not the slightest reason for considering the sentences inflicted by the
                            Special Tribunal as erring on the side of severity, and there is no
                            doubt that the mass of European opinion in Egypt and that of the native
                            population which appreciates the integrity of our administration will
                            endorse the verdict. </p>

                        <p>Justice has been done on the murderers of Captain Bull, and on the
                            assailants of the other British officers who were his companions. No one
                            will feel a pang except those extraordinary persons, some of whom are
                            unfortunately members of the House of Commons, to whom the life of a
                            British officer is apparently a fit plaything for any barbarian in the
                            world. The men were tried before a civil tribunal, constituted not ad
                            hoc, but in accordance with an existing agreement between the Khedivial
                            Government and the representatives of the British Protectorate; the
                            accused had the benefit of the best advocacy available at the Egyptian
                            Bar, and the court, European and native alike, unanimously found them
                            guilty of a perfectly unprovoked and deliberately planned attack. Not
                            only as reparation for the death of Captain Bull, and the injuries
                            inflicted on Major Pine-Coffin, but also for the tranquillity of Egypt,
                            it was necessary that a condign example should be made of the brutal
                            villagers of Denishwai. Their fellows will now perceive that the arm of
                            the Egyptian Government, backed by that of Great Britain, is not to be
                            stayed by intrigue which has for its object the overthrow of the régime
                            under which Egypt has, prospered, even in the supposed interests of the
                            Padishah. Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi. Moslem fanaticism
                            appears to have taken fire from recent events to the undoing of these
                            minor criminals, while those who have lit the flame are out of the reach
                            of punishment; but this is what only too often happens in this imperfect
                            world. We may hope, however, that the conspirators whose example aroused
                            the sheep-like fellahin of Danishwai to violence will recognise in time
                            their own impotence. </p>

                        <p>The exemplary sentences passed on the murderers of Captain Bull and on
                            thei accom<cb n="3"/>plices were abundantly justified by the nature and
                            circumstances of the crime. It is perfectly clear, first, that the
                            attack upon the British officers was in no way provoked by the victims,
                            and secondly, that it was due to the recrudescence of fanaticism which
                            has been noticed among the fellaheen during the past year. ln these
                            circumstances, even if there had been any ground for the extension of
                            mercy to the authors of the outrage, such indulgence would have been an
                            act of criminal weakness. In view of the almost microscopic dimensions
                            of the British garrison in Egypt, the moral prestige of the "Red Locust"
                            (as discontented natives call the British soldier) must not be allowed
                            to suffer the slightest diminution. </p>

                        <p>On the clearest evidence, it is now established beyond controversy that
                            the attack on the British officers was not in the least spontaneous, but
                            had been planned and carefully arranged in every detail beforehand.
                            Murder was meant, and murder was brutally accomplished in one instance,

                            Depishwai, and on the local Omdeh, who absented himself precisely at the
                            time of their arrival, that suspicion of complicity chiefly rests. Both
                            of these functionaries must have been well aware of the evil reputation
                            of the Denishwai people for lawlessness and anti-British sentiment. It
                            should be made the matter for most searching inquiry, consequently, how
                            it occurred to the one to Dame Denishwai as the best place in the
                            locality, for pigeon-shooting, and to the other to try to clear himself
                            from responsibility for what he knew was about to happen by removing
                            himself to an adjacent village until the affair had been brought off. It
                            should be especially ascertained whether these officials ever had close
                            relations, political or other, with the nests of Turkish intriguers at
                            Cairo and Alexandria. </p>

                        <p>We dead hardly say that we regard the sentences on the Egyptian natives
                            as at best a very regrettable necessity...So far as we can see, those
                            natives were given a perfectly fair trial, and the sentences are to
                            punish individual guilt and not collective responsibility. That being
                            so, there seems to be no case for interference with the sentences. It
                            has to be remembered that the officers were in uniform, and there seems
                            little doubt that the attack was due, in part at all events, to
                            fanaticism. We have no option but to make it clear that such outbursts
                            cannot be tolerated. </p>

                        <p>We know nothing of the competence or incompetence of the tribunal by
                            which these sentences were giver, and it may have been impossible to
                            avoid passing them. But we must own that we could wish that they had
                            less of the appearance of vindictiveness. There is something repugnant
                            in the administration of punishment in each wholesale measure even if it
                            be unavoidable, and in the present case, when we compare the official
                            report with the cabled summaries of evidence", we think some extenuating
                            circumstances appear which might have mitigated the penalty on all but
                            the actual murderers. </p>

                        <p>The Money Market.</p>
                        <p>The position of the money market today reflects its general condition
                            throughout the past six months. Doubt and uncertainty have been the
                            prevailing features, but even the most pessimistic prophet did not, at
                            the beginning of the year, forecast the state of stringency under which
                            we have been labouring.</p>
                        <p>The general state of trade throughout the country has undoubtedly been
                            good, but it must nevertheless have been hampered by the dearness of
                            money, which, of course, affects general credit, making it relatively
                            dear. It is impossible to survey the general field of finance without
                            feeling that some disturbing factors are at work, the removal of which
                            is a necessity before we shall be able to enjoy the ease which comes
                            from normal times. No doubt the unfortunate state of poor distracted
                            Russia is a serious disturbing element, affecting us, not to a great
                            extent directly, but to a considerable degree through the Continental
                            centres. The United States, with its booming trade on the one hand, and
                            sad earthquake disaster on the other, has doubtless had a much more
                            direct effect.</p>
                        <p>The trouble created by these disturbing factors has, of course, only been
                            intensified by the inadequacy of our gold reserves, and the only
                            satisfaction to be gleaned is from the fact that the question is likely
                            to receive some earnest attention. To-day we see the matter exemplified.
                            The Bank has gained considerable strength during the last few weeks, and
                            there is a good supply of floating credits. Notwithstanding this, owing
                            to the fact that there is some doubt as to what will become of the gold
                            supplies, amounting to about one million, during next week, a feeling of
                            uncertainty has arisen, and in some quarters the more hopeful view which
                            had been gaining ground bag been abandoned. France, of course, is
                            bidding for the gold, and the exchange at 25.15 is low enough to warrant
                            her taking it ; then the weakness of the American rate may result, at
                            any moment, in gold being taken for New York, notwithstanding that the
                            price of the metal bus advanced to about 77s. 10d. It is, therefore,
                            time that some means should be adopted to avoid the disturbance caused
                            by even the withdrawal of these comparatively small events. Credit
                            dealers are now calling the day to day money rate about 3% and are
                            charging 3 1/2% for weekly advances, and the discount rate for 3 months
                            bills stands firm at 3 1/4%. Six months bills, which now take us into
                            next year, and will have to be carried for a considerable period on dear
                            money, are quoted at 3 5/16 to 33%</p>
                        <p>The Bank Return is not very interesting this week. The principal feature
                            is the addition of nearly two millions to the "Other Deposits," which,
                            however, has been added at the expense of Other Securities, showing the
                            market's borrowings from the Bank, in order to make a good showing in

                        <p>So far from the reduction of the Bank rate tending to an improvement in
                            speculative business on the Stock Exchange, as we have from time to time
                            been told would be the case, the conditions this week have been the most
                            depressing experienced for a considerable time past, and the
                            disappointment of dealers has been intensified by the fact that on
                            Wednesday the markets sharply recovered from the state of extreme
                            weakness prevailing on the first two days of the week, only to relapse
                            again into idleness yesterday. A significant instance of the despondency
                            is found in the remarkable decline in Consols, which up to Tuesday had
                            lost ⅞ since the Bank rate was reduced. Enormous quantities of these
                            stocks have been disposed of, chiefly, it is stated, by the insurance
                            companies, who have thas been releasing funds to meet their recent
                            losses. When the selling ceased the quotation considerably improved, but
                            yesterday it was down again.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, the settlement has passed off without any failures being
                            reported, though it is understood that the events of the past account
                            have caused very grave anxiety in more than one case.</p>
                        <p>The gravity of Russian affairs has continued to make itself felt on the
                            Continental bourses, and though there has not been much liquidation of
                            the bonds, support has been studiously withheld. The Stook Exchange has
                            closely followed this example, and the quotations remain at the low
                            level touched last week.</p>
                        <p>About the only satisfactory feature in the markets has been the
                            improvement in home rails, which is none the less welcome because it is
                            long overdue. </p>

                        <p>The gilt-edged share market has been in a parlous state, and at one time
                            the quotation for Console was within 1/18 of the lowest point touched
                            during the war. The conclusion of the liquidations responsible for this
                            was signalized by a rise in the price to 88 ¼ , but yesterday there was
                            a further drop to 87 15/16, at which they close to-night. The new Irish

                            markets last week has been absent, Russian securities have been left
                            severely alone. On the Stock Exchange, the Fours dropped 3/4 to 78, and
                            the new loan to 3 1/2 discount, but subsequently benefited by the
                            general cheerfulness on Wednesday. They leave off to-night at 78 1/2 and
                            3 ⅛ discount respectively. Japanese stocks are steady. The 4 1/2 %
                            (1905) are higher, and the Fours have put on ⅛. </p>

                        <p>Home Ralls. Last week we ventured the opinion that the improvement
                            noticed in the home railway market might be the commencement of the
                            revival which has been prophesied for some months past. The strength of
                            this section since our last encourages us in the hope. In spite of the
                            depression in other markets home rails have kept firm, and in several of
                            the heavies substantial advances have been marked, London and North
                            Western putting on 1 ¼ in one day. The reaction yesterday bad only a
                            slight effect, and in the main the higher prices are being maintained.
                            Speculation is rife regarding the forthcoming reports and dividends of
                            the railway companies which are being awaited with great interest, and
                            with confidence. The past half year has been a remarkably successful
                            period for British lines, and the aggregate increase in profits has been
                            enormous. The traffic gains of the North Eastern and L. and N. W. alone
                            for the twenty-five weeks to date amount to close upon half-a-million
                            pounds, while the Midland and Lancashire are respectively £153,000 and
                            £101,000 to the good. </p>

                            following the break up in Wall Street the previous night, there was a
                            substantial amount of liquidation, and prices were severely affected,
                            several of the shares losing from 2 to 2 3/4 points. To-day there has
                            been a return to better conditions, and appreciable advances are
                            recorded. The demand for Baltimore and Ohio seems to have been
                            satisfied, and the closing quotation is about last week's level. Chicago
                            Milwaukee have been a bad point, and up to last night had lost as much
                            as 7 since our last. They have, however, participated in to-day's
                            improvement, and leave off 3 better on the day at 179 ½ . Steel Common
                            and Preference have been weak, but close firmer at 37 1/2 and 105. </p>
