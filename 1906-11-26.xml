                    <head>BAGHDAD RAILWAY BOHEME</head>
                    <p>M, André Cheradamo, in an article in th,' "Energie Française,"makes a strong
                        sppea I In favour of the urgency of giving the Baghdad Railway the
                        international character which in many quarters it is recognised that it
                        ought to have. He recalls tho fact that the arrangement between the
                        Anatolian Railway and the Ottoman Government, which is the charter of the
                        future line, places it under a purely German hegemony. The German campaign
                        carried on with the object of securing the issue in France in May. I903,of
                        several hundred million franc' worth of shares in the Baghdad Railway had to
                        be abandoned owing to the intervention of the French Government,whicKafter a
                        discreet exchange of views between London and Pari», recognized the enormous
                        importance of the question. M Cheradame adds that the syndicate interested
                        in tho scheme includes French contractors and financiers. He, however, warns
                        Frenchmen who may think of inventing in the line that it cannot pay for at
                        least ten or fifteen years after i s completion. This would necessarily lead
                        to a temporary depreciation of their shares sufficient to cause French
                        holders to re-sell them to the Germans, "who would thus do an excellent
                        stroke of business financially after succeeding in an admirablo political
                        operation." He further gives his reasons for believing that Turkey will
                        never be able to pay a kilometric guarantee on a line of
                        suchgreatlength.lloasks whether Franc-should open her market to an
                        enterprise which in existing conditions would expose French inveatora to
                        serious loss. Farther, should she facilitate an enterprise tending to
                        confirm the absorption of Asia Minor by the Germans and their commercial aud
                        political penetration in tho Balkans and Central Europe ! Die question of
                        the Baghdad Railway is, he contends, of the greatest political importance,
                        not only for Europe, but for the whole world, since it» realization in
                        existing circumstances would be equivalent to the extension of German
                        political and economic influence from Hamburg to tho Persian Gulf.</p>
                    <p>.Setting aside nil idea of systematic opposition to the principle of the
                        Baghdad Railwav, M. Cheradame maintains that there is still tim-to try to
                        prevent it from remaining pred-> minantly German. It must, he says, assume
                        the genuinely international character which can alone place it upon a solid
                        financial basis ami make it serve the interest of all, instead of a
                        formidable conflict. Who, heasks. in addition to Germany and Turkey ought to
                        form part of the international syndicate? First ..fall Russia, who is
                        threatened by the new railwavin the south of tho Caucasus, then England; who
                        is interested in seeing that tho shortest route to India should not be
                        utilized against lier by Germany,a possible adversary,and, finally, Frence,
                        whose considerable interests of all kinds are threatened with destruction hy
                        Germany. He adds "Germany could not possibly take offence at a campaign in

                        uohappiness on herself and all hers. She dies—on the stage—at the end. There
                        we had what Jane Hadiog has not given before. She was as great as ever,
                        moviûg os all; many people conld not help showing it, and I think every one
                        felt it The vcice, that wonderful voice, so faint, sorrowful, all hat

                        as wonderful as ever in the scene where «he implores Sariorys not to fight
                        M. Arnaud had less to do than nsnal, and the others hardly rose to the
                        oocaiyon, thongh at one moment M. Grammont was really good. M. Garat
                        (Sarto-rys) was perhaps bettor than nsnal, but he always just fills short
                        somehow of a real effort. He and Graunmont (as Brigard) in the death soene
                        were not at all good. The convention was badly marked and the effect nearly
                        spoiled ; it would have been quite spoiled, had we not end ali been

                        nothing less than exs'penRing, and yet it is so essy to avoid them. It seems
                        to bo simply carelessness and lack of real attention to the play, that very
                        lack of attention which the players evidently feel at once, and resent by
                        overaoting, underacting, or even laughing at their audience. Wbat wonder !

                    <p>Having, under Mme Hading', auspices, gone through an exhaustive study nf tho
                        eternal triangle in all its aspects, it is something of a rebel to turn to
                        so admirables drama as Sudermann's "Stein unter Steinen,"—to turn, that is
                        to say, from romsnee to reality. For it is reality, or rather realism, that
                        forms the essence of the play. It contains, properly speaking, only one
                        problem, but one which "gives furiously to think," namely the question
                        whether Zarncke, in employing discharged conviot», ia right in appealing to
                        what little bononr they may cr may not have by placing them in positions of
                        trost, and scff«ring accordingly. For the rest the drama atonnda in unique
                        pictures of human nature. Take any one of the men or women whom Snder* manu
                        so excellently portrays. No sooner are we introduced to them than we can
                        tell a1mo>t to a certainty what lies bsdore them ; no character is nntrne to
                        itself; each pursues its coarse onswetvingly. For instance, in Aot III., the
                        stone-masons, accustomed to Biegler's oower ing demeanour, aro astounded at
                        his sadden outbreak, but we are not : crushed though he be by his five
                        years' sentence lor manslaughter, we have seen sufficient of him to know
                        that he will be unable to endure Giittliogk'a insolence. Nor should it
                        surprise us that Gottlingk, being thwarted, will seek his revenge, that Lore
                        will at length abandon hope cf marriage with him, the father of her child,
                        that Marie will eventually yield to his allurements, that Strove, the
                        pbilosophia old gaol biid, will betray the trost placed iu him, that,
                        finally, Biegler, whose disinterested motives recall Bernard Shaw's "Devil's
                        Disciple," will at last overcome the scruples of his fallow-workmen and
                        chase away the shadows which haunt his past There was never a more
                        consistent play and seldom a better eonstrootod one. Each character speaks
                        and behaves exactly as might be expected nnder the circumstances, and thus
                        the dramatic situations seldom take ns nnawares. But ever fresh matter for
                        serions thought is afforded as well as admiration lor the skill wilh which
                        the plot is unfolded. There was one slight jarring note, when Sodermann
                        carries his realism a little too fir : Biegler, after his violent scene with
                        Giittlingk, returns to finish his glass of beer. Now, no donbt, yonr loyal
                        German will as soon think of leaving his beer untouched as of openly abusing
                        the Kaiser or of sitting in a drafty room ; yet Biegler's action
                        rankled.</p>
                    <p>As regard, the production of this play, on Satnrday, by Sig. G. Novelli'e
                        Italian company, we will only say that, although all did their best, the
                        acting on tho whole was below ihe standard required. Signori Novelli,
                        Tettoni, and 8pinelli, respectively,as Biegler,Gd'tlingk, and Strove, did
                        well enough. Sig. Greco's Zarncke was too stagey, but Siga. Vida'.i made a
                        creditable Lore.</p>
                    <p>Any pleasure the play might have afforded ns was entirely spoilt by the
                        persistence of the prompter to make his tinny, rançons voice carry not only
                        to the aotors but over the whole theatre, despite the effort, of the
                        audience and of Sig. Novelli himself to repress him. Otherwise the play was
                        well received.</p>

                        <head>ARE EGYPTIANS FANATICS ?</head>
                        <p>To the Editor op the "Eqtptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—This question, like all otbor national quostions, is very
                            difficult to answor, and it is certainly qoite as fallaoions to answor
                            it in the negative as in the sffinnativo.</p>
                        <p>Bot I propose to point outsomo facts gained from persooal experience
                            which, I hopo, will throw some light on this important subjeot. The
                            Egyptians are roughly speaking composed of two ol-s«ee, vix —tbe
                            Fellaheen and the modern educated Moslems. By far the majority of tho
                            inhabitants of Egypt are Fellaheeo, and they are certainly not lanatio*,
                            bat are enjoying the fruits of perce, tranquillity, good rule and
                            prosperity. They are shrewd and keen bnsiness men, whose motto is "Heap
                            op richer and boy more land"; and in fact that is what they preotioally
                            live for.</p>
                        <p>Tbeseoond olass is composed of the educated, Boropeanly dressed natives
                            who are mostly young men of the middle and nppor olasies. It is among
                            this body that wo find men of the fanatioal tern of mind, who do a great
                            deal of harm by their writing in the native press and by their
                            inflammablo talk. Many woeld think that the educated modorn Egyptian
                            should be the last to adopt fanatioiam, but there are two important
                            faotors at work which produce snob dislike towards the Christians.</p>
                        <p>First is the anti-Christian atmosphere of the Government schools in which
                            they were brooght op, and secondly the disfavonrism of the Copts in
                            almost every Government As regards the first, I shall speak with some
                            little authority, as it is only six yetra ago since I finished my ten
                            years conrae in these schools, whore everybody is treated as a Moslem.
                            For five years I attended a primary eohool where the majority of boys
                            were of my faith, vit.. Native Christians, commonly known as Copts.</p>
                        <p>AU the eoholars need to learn the Koran (I can now recite many chapters
                            of tbs Moslem "Bible" whiob I lesrot by heart 17 years ago). Sunday was
                            tbe hardest day in the week, Friday was onr Sabbath ; we were tanght tho
                            principles of Islam, we had short boors during the month of Ramadan, bad
                            long holidays with the few Moslem boys at tbeir festivals, and at onr
                            'Xma* and Easter we had a day or two for each, but with a grodge, tho
                            sobool remaining open tor the sake of the few Moslem boys. Io short
                            Christian scholars were ignored io all the school despite the fact that
                            they were far greater in nomber.</p>
                        <p>This onjost treatment had a bad effect on the Moslem minority and made
                            them believe that the low classes were right in oalling the Christian "a
                            dog" (the moat despised animal in Bgypt) which was not worthy of any
                            con-aideratioo.</p>
                        <p>Tho we-don't-want-yon air towards the Christi» aoholara seemed to hang
                            aboot io every Government school and oollego and I felt that air in the
                            eeoondaty school more then any other.</p>
                        <p>If this wore the case with the bringing up of the modem Moslem and is
                            still praotisod day after day, can we wonder at the ednosted olasses if
                            they treat the Christian with con-tempt I</p>
                        <p>The only remedy lies in the bringing op of tho younger generation to the
                            foil knowledge and understanding that Christians are not inferior to
                            Moslems, that the former oan have Snnday as their day ef teat and can be
                            instruoted in their own faith and not in a faith different to that of
                            tbeir parents. Tbe native Christians never grnable, because they have
                            boen need to more or leas persecutions for tho last thirteen centuries
                            and know that, being a small minority, their ory will not be heeded to,
                            but I most say that the perseootions of the present time are harder to
                            bear than any other because we are roled by Christian brothors.</p>
                        <p>This brings me to the second faotor, vie, tho disfavonrism of the Copts
                            in the Government services. This polioy is undoubtedly helping the modem
                            Bgyptian to be a fanatic more than anything else. Ask any Moslem Effendi
                            you come aorosa, why tho Anglo-Egyptians do loi allow a Copt to become a
                            mondir, wakes), governor, anb-govornor or even a eohool headmaster, no
                            matter how able the Copt may be ; and he will answer yon thus :</p>
                        <p>"The Christian faith being inferior to the Moslem faith, it follows that
                            those who profess the latter most mis over those who profosa the
                            former." Of coarse the Efiendi is wrong in his assertions, but then we
                            must remember that the Modems of the Nile Valloy are notorioes fur
                            hopeleisly m-xing religion and polities togethgr.</p>
                        <p>To prove that the unjust treatment of tho Copts isoau-iDg fanaticism
                            among tho well to-do Moslems of Egypt, I cannot do bettor than fall back
                            on onr history. Since tho invasion of Egypt by the Arabs, and until
                            reoont yoars, ho rulors have alwayA been Mohamedans. We often read that
                            doriug the reign of such and snoh a rnlor, who was kind and joat towards
                            the Christiaus, how tho poople proipor ed and peace ruled all over the
                            land. There again we read that daring tho reign of his son. who hated
                            the Christians, how there were many thousands of Copts masAaorod in the
                            streets, msny obnrohes burnt down, bow life and property were not safe
                            and how the whole nation suffered. Thia proves olearly that tho
                            Egyptians need always to adapt themselves aooordiog to the wishes of
                            their misters and there is no reason at all why histflry should not
                            repeat itself Io faut we can see that it is threatening to do so.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I wish to point ont that if the Anglo-Egyptian Government
                            do not take a</p>
                        <p>lesson from our history and put an end to the nnjost dealings with the
                            native Christians, then they must expect darker days for them-solye*,

                        <p>Sir,—In a reoent issue yon annoonoed the appointment by the French Colony
                            of a so-oond dopnté do la nation, and the announcement suggested to me
                            the idea that it would confor a great boon npon the British ColoDy had
                            we aisoaoeb a perron to officially voice our dO'ires, sentiments, and
                            wees. Io most of the Colonies in the Levant, one or other bigwig whore
                            position or influence aoffiee to entitle him to such a dignity, is
                            called upon to the oolony on any State occasion ; this anawers very well
                            ; eometimee it does not, for there are members among os who take it npon
                            themselves to voice tbe</p>
                        <p>Colonist sentiments and desiderata, whether they'hold ~the' mandate to do
                            so or not Witness.the oase of the British Constitution in far-away

                            onoo published, and caused such a sensation. But that is many years ago.
                            I won't harp back to it Our prosent need, and it is the need in faot of
                            every Colony, is to have each a dopnty to present its weal or woe as
                            occasion may offer : to present King's Birthday congratulations ;
                            memorials, to deliver orations, to plead, exhort, and defend—in a word,
