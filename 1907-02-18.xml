                    <head>ALEXANDRIA HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY</head>
                    <p>A few days ago we published a review of the interesting article on the palms
                        of Egypt, which has been contributed to the Bulletin of the Alexandria
                        Horticultural Society by M. A d'Abaza The Bulletin contains two other very
                        valuable contributions, of which "Some Hints on Rose-growing in Egypt" is a
                        practical guide to the cultivation of the queen of flowers by one who is the
                        acknowledged British "facile princeps" of the art in this country — the
                        Anglo-Egyptian Dean Hole Every word, therefore, from him on this subject is
                        sure to be read with the deepest attention. Dr. Keatinge who, some years
                        ago, gave Alexandrians a much appreciated lecture on rose growing, modestly
                        deprecates any idea of a claim on his part to originality in his 'hints,"
                        most of which he assures us have been culled from the "Boot of the Rose" (by
                        the late Rev. A.<cb n="6"/> Foster Melliar of which he strongly advises the
                        purchase. The sixteen pages of his paper contain valuable hints on every
                        branch of Egyptian rose cultivation, ending with a most useful list of 18
                        hybrid roses, 29 tea roses and 12 climbing varieties, which Dr Keatinge's
                        personal experience has proved will do, Well in this country.</p>
                    <p>The last 18 pages of the Bulletin consist of "Leaves from a Note Book" by
                        Judge Sanders, the vice-president of the committee of the A. H. S., whose
                        reputation as a practical horticulturist and the successful organizer of our
                        Alexandria flower shows, from their commence­ment, has long been
                        established. The "Leaves" contain a large amount of interesting historical
                        information on the subject of Egyptian cultivated plants, from various
                        sources, commencing with a resume of what is known concerning the "Papyrus,"
                        its gradual extinction, and reintroduction of late years. The "Jacaranda,"
                        mentioned as one of the trees intro­duced under Mehemet Ali (1803-1847), is
                        ignored by Delchevalerie in his "Etudes Egyptiennes" (l870) describing all
                        the gardens of Cairo and Alexandria except the one at Alexandria in which
                        the solitary Jacaranda in Egypt existed; nor did he include it in the list
                        of seeds and flowers of all the ornamental trees in Egypt shewn by him at
                        the Vienna Interna­tional exhibition in 1873.</p>
                    <p>The above garden, now belonging to the Jesuit College, but formerly known as
                        Beit Thurburn from its proprietor 80 years ago, was rented by General Sir E.
                        Stanton when Consul General (1866-1876), and the Jacaranda <hi rend="bold">
                            <hi rend="italic">may</hi>
                        </hi> have been planted during his tenure. It was still a very fine tree in
                        1885, but has since disappeared, being a rapid grower but very short-lived ;
                        Delchevalerie mentions the bee for the first time in his "Apercu General,"
                        written for the "Societe d'acclimatation de France" (1881), as flowering and
                        fruiting well in "le jardin de Torborn a Alexandrie" whence it had, by that
                        time, spread over the Delta and been some years in the gardens of Ghizeh,
                        Ghezireh and the Ezbekieh in Cairo The "Jacaranda mimosifolia" (J.
                        Ovalifolia) was introduced to British cultivation from Brazil in 1818 as a
                        stove plant.</p>
                    <p>It is curious that the English name "potato" for the "Solanum tuberosum,"
                        brought by Thomas Harriot (1560-1621), the mathema­tical tutor of Sir W.
                        Raleigh, from Virginia in 1585 (where it seems to have been imported from S.
                        America), should be a corruption of the American name for the "Sweet Potato"
                        (Batatas edulis), a plant of the "convolvulus" family said by von Humboldt
                        to have been brought to Spain by Christopher Columbus 92 years before
                        Virginia was christened ; and again, in 1519, when Pigafetta introduced it
                        from Brazil ; the Batatas was cultivated in Eng and long before the common
                        potato, and the two plants, of such diverse botanical classification, were
                        frequently confounded in contemporary accounts. The potato has long been
                        known in Spanish S. America as "Papas" and the sweet potato as
                        "Batatas."</p>
                    <p>The view of our great lexicographer, cited by Judge Sandars, that "if he was
                        a rich man he would propagate all kinds of trees that grow in the open air,"
                        rather than such as require the shelter of glass, is one that we cordially
                        endorse, especially as applied to the climate of Egypt, for which we have
                        such vast store of beautiful flowering shrubs and herbaceous perennials to
                        draw upon, from similar latitudes in both hemispheres, as com­pared with the
                        possibilities of acclimatisation in Great Britain. We earnestly hope that,
                        under its new financial conditions, the A.H.S. will not confine its efforts
                        entirely to the utilitarian side of horticulture, and will soon gladden our
                        eyes with the sight of some ornamental novelties; for beautiful as our</p>
                    <p>Flamboyants, Jacarandas, Tecomas, Poinsettias, and Oleanders are in our
                        Alexandria gardens, we are tired of seeing the same trees, shrubs and
                        creepers in all of them, and long for some of the many equally hardy
                        flowering and foliage beauties, only waiting to be transferred from their
                        native subtro­pical homes in China, Japan, North and South America, the East
                        and West Indies, Australia, and South Africa to the cosmo­politan land of
                        Egypt.</p>

                            <p>It is understood that an Irish Devolution</p>
                            <p>Bill will be presented as a provisional experi­ment and the
                                arrangements for the constitu­tion of the Irish Council will be left
                                open for enlargement for 10 years' time. It is expected that the
                                Irish Commoners will be ipso facto members of the new Council. The
                                success of the experiment will depend upon the Council's disposal of
                                the money scorning from savings under the Imperial administration.

                    <head>DELTA LAND CO. LTD.<lb/>IMPORTANT DECISIONS.</head>
                    <p>We are authorised by the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company to state
                        that a meeting of the directors held on Saturday confirmed the resolution
                        arrived at by the Delta Light Railway Company's Board to re-affiliate the
                        two companies on the original terms on which the Delta Land Company was
                        formed. This decision must, of course, be confirmed by general meeting of
                        the shareholders.</p>
                    <p>Farther, the London Board of the Delta Land Company having carefully
                        considered the question as to whether the company's business could be
                        administered from London or Egypt, are convinced that in the best interests
                        of the shareholders the administration should be in Egypt and, as a very
                        large majority of the shareholders are resident in Egypt, their convenience
                        would be better studied if general meetings were held in Egypt. Taking these
                        matters into consideration the London Board has generously come to the
                        conclusion that they would best serve the interests of the shareholders by
                        resigning. They have therefore elected the following gentlemen to replace
                        them, viz.. <persName>Mr. P. W. Carver of Alexandria</persName>,
                            <persName>Maurice Cattaui Bey of Cairo</persName>,<persName>Capt. A.
                            Adams</persName>, <persName>R E</persName> , general manager of the
                        Egyptian Delta Light Railways. These three gentlemen, together with
                            <persName>Baron Jacques de Menasce</persName> and <persName>Mr. J. W
                            Williamson</persName>, will form the new board of the Delta Land Co. and
                        it will be farther strengthened by the addition of a mem-her of the firm of
                        Messrs. Snares of Cairo as soon as certain negotiations now pending be-tween
                        the company and Messrs. Snares are completed.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to hear that the new Board of the Delta Land Co. have made
                        very strong representations to Sir Auckland Colvin, K C S.I, K.C.M.G.,
                        C.I.E, to remain honorary president of the company. Sir Auckland has not yet
                        definitely accepted but we feel confident we are voicing the wishes of the
                        shareholders in begging of him to give a favourable answer to this request,
                        for the able and generous manner in which he has brought to an amicable
                        solution the outstanding differences between the London and local Boards of
                        the company has endeared him to the shareholders, who feel that with Sir
                        Auckland Colvin as honorary president of their company they would not be
                        severing their connection with him,</p>

                    <p>We beg to draw the attention of our readers to the three interesting
                        prospectuses which we publish in another part of to day's issue. "Levico
                        Limited" is the conversion of the well-known and respected Alexandrian firm
                        of Messrs V. Levi and Company into an English limited liability company. "La
                        Barque d'Escompte et de Reports" is a new bank, which will no doubt attract
                        the serious attention of the investing public. The Nile Transport Company
                        will fill a need in catering for the ever increasing development of Nilotic
                        navigation.</p>
                    <p>Another issue, which we announce to day, is that of the Express Nile Steamers
                        Limited. The fall details of this new issue will be found in the next
                        paragraph.</p>

                    <p>Or, comme les porteurs d'actions anciennes auront droit à 2 actions nouvelles
                        poor une ancienne, il en resultera pour eux un bénéfice d environ £ 6 qu'ils

                    <p>Voilà donc la question exposée au point de vue purement financier, mais
                        l'affaire est, d'ailleurs, par elle-même excellente et d'un avenir brillant.
                        Les résultats quelle a déjà donnés out été remarquablement satisfaisants ;
                        on peut même dire qu'ils ont été réellement surprenants et ont dépassé
                        toutes les espé­rances, car avec un premier capital minime, la Société a
                        réussi en un court laps de temps, à organiser et a faire fonctionner un
                        service de voyageurs et an service de marchandées qui marchent à souhait.
                        Or, l'augmentation du capital social permettra de donner à ces deux branches
                        an service des marchandises notam­ment, un développement appelé à donner des
                        bénéfices considérables, en présence des avan­tages incontestables que le
                        transport par la voie du Nil offre de plus en plus au commerce.</p>
                    <p>C'est, du reste, pour répondre spécialement à ces desiderata auxquels elle ne
                        pouvait guère satisfaire avec un matériel insoffi-tant que la Société a
                        résolu d'augmenter sa flottille, de manière à faire progressivement face à
                        tontes les demandes de9 négociants.</p>
                    <p>Comme on le voit, l'entreprise est extrême­ment promettante. Elle répond à un
                        besoin public qui s'aoon Itra avec l'extension que prendra nécessairement la

                    <p>Antiquaries Alarmed </p>
                    <p>PROTEST TO LORD CROMER.</p>
                    <p>Antiquaries of London has heard with tome surprise that a proposal is
                        seriously entertained by the Egyptian Govern­ment to raise the level of the
                        Nile dam at Assouan to the height originally proposed. The Society would
                        point out that it is informed that such an alteration would, at high Nile,
                        submerge the temples at Philae, and would result also in the flooding of a
                        large area in Nubia undoubtedly containing many interest­ing sites. The
                        Society feels bound to enter a protest against any scheme that would involve
                        such a wholesale destruction of archæologîcal remains unless it be clearly
                        demonstrated that the scheme is an absolute necessity for the well being of
                        Egypt, and that the same bene­fits cannot be obtained in any other way. The
                        Society feels the greater confidence in making the protest to the Egyptian
                        Government in view of the important and costly works of con­servation that
                        have already been carried out at Philae."</p>
                    <p>The prime mover in this agitation is Mr. Somers Clarke. This gentleman sent a
                        letter to the Society of Antiquaries calling attention to a proposal to
                        raise the dam at Assouan to the level originally suggested, despite the
                        undertaking given in 1894 that it should not be carried higher than at
                        present. Mr. Clarke recalled the disastrons effect such raining would entail
                        both as regards the temples at Philae, and a large part of Nubia, which
                        would be hopelessly drowned, and suggested that the Society should take
                        action in the matter. </p>

                    <p>"SAMSON ET DALILA."</p>
                    <p>What a contrast to last year's excellent performance ! It serves us right for
                        grambling then. Mme. Chaix Bonheur saved the 2nd act by good acting and
                        scientific use of a rather distasteful voice. M. Moisson was far but
                        colourless ; M. Mézy voluminous and insccu- rate. The flower chorus was of
                        course hope- less, and—here Mme. Chaix Bonheur and M. Mézy should have done
                        better. The fine fugal duet and chorus at the end was badly sang. She was
                        too slow and he too fast. The ballet pleased a good many people : certainly
                        Mlle. </p>
                    <p>Saturday evening was so balmy and warm that the hall doors of the Savoy were
                        opened wide and the dancers took fall advantage of the verandah between the
                        dances, which were not finished till nearly half past one. The warmth of the
                        ball room was quite excessive at times, and many people preferred to take
                        their pleasure gently, though there were a few who clamoured for more even
                        after the orchestra had left.</p>
                    <p>There were a good many strangers present on Saturday, and at one end of the
                        room there was a bevy of some of the most beautiful frocks that have been
                        seen this season. One especially attracted the notice of everyone : it was
                        in white ont en princesse and had wide glittering lines of silver fall­ing
                        from the bust to the hem, where there was a border of delicately painted
                        roses. The same painted roses mingled with silver formed the sleeves and the
                        decolletage, lines of thin filmy black outlining the fulness and being
                        gathered into a big bow high at the back. Close by the wearer of this lovely
                        frock was another in a dull deep shade of heliotrope with broad bands of
                        dull silver lace on the skirt and corsage, the trimming the latter being
                        continued over the shoul­ders and in a deep square across the back.</p>
                    <p>Lord and Lady Lanesborough were present, and Lady Newborough, who looked
                        magnificent in a grey brocade, the bodice spark ling with jewels. The
                        Countess of Hollnstein was also most handsomely attired and wore beautiful
                        jewels. Lord and Lady Vivian were here, and Col. El Lewa and Mrs. Watson
                        were also among the dancers, the latter wearing a handsome pink silk dress
                        trimmed with garlands of double stitched ruchings. Miss Blyth was with Capt.
                        and Mrs. Rome ; and Mrs. and Miss Crofton were with Mrs. and Miss Carey and
                        Miss Fox: Miss Crofton in blue embroidered with roses, Miss Carey wearing a
                        lovely frock of white chiffon embroidered with marguerites and bordered with
                        doll green panne, while the latter was in diamentée white. Mrs. Armstrong
                        was in very handsome gown of white moire en- ornsted with heavy lace and
                        bordered with large pompadour roses. Mrs. Mende's hand­some dress of blue
                        was also adorned with pink roses, and one of her near neighbours had lovely
                        panels of painted roses on her dress. Mrs. Stout was in a very pretty frock
                        of fine lace, and Miss McKellar had on a delightful frock of black net
                        trimmed with bands of velvet and lace and showing pointed vest and sleeves
                        of white lace. Mrs Park Lyle was wearing a lovely bandeau o diamonds and
                        turquoise across her hair, herf dress of soft satin bearing insertions of
                        lace or net covered with ruchings and bands of satin.</p>

                    <p>A rather colourless performance except for the workroom scene, and the last
                        act of all. Both these were well enough done : the "Batte. Montmartre" scene
                        needed far more singing than M. Fontaine and Mlle. Charpentier could
                        give.The orchestra was rather tame throughout. After all, "Lonise" is a
                        disappointing opera. It has really original effects: the daybreak scene at
                        Montmartre, the workroom, and the duet at Julien's house, followed by the
                        entry of the masqueraders, are charming in conception and in execation. Poor
                        M. Monteux ! really was amusing as the pape des fous, not the audience will
                        only laugh at his voice every time he tries to sing. His acting is not so
                        bad ; — this by the way. The scenes which might have been great are also
                        charming—but no more. The duet, and the whole finale, that stirring "Paris
                        m'appelle"—what an oppor­tunity for a really great composer who could have
                        shown the soul of it all, love, revolt, con­vention, and the call of that
                        great city tearing that convention to pieces, exacting worship and suffering
                        of its sons and daughters !</p>

                    <p>The fine old filibustering sentiment of "Ernani" seemed to please the
                        performers, and more especially Sig. Arrighetti, who was in splendid form.
                        Sig. Lucenti was, as ever, delightful all through. Sig. Battani is most
                        disappointing this year to many of those who delighted in him during the
                        summer : but I confess I cannot agree with them alto­gether. He has not the
                        exquisite delicacy which made certain songs so memorable, but it seems to me
                        that his voice is far fuller and more developed, especially in the low
                        notes. It may be simply the bad weather, or it may be that his voice is (if
                        such things do happen !) in a state of transition from lyric to strong
                        tenor. But the fact remains that he, Lucenti, and Arrighetti hold their own
                        against the music and that the conductor has not to be always thinking
                        whether a big orchestral effect will drown his voice. It is a pity his
                        acting is so poor. His manipulation of the dagger (and, indeed, all the
                        death scene) was rather absurd.</p>
                    <p>"FEDORA."</p>
                    <p>"Fedora" halted at first, but improved rapidly, and, taken altogether, was a
                        fine performance. Sig. Orbellini was distinctly ex­cellent, as was Sig.
                        Mastropasqau, who acted delightfully. Sig. Tschierdo sang the part of Loris
                        really well. Sig. de Padova is a moat useful if rather light baritone. The
                        "Chopin" scene was better done than is usually the case ; the pianist is not
                        often a success, but he certainly was quite good in this case. Sig.
                        Campanini is certainly a fine conductor, he knows his mario thoroughly, and
                        has a thorough grasp of orchestra, chorus, and prin­cipals as well. They all
                        have to do their utmost for him ; it was absolutely fascinating at times to
                        watch his "bàson" and his hands and to notice how instantaneous was the
                        response. It seemed impossible for his "per­sonnel'' to go wrong. We saw
                        this in "Mefis- tofele" and ' Faust," and it was most marked in "Fedora." It
                        is the height of pleasure to see such thorough mastery and knowledge
                        combined.</p>

                        <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre A Londres se maintient à 4 3/4 pour cent. Au
                            Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a rétrogradé hier de 1/8 A a7.
                            L'Unifiée est restée invariée A 102 3/4. La National Bank a perdu 1/8 A
                            28 1/4. L'Agricole est demeurée inchagee A 10, de même que la Daira A 17
                            1/2. La Delta Light a gagné 1/8 A 11 7/8 </p>
                        <p>À Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyptien et la Banque d'Athenes ont cloture a
                            leurs prix precedents, soit 775 et 135. Les Lots turcs ont avancé de 3
                            francs A 155.</p>
                        <p>* *</p>
                        <p>Ici, la séance de ce matin a été plutôt calme mais la tenue générale du
                            marché a été in­contestablement meilleure qu'hier. Eu outre, la côture a
                            été marquée par de l'anima­tion et de la fermeté, ce qui est d'un bon
                            augure et fait espérer une reprise. Aussi est-il regrettable qu'on nous
                            réserve, pour la semaine prochaine encore, une série d'é­missions dont
                            les effets pourraient bien entraver tontes les bonnes dispositions
                            pos­sibles. On ne saurait vraiment trop engager les promoteurs de
                            nouvelles entreprises A mo­dérer leur ardeur, A endiguer le flot
                            impétu­eux de leurs appels de fonds, de facon A ne nuire ni aux antres,
                            ni surtout A eux-mêmes. Certes, le soleil luit pour tout le monde et il
                            y a de la place pour tous; mais encore est-il prudent da ne pas bourrer
                            A outrance le mar-che égyptien, qui souffre deja visiblement d'une
                            indigestion de titres don l'écoulement semble requérir des drastiques
                            violents. * Fes­tin» lente." On ne perd rien pour attendre, surtout
                            lorsqu'il s'agit de bonnes affaires; l'es­sentiel est de les espacer et
                            de les produire à des moments opportuns et favorables.</p>
                        <p>Dans le compartiment des Banques, la Na­tional a clôturé A son prix
                            précédent, soit 28 1/16-1/8, de même que l'Agricole A 9 7/8. Les parts
                            de fondateur du Comptoir Financier, fractionnées en dix Ames, ont été
                            traitées A £ 9.</p>
                        <p>Le Crédit Fonder a rétrogradé A .721 et son obligation A lots 1886 A
                            343.La D.ira est restée immobile A 17 6/16-3/8. L'Agrioole du Nil est
                            remontée A 255: par contre, sa part a faibli A 7 5/16. La Nile Land est
                            revenue A 22 5/8 et le Wardan A 7 1/2-9/16. L'Union Foncière s'est
                            tassée A 6 1/4.. L'Allotment s'est encore alour­di A 3 1/4-5/16; sa part
                            a cloture a 125.</p>
                        <p>Les Entreprises Immobilères et Travaux ont regagné une livre A 10; en
                            bonne demande, leur part a avancé A P.E. 225. L'Epargne Im­mobilière a
                            été ramenée A 3 1/8; sa part a terminé A* 2 2, après avoir fléchi A 190;
                            ce sont la des cours transitoires appelés assurément a attirer
                            l'attention des acheteurs.</p>
                        <p>L'Express Nile a été l'objet de fluctuations qui l'ont portée de 6 1/4 A
                            6 5/8 eu attendant mieux par suite des gros avantages offerts par la
                            nouvelle émission fixée au 20 da courant; sa part a avancé A 330.
                            L'Anglo-American Nile fléchi A 5 3/8-7/16, les Ciments A 53 et' la
                            Brasserie des Pyramides à 126.</p>
                        <p>Dans le groupe des valeurs hôtelières, les Nungovich ont haussé jusqu'A
                            30 1/8 pour terminer A 29 3/4. Les Upper Egypt ont avancé A 4
                            13/16-7/8.</p>
                        <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, la Delta Land s'est raffermie A 4 1/4. Les
                            Markets sont remontés a 30 sh.</p>
                        <p>Dana la séance qu'elle a tenue hier soir l'as­semblée générale da la
                            Corporation des Agents de change du Caire a continué de s'occuper des
                            modifications très importantes proposées dans les statuts de la
                            Corporation.</p>
                        <p>L'assemblée a passé ensuite A l'élection du nouveau Comité. M.M. H.
                            Boutigny, E.C. Hogg, D. K. Raid et Henri de Vries ont déclaré
                            formellement, qu'ils déliraient ne pas faire partie du nouveau Comité et
                            ont, par consé­quent, prié les membres de ne pas porter leurs voix ear
                            leurs noms.</p>
                        <p>Après quoi, l'assemblée a procédé A l'élec­tion da nouveau Comité, dont

                    <p>The Directors have been connected with Egypt for many years, and they are
                        confident that there 'an immense field available for remunerative trade and

                        between Egypt and other countries, and having regard to the time and
                        political situation and the period of prosperity through which Egypt is
                        passing, they are of opinion that the present is propitious, and they
                        anticipate a successful and remunerative career for this Company, and they
                        have great reliance in the personality of the Manager, who is well known and

                        of the Company, and accordingly have arranged to themselves subscribe for

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
