                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND U.S.A. </head>
                    <p>In his annual report concerning the commerce of Egypt, the American
                        Consul-General, Mr. Iddings, again calls the attention of American exporters
                        to the trade requirements of this country. He outlines opportunities that
                        exist for increasing American trade, and offers suggestions that should
                        prove of value to those seeking it.</p>
                    <p>"A decided increase of interest in Egyptian trade, as indicated by letters of
                        inquiry received at this agency and consulate-general, has been shown by
                        American manufacturers, which is most encouraging The conditions which
                        American manufacturers must meet if they wish to sell their wares in Egypt
                        have not changed since they were set forth in previous reports Credit must
                        be given, add "cash payment with the order" must not be insisted on. The
                        manufacturer who sells the goods must interest himself to see that delivery
                        is as prompt as possible." </p>
                    <p>"Inquiries as to the possibility of establishing a direct steamship line
                        between New York and Alexandria have brought forth the following
                        observations from a shipping merchant and business map of Cairo, who was for
                        a long time a leading manager of a successful line of British steamships." </p>
                    <p>"A direct Ainerican line of steamships between New York and Alexandria,
                        stopping at Marseille or Genoa, arriving once in 10 days, might, succeed
                        without a subsidy. It would take $15,000,000 to establish it. The big ships
                        would run to Alexandria, carrying many passengers. Small steamers, to act as
                        feeders for the big direct ships, should collect freight at all the
                        principal eastern Mediterranean ports. They could make the round from
                        Alexandria, touching at Port Said, Jaffa, Beirout, Mersine, Smyrna,
                        Constantinople Athens and Patmos. If such a line is ever seriously
                        projected, there is much to be advised in regard to the construction and
                        management of its steamships. Room still exists in Egypt for an American
                        bank which would transact business with the United States without the aid of
                        Paris and London. The legal banking rate in Egypt is 19% but 12 % is easily
                        made. There are no cities in the world where there are better conditious for
                        lending money on good security than in in Cairo and Alexandria. Some of the
                        Egyptian banks in Cairo would like to establish branches in New York, but
                        their charters forbid. Certain French banks are not thus fettered, but
                        French banking ways would hardly suit Americans so well as English methods.
                        An American bank would naturally obtain the business of American tourists,
                        who in 1906 came in larger number than ever before</p>

                            organs appears to be on the increase, despite the iling acute financial
                            crisis. Last week we announced the foundation of an Italian daily new at
                            Alexandria, "La Patria," and in a few days time a French daily paper
                            will make its appearance. It is to -e published every morning, and will
                            be the first newspaper at Alexandria to be printed on Linotype machines.
                            It is to be called "Les Nouvelles' and the editor will be Mr. Du. mani,
                            who edited a paper of the same name, which after attaining considerable
                            popularity, suddenly disappeared. It will be printed at the Inprimerie
                            Mourea.</p>

                    <p>The proceedings betore the Native Court yesterday began at 9.30 am.</p>
                    <p>The advocate Mustafa El Khadem stated in his defence that the Parquet had not
                        proved that Spiro Bey or Safwat had received a bribe so neither of them were
                        guilty of corruption: The most important witness for the prosecution was
                        Mahmdnd Neghib, who was under Safwat's orders on the quay. He declared that
                        Safwat asked him for £5 as a bribe, and he reported this to Sir, Massie
                        Blomfield and then to the Deputy Director General, bat as no steps were
                        taken he sent his accusation to the Finance Ministty, who sent down a
                        delegate to enquire.</p>
                    <p>The chief of the Parquet said that in the beginning of 1907 the Finance
                        Ministry found out the corruption in the Ports and Lights and this is due to
                        the authority, given to this administration to appoint employées whom they
                        choose fit for the posts as exceptional cases without regard to regalations,
                        and this is the why the officinls such as Spiro Bey etc., began to follow
                        the which has led to the present case.</p>
                    <p>The Finatice Ministry then sent a delegate to open an inquiry with Dixon Bey,
                        who made strict investigations gnd concluded that the origin of corraption
                        was from Spiro Bey and Attiah Eff. in whose bands are nearly all the admini-
                        strative works, promotions and transfers etc. Then the chief of Parquet
                        pointed out how the first witness paid a bribe to Attiah who is the
                        assistant of Spiro Bey.</p>
                    <p>The chief of the Parquet is of opinion that the prisoner Attiah ought to havé
                        sent a reply to the registered letter of Hafer, if he had not really
                        received the sum of LE 54 from him ( Hafez ) therefore that Attiah has
                        really received this sum as a bribe for himself and Spiro Bey (who is
                        absent) and consequently both of them are guilty. Sitting adjourned to 4
                        p.m.</p>
                    <p>The Court reassembled subsequently and heard some more witnesses, after which
                        the Coart pronounced the following sentences :— Socrates Spiro Bey,three
                        years imprisonment and a fine of L.E. 54.</p>

                    <p>ment and a fine of LE 54.</p>
                    <p>These two were charged with receiving bribes.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Marad and Darvish Mustapha, found guilty of falsifying documents,
                        were each sentenced toxine year's imprisonment and the former fined L.E. 50
                        and LE. 30 costs.</p>

                    <p>We have recently published a notice of an extraordinary general meeting in
                        the Egyptian Constructions Limited, which is to be held at 4 p.m. on the
                        21st inst: in Cairo, The company was started in February, 1906, and is an
                        Nangovich Bey, Chairman, Mr. Montagu Summers, Mr. Thomas McClure, Mr.
                        Stanley Dorling and Mr. GL. Pezzi The capital was £100,000 in 100,000 shares
                        of £1 each, with power to increase to £200,000 by. resolution of the Board.
                        The shares have stood as high as 1 7/8 and 4 large number of Anglo-Egyptians
                        have been induced to put their capital into the company. The reasons, for
                        which the extraordinary meeting for the 2lat inst. has been convened appear
                        to have aroused some criticism, as the following letters will show. We may
                        mention that Mr. Thomas McClure who appends his signature to one the
                        letters, retired from the board early this year.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,</p>
                    <p>A crisis bas arrived in the affairs of the Egyptian Constractious Limited and
                        much, if not all, depends on the decision which the shareholders will take
                        at the extraordinary general meeting to be held on Satarday week, the 21st
                        inst. At the beginning of this year the company was in a most flourishing
                        condition and had excellent prospects, During the months that have elapsed a
                        great amount of work has been carried out and, presumably, paid for.
                        Nevertheless the shareholders find that the present Board of Directors has
                        thought fit to convene this meeting for the purpose of disposing of those
                        branches of the basiness, which.are actually carrying on the work of the
                        company. All shareholders ought therefore to insist on s strict
                        investigation of the business carried ont during the present year, They also
                        should look into the conditions, ander which the business has been éarried
                        out, and the disposal of the large sums of money received. I am, Sir, </p>
                    <p>Truly yours</p>
                    <p>Tuomas McClure</p>
                    <p>Alexandria, 10th December.</p>
                    <p>Sir,</p>
                    <p>Referring to the notice convening an extraordipary general meeting of the
                        Egyptian Constructions, Limited, for the reduction of capital, oce is amazed
                        that any directors shonld place sach proposals before a presamably
                        intelligent body of shareholders. Not only did they give us only a few
                        months ago a most glowing account of the fature prospects of the associated
                        businesses, but pointed out the undoubtedly aniqae position the company held
                        in the building and engineering trades owing to the sequisition of two
                        private concerns. Without a farther word of explanation the shareholders are
                        now asked to authorise a sweeping reduction of capital and the resale
                        (probably at an enormous loss) of the businesses which were going to do so
                        much for the company. Surely, before submitting such proposals the board
                        should have given some statement of account and the reasons for the step
                        they propose? Do-they want to rush their proposals through without
                        explanation or discussion? In the present deplorable position of the company
                        the shareholders should be in possession of full details for their very
                        careful consideration before being asked to arrive at any decision. We
                        shareholders are pleased at the opportunity of meeting the board and
                        enquiring as to the truth of the many anpleasant ramoors being circulated
                        about the company and its management, and to the effect that even if the
                        board's resolutions are carried, the company will be left without working
                        capital. It is certainly esseotial that the shareholders should pull to-
                        gether in this matter by attending the meeting in fall force and appointing
                        some of their nomber to investigate the position, and after discussion with
                        the directors report to the shareholders as to the best course to
                        pursue.</p>

                    <!-- Sections of OCR were missing -->
                    <p>(From Travelling Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>No more voyage could have been made than the trip from Marseilles to Egypt by
                        the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co's "Heliopolis". It has had indeed been to us a
                        City of the Sun, for from start to finish we have been entertained with a
                        liberality which the most exacting must have heartily appreciated. We have
                        had a splendid run, kept well up to time, and throughout the voyage lived in
                        the lap of luxury. In fact everybody was most enthusiastic in their praise
                        of the "Heliopolis," whose maiden voyage must be voted a complete success.
                        The day before leaving Marseilles a lunch was given on board to the
                        notabilities of the town and its suburbs. Some 150 guests sat down to table,
                        among whom I noticed the Prefet of the Department du Rhone, the General
                        Commanding the Corps d'Armee, the Governor of Marseilles, all the Consular
                        Corps, with the exception of the German Consul, the it leading shipowners
                        and merchants of the town, and many other well-known local people. Boghos
                        Pasha Nubar took the chair and gave us a most interesting speech in which he
                        explained how the company had come to be ed. The founders of the company had
                        for the past few years the development of senger traffic across the seas and
                        had especially attracted, a4 has all the world, by the marvellous Atlantic
                        service which exists to-day. But why shoald the Atlantic have the monopoly ?
                        And, moreover, fast steamers had been running across the Atlantic for
                        several years now, whereas the Mediterranean service had continued its
                        jog-trot speed of a comparatively few knots per hour The company was formed,
                        its first two boats were built, and the maiden voyage was now being made by
                        one of the vessels which would place Mediterranean steamer traffic on a
                        level with the Atlantic.</p>
                    <p>We left Marseilles at 1.30 p.m. on Saturday but the first day's ron was
                        rather unsatisfactory, owing, I am told, to bad stoking. Up to midday on
                        Saturday we made 395 knots. following day's run, however, was 456 knots, and
                        between midday Monday and midday yesterday we covered 458 knots, thus
                        leaving us 89 knots to ras, and this we did in four hours, for it was at 4
                        p.m. that the engines were stopped just outside Alexandria harbour to await
                        the pilot. In considering these runs it must be remembered that, owing to
                        the change of time, Sunday to Monday midday was not 24 hours but 28b. 10
                        min. and Monday to Tuesday 23h. 26 min.</p>
                    <p>Before conclading this little account of our trip I should like to mention
                        that many are the souvenirs which have been left behind io the form of
                        appreciative letters, etc. among whom I would mention contributions by such
                        wellknown persons as Mr. Maurice Barrts, of the Academie Francaise, Mr.
                        Georges Kaiser, Mr. Paul Adam, Mr. Jules Haret, Mr. Pierre Baudin, Mr. J.
                        Verdier, Mr. J MacRichard Mr. Jean d'Ardenne, Mr. Gustave Tery and Mr.
                        Sidney Low, who has come ont to Egypt to write a book on the country. The
                        following was his contribution :— </p>
                    <p>How fair, how faint, across the years, The City of the Sun appears, How oft
                        she danced before our eyes, Beyond the buried centuries ! Superb in
                        history's glowing pages, Home of the gods, the priests, the mages, The
                        pictured stones bring back to us, The Vision of Heredotus !</p>
                    <p>A mocking vision, so we ssid, A vanished world !an Egypt dead ! Ah no ! She
                        rises from the earth, Incarnate in a later birth, And we may see the sunrise
                        kiss A greater Heliopolis.</p>
                    <p>But ancient fables, in our days, Fulfil themselves in wondrous ways, How of
                        the fairy stories tell Of cities floating on the swell Of moving islands,
                        drifting free, Across the heaving wastes of sea ! Well now the tale is true
                        again ; The moving isle is on the main.</p>
                    <p>No thing of post's gossamer, But twelve good thousand tons of her ; Palace
                        and town and house and street, With iron hungs, that breathe and beat, The
                        City of the Sun, once more, Wings her swift way to Egypt's shore, And bears
                        us through the Middle Sea, In Cleopatra's luxury ; Bears us from Northern
                        fog and frost, To that enchanted summer cosst, Our Island of the Bleet she
                        is, The great ship "Héliopolis."</p>
                    <p>S.S. Heliopolis, at Sea.</p>
                    <p>SIDNEY LOW.</p>
                    <p>Dec. 9, 1007.</p>
                    <p>I have also captured the attached anonymous suggestion to the company :—"Some
                        disappointment has been caused among lady passengers by the fact that their
                        cabins are not provided with curling-tongs. We underthat owing to a
                        regrettable error on the part of a subordinate a very limited supply of
                        these useful articles was shipped, and these are all required for the use of
                        the band. We believe, however, that the Captain has kindly offered to place
                        his own private set at the disposal of any lady who may have forgotten to
                        bring her own own. Application should be addressed to the third officer,
                        accompanied by a lock of the applicant's own hair, if she has any." Needless
                        to say a speedy reply came to the effect that the third officer anxiously
                        awaited applications.</p>
                    <p>I must add that we had the advantage of receiving the latest news from
                        marconigram stations which were served up as an hors d'æuvre at the
                        breakfast table.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Norman Hamilton, of the "Daily Express" and "Standard," who was a
                        passenger <cb n="5"/> by the "Heliopolis" sends us the following:-- Staring
                        me in the face on a raw, foggy November day in the big wooden open space
                        opposite Aldwych theatre, I saw the now famous picture of an Arab chieftain
                        with his hand shading his eyes, gazing across a sapphire sen sparkling with
                        an Eastern sun, on a magnificent steamer in the distance. It was this
                        picture that drew me like a magnet from London, and visions of past journies
                        to Pharaoh land and of lazily moving dahabeabs moving up the Nile whisked me
                        for moment to Mena House and the Pyramids like the magic carpet. For twenty
                        years I have heard the East "a-calling" but never with such an imperatively
                        insistent tone, and November 30th found me at Plymouth aboard the new
                        steamer "Heliopolis." Prepared as I was for a surprise, having heard much of
                        the new Egyptian Steamship Co. and having travelled on over forty of the
                        world's ocean caravanserai lines, the "Heliopolis" for luxury, taste, and
                        comfort, was a surprise and pleasure. </p>
                    <p>Accustomed as one is to the splendour of the American lines,as an old Eastern
                        "voyageur" it must be yielded that the travelling public owe a great debt of
                        gratitude to this new line, chiefly on account firstly of its great speed of
                        20 knots, which brought us to Marseilles in 96 hours, in place of the usual
                        6 days, secondly, its brilliant café restaurant under the able command of
                        Monsieur Gelardi (of Claridges), and thirdly a band of really excellent
                        Italian musicians and what is more fine vocalists as well.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday November 30th the new line received its baptism of passengers and
                        started on its maiden voyage under the command of Captain Holloway R.N.R. a
                        thorough mariner, and gentleman, whose kindly unaffected manners made us one
                        and all his friends. The absence of any but trifling hitches on the first
                        voyage not merely of a brand new ship but belonging as she does to a brand
                        new line, was remarkable and caused great interest in the future doings of
                        this enterprising company.</p>
                    <p>To myself, a hardened traveller, the most pleasing feature, duo I believe to
                        Mr. G. T. Symons the Managing Director and Capt. Creighton, to whom is very
                        largely due the perfect "tout ensemble" and absence of jarring note, is the
                        cutting adrift from the old British policy of catering for Britain only and
                        right pleased was I to see the right note struck by the management at
                        Marseilles by inviting at "déjeuner" the "elito" of Marseilles and even some
                        distinguished Parisienne chiefs among whom was the Prefect himself. This
                        function undoubtedly gave great pleasure and some surprise to our French
                        friends and was a most tactful and astute move, for the "Heliopolis" and
                        "Cairo" will be the guest of France which is their European terminus.</p>
                    <p>I must not forget the café, a new and enjoyable feature on this splendid
                        ocean palace. Passengers can dine or lunch here and are allowed 1/6, 2/6 and
                        3/6 for breakfast, dejenner, and dinner respectively, can invite each other
                        to little parties for dinner which with music added of a refined character
                        form charming interludes on the voyage to Egypt. No wonder we saw joining us
                        at Marseilles a number of French and other passengers, a compliment indeed
                        to a British steamer, for they invariably travel by Pronoh and German
                        steamers and rarely under the blue ensign.</p>
                    <p>The journey ended on Tuesday December 10th by a record trip from Marseilles
                        of a little over three days.</p>
                    <p>The arrival of the "Heliopolis" yesterday afternoon attracted to the quay
                        hundreds of people, some of whom waited a weary three hours and more to get
                        aboard. The long time which it took to bring the vessel alongside the quay
                        was doubtless due to the facts that the harbour is very congested, turbine
                        steamers are practically unknown to our port, and, thirdly, it is, we
                        believe, the largest vessel that has been brought alongside. The delay,
                        therefore, should be pardoned ; indeed Bakhry Bey should be congratulated on
                        the way in which he handled the mammoth liner. When the ship was moored
                        chaos prevailed. Hundreds were waiting to get aboard, some of whom had to
                        meet passengers but most of whom had come to see the ship, but orders were
                        given that nobody was to be allowed aboard until the passengers were ashore.
                        The crowd protested forcibly, a few succeeded in wriggling their way past
                        the police, and finally the gangway was stormed and all came aboard. Never
                        had such a ship been seen in Alexandria harbour before, so Alexandrians vied
                        with each other in being the first aboard. The police's task was an im-
                        possible one and we must congratulate them upon the way in which they
                        conducted their work.</p>

                    <p>The balance sheet us at June 30 last shows that the mining and general
                        expenditure account for the year amounted to £21,875 or, after the deduction
                        of transfer fees, &amp;c., a net sum of £21,882. In addition, an outlay of
                        £5, 177 on buildings, machinery, and plant, and rolling stock, and £787 on
                        surface and mine works was incurred. The superintendent's report sets on in
                        detail the work accomplished, and the results achieved during the twelve
                        months. A gratifying featore in this connection is the fact that nearly
                        1,000ft, of sinking and driving in excess of that for the previous year is
                        recorded, the figures to the 30th June, 1907, being 4,639 ft. as against
                        3,686ft, for the corresponding period to the 30th June, 1906.</p>

                    <p>Aden. December 4.</p>
                    <p>The Mecca Commission has left Hodeida for Mecca, and upon its departure the
                        last hope of effecting a friendly settlement with the rebels is generally
                        believed to have gone. The Turkish Pashas, who have been for more than two
                        months in Yemen, are still at Hodeida, and will probably stay for some time
                        there, though it is doubtful whether they will be able to do any appreciable
                        good. I have recently met one who accompanied the Mecca Commission, and he
                        confirmed what I have written regarding it. A remarkable feature in the
                        Imam's reply was the religious title of Commander of the Faithful, which he
                        affixed to his name and to which strong exception was taken by the
                        Commission. It is assumed that this will be the last Peace Commission of
                        Yemen for some time now Such Commissions are merely a waste of public money.
                        I have more than once asserted in your columns that the real object of the
                        Imam is supremacy and that anything short of complete autonomy will not
                        satisfy him. As regards the Yemen deputation which went to Copstantinople,
                        it is stated that a meeting was held at Sana, under the presidency of
                        General Faizi Pasha, which was attended by the said deputation and the
                        citizens at Sana and others. At this meeting expressions of the good
                        feelings and sympathy of the Sultan were conveyed to the people of Yemen and
                        General Faizi Pasha made a speech exhorting tho people to be loyal to the
                        Sultan.</p>

                        <p>As soon as the present feverish activity prevailing at Port Sudan comes
                            to an end and all the Government buildings are erected, it is very
                            probable that the town wilk, lose a large number of its civilian

                            stagnancy awaiting the development of the Sudan. In. the town and its
                            neighbourhood there is nothing to attract a resident population except
                            the desire of making money speedily. The climate is extremely hot and
                            damp during the greater part of the year, Beyond the town stretches a
                            dreary plain with only mimosa thorns for vegetation. The horizon is
                            bounded by the desolate. Hadendowa mountains ten miles away. There are

                            money-making, and as soon as the Government. contracts run out and there
                            is no further need for European labour, the population: will inevitably

                        <p>It was thonght by the enthusiastic supporters of the scheme that the new
                            town would be able to successfully compete with Suakim, but the old Red

                            waiting. The great advantage of Suakim is that it has large and most
                            fertile areas of country to the South, which is rapidly developing into
                            the most important, cotton producing centre in the Sudan. Port Sudan on

                        <p>The Government consider that. if a line of railway was brought from
                            Kassala to the Nile- Red Sea Line, all the Kassala trade will be brought
                            to Port Sudan, But it mast be remem- bered that all the traders with
                            Kassala reside in Saakim and they will do their utmost to bring dl that
                            trade to Snakim. The Govern- ment do not appear to reilise the
                            intensitey of the feeling, which binds the Suakimese to their old bome.
                            Why should they be so foulish as to leave their native town for Port
                            Sudan, whose prospects are, after all, somewhat visionary ss far as the
                            immediate future is concerned? If the native trader were to leave Suakim
                            he would lose all the value of his large comfortable house there, which
                            would remain empty, in order to dwell in the wooden shanties of Port
                            Sudan. Trade rontes are ever conservative and Suakim will long continue

                            whom are natives.</p>
                        <p>What then is to be the outlook for Port Sudan? We are of opinion that the
                            only outlook in the immediate,future must be one of patient resignation,
                            say tor the next ten years, antil the Sadan makes some substantial pro-
                            gress. The vast irrigation-works necessary for the «development of the
                            Sudan have not yet begun and they will take many years to complete. The
                            country, depopulated by the excesses of the Dervishes, has to await the
                            coming of new generations to fill up the voids made by their massacres.
                            All this will take time and it is childish to expect any im- mediate
                            results, But as soon as this develop- ment begins to bear fruit, the
                            effect will be at once evident in Port Sadan, whose harbour will
                            increast in importance with the growth of Sudanese exports. To expect
                            that it is to at once spring intoexistence as a flourishing harbour is
                            absard, especially in a cogntry sit- uated as the Sudan is, for its
                            fatdre is necessarily bound up withthe devélopment of a very slowly
                            moving country. But although Port Sadan has many years of stagnant
                            expectation and of hope deferred betore it, thete is every reason to
                            believe that it will ultimately justify its existence.</p>

                    <p>THE COPTS AND NATIONALISTS.</p>
                    <p>All the efforts of the Moslem Nationalists to induce the Copts to join them
                        in political agitation have »been fruitless, The Coptic point of view. is
                        well expressed in "Al Watan", the Cairo Coptic organ, which makes the
                        followingcomment on the Nationalistic leaders and their real aims :—</p>
                    <p>We have never doubted for a moment that personal ends and religions motives
                        were at the bottom of everything, done or said by these journalists who are
                        supposed to be the leaders of political parties in Egypt. Mustafa Kamel goes
                        to.the extreme end and pushes forward as hard as be can, because, he can
                        find no other means for living. Were he to as certain now that a show of
                        moderation would increase his income or enhance his fame he would become as
                        moderate aa you like to-morrow. So are Sheikh Ali and his supporters
                        counselling moderation and denouncing the extreme party because it pays them
                        better to do so now. When they find it in their parsonal interest to be
                        wildly extreme in their criticism of the present regime they will not
                        hesitate a moment in outatepping even the bounds of "Al-Lewa" in their
                        frenzied denunciation. They have done this on many: an occasion and they are
                        most willing to do so whenever they think it better for their pockets. In
                        fact they bave no natural or real feelings except such as they expressed
                        aften the Denshwaa incident and snoh as "Al- Lewa" has been always evincing
                        in these years. Perhaps our readers will remember that we foresaw the right
                        thing early this year when we explained that by mutual arrangement or by
                        common inspiration our presen day moderates were to cool down and leave the
                        honour of permanent heat in the boatile cam- paign against the British rule
                        to "Al-Lewa"' for some time. We have now full evidence that our suspicions
                        were well founded and that the moderation of these "comrades" is at the best
                        untrue.</p>
                    <p>Take their attitude towards Christians in general and Copts in particular, as
                        an example of their patriotism and you will find that re- ligious fanaticism
                        is the suin-aod-essence of all their politics and all the doings of their
                        dives. Both the extreme and the moderate leaders have been calling upon the
                        Copts of late to join their parties and pretending: the most innocent desire
                        to see Moslems and Copts united as Egyptians to defend the common in
                        terests. The leader of the extreme wing re- cently hired certain nobedies
                        among the Copts to say that they are his faithfal follow ers. He eve
                        invented Coptic names for some of his fabricated letters on this swbject.
                        Yet the slightest provocation of the old prejudice or of the dominating
                        fanaticism will speedily unmask these patriots and make them let the cat out
                        of the bag as they have done in ctwo cases of recent date.</p>
                    <p>One of the two cases above referred to was that of Salib Bey Claudios, a most
                        capable and trasworty servant of the Postal Administration who was lately
                        promoted to a high position. Salib Bey is almost without equal in his
                        serious and straightforward performance of duties and in the wide range of
                        his acquirements and experience. He has gained this belated recognition of
                        his services by the inevitable right of seniority and the unrivalled record
                        of his services. Yet because he happens to be a Christian and a Copt his
                        promotion was bitterly criticised in "Al-Lewa" and "Al-Moayad", both editors
                        well knowing that Salib Bey was far soperior in all the requirements of his
                        new post to any of the friends they would bave apoointed in his place.</p>
                    <p>The second case refers to the omdeh of Deirout, a village in Upper Egypt.
                        That dignitary was some days ago relieved of his duties and a notable Copt
                        eslected to fill his piece, Of course, the new omdel was not selected on
                        aceount of his religion, for s Copt ie likely to lose rather than gain on
                        that account nowadays. But ovr moderate and sincere friend "Al Moayed" could
                        not hide his great disappoint- ment although the ease was hardly worthy of
                        his great seal. He poured his venom unreser- vedly in critizing the
                        appointment of a <cb n="3"/> Christian omdeh end threw the mask of mo-
                        deration to the <!-- illegible -->. He has only shown his real metal this
                        time and proved once again to all and sundry that toleration and moderation
                        mean absolutely nothing to him. Like his rival of "Al Lewa," he is a
                        dangerous agitator and a fanatic of the <!-- illegible --> species. And we
                        profoundly regret to say, the principles and purposes of these rivals are
                        shared by millions.</p>

                        ranks third on the list of competing countries. It will aise be observed

                        353.397.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of interest we may mention that in 1897 the total imports were,
                        L.E. 129,000, whereas for the first nine months of the present year the
                        figures were L.E. 279,491. These latter returns, by the way, show an in-
                        crease Of L.E. 54.000 over the same period in 1906, so we are still on the
                        upward movement. For Austria to have almost a monopoly of the Egyptian ready
                        made clothing trade, it is obvious that there must be gome exceptional
                        feature in her favour. As far-as we can gather, such factor lies not, as one
                        might. expect, in having large up-to-date factories with all the latest
                        machinery, put rather in her very cheap labour.</p>
                    <p>Briefly but, the system appears to be for the goods to be cut out in the
                        factory and then given to contractors (or, as they are termed, master
                        tailors) for completion. These men in torn-either ran small workshops in
                        which ap- prentice labour is mainly employed, or they give the sewing ont to
                        the peasants-in: the vil- lages, especially during the winter months The
                        rules—which are upheld by the State— of the Tailors' Guilds re apprentices
                        greatly assist the above mentioned master tailors in turning out the goods
                        with the least possible expense. It appears that before a man can commence
                        in business as a tailor on his own account, he must have served at least
                        four years as an apprentice (during which he receives merely his board and
                        ledging) and about sight years as an improver at a very small wage. It is no
                        exaggeration to say that a large amount of the work on ready made clothing
                        is done by apprentices and improvers.</p>
                    <p>Another feature in favour of Austria is the fact that the trade in Egypt is
                        more or less in the hands of three or four big firms, which have houses in
                        Vienna and so import direct. They have their own branches in the larger
                        Egyptian towns, and we understand, some of them are also interested in the
                        smaller clothing shops in the villages. The combination is so strong that,
                        although both England and Germany have at- tempted to get a footirg the
                        efforts they have made in this direction have so far been unsuc cessful.</p>
                    <p>It must also be remembered that, for the last 40 or 50 years Austria has been
                        in the Egyptian clothing trade and she, therefore, thoroughly understands
                        the-reqairements of the market. Her Government, too, encourages the industry
                        as far as possible by waiving all import-duties on materials. brought into
                        the country and afterwards exported in the form of clothing. The main centre
                        for the trade in, Austria is Vienna with some 3% villages in the neighbour:
                        hood After the goods are finished they are packed for export ip strong:
                        wooden cases, each some 1.20 metres (47 inghes) long by 1 metre (89 inches)
                        high, and costing about 5/6. The cases (which are sometimes lined with
                        water- proof paper) usuglly contain clothes to the value of abont L.E. 100.
                        The freight and in- suranos from Vienna to Alexandria, may be reckoned at
                        something like 2% or 3% of the cost, ahd a further 10% to 11% must be added
                        for quay duties, landing charges, customs and clearing expenses, and
                        cartage, to shop or warehouse.</p>

                        wherever it, goes. That is why more and more people use it every year.</p>

                    <p>The croiser "Diana," Captain H.S. Grant, which has taken up the duties of
                        senior naval officer's ship on. the Egyptian coasts, has put in one half of
                        ber two year commission. The Diana's new commission was probably the cause
                        of her failing off in gunnery this year Last year she was third in the
                        return of the Méditerranean Fleet, but this year she will not occupy so high
                        a place according to a semi- official statement.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant F. Carne Rasch, the senior sub. of the 6th Dragoon Guards, Mhow,
                        who has been selected for service with the Egyptian Army, entered the Essex
                        Regiment, in 1901, and transferred from the Pompadoers to the Carabiniers in
                        September, 1903. Curiously his father, Sir Frederick Carne Rasch, Bart, M
                        P., served in the Pompadours and in the Carabi niera. Mr. Rasch went through
                        the Transvaal operations of 1901-02 with the Exsex Regiment's 1st Battalion
                        (Queen's medal with five clasps)</p>
                    <p>Another selection for the Egyptian Army is that of Lieutenant P.M. Larken,
                        Army Service Corps, London. This officer got his Comminsion directly into
                        the Army Service Corps in January, 1902.</p>
                    <p>In naval circles it is stated that no further reductions are to be made in
                        any of the squadrons sérving abroad.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the German budget deficit will have a powerful influence
                        on the shipbuilding programme of that country</p>
                    <p>By the departare of the 3rd Battalion Wor- ceatershire Regiment for the Cape,
                        the Alder- shot command has lost its best shooting batta- lion. twas the
                        magnificent musketry record of the 3nd Battalion, and the good record of the
                        4th Battalion, now in Malta, which saved both from sbolition when "reform"
                        swept the docks recently.</p>
                    <p>No more is to be heard of the Seott ford incident. There is a general feeling
                        that both admirals were wrong, and that it would be better to let the thing
                        drop into the limbo specially reserved for such incidents, It will, however,
                        not be the fault of some old salts if the incident will not be one of the
                        pegs on which itis proposed to hang the mach talked of inquiry into the
                        efficiency of the Royal Navy</p>
                    <p>Those pessimists who are always crying out about the decadence of Britixh
                        naval supre macy very often do more harm than good to the causethey would
                        sepport by the eternal ery of "wolf". For instance, it has been stated that
                        we are on the eve ot being swamped in the matter of Dreadhoughts by Germany
                        and France, not to mention the United States. A close research into the
                        qgeetion shews that according to our present naval programme Great Britain
                        will have a fieet of four Dread noughts, and three Invincible creisers in
                        being before Germany has a single Dreadrought <floatingText>

                    <p>The new route to Khartoum has evoked considerable interest in England and is
                        being noticed by the London press, as the following extract from "The Globe"
                        will show:-- The inauguration of a mail steamship service between Egypt and
                        the Sudan, through the Red Sea, implies more than a new route to Khartoum,
                        important as this is of itself. The line started by the Khedivial Mail Com
                        pany, in agreement jointly with the Egyptian Government and the Sudan
                        Administration, may, in fact, be regarded as resolve to prevent the
                        Italianining of the Red Sea Coast and its trade. There was some fear of this
                        when negotiations began a year ago between the Italian Government and the
                        Rubattino Company of Conor for a monthly mail service between Italy,
                        Northern Egypt, and the Red Sea porta right down the coast from Suez to
                        Djibouti.</p>
                    <p>The scheme, however, encountered lively opposition from the Italian colony of
                        Erythrea, whose sense of dignity and of material welfare was injured by the
                        proposal from Rome and Genoa that the mail steamers should serve
                        intermediate ports. For a time it was thought that the representations of
                        the colony would I prevail, but the Italian Government has evidently refused
                        to take this parochial view of Italian commerce, and it is now announced
                        that the 1 first mail steamer from Genoa, Naples, and Messina will sail from
                        Suez on December 8, touching at Port Sudan, anong other intermediate places.
                        It was clearly incumbent to preserve British and Anglo Egyptian interests
                        along the African cost especially; these interests, and the development of
                        trade dependent on them, are assured by the weekly mail service of the two
                        16 knot steamers, "Prince Abbas" and "Al Kahirs."</p>
                    <p>The journey between Khartoum, and the Red Sea takes twenty hours, and the
                        combined services the result in a saving of twenty-four hours over the
                        fastest time by train along the Nile Valley, while having the political
                        advantage of being an all British route. This is further more secured in the
                        Mediterranean by the P. and 0. Brindisi service, or by the new British
                        turbine line between Marseilles and Alexandria. By either way Khartoum is
                        now brought within nine days distance of London. There is another important
                        aspect of the case. The Nile Red Sea railway in bow brought for almost the
                        first time into really Imperial use.</p>

                    <p>MRS. MAHALA REID, Corbyville, Ont., Canada, writes:</p>
                    <p>"Your celebrated remedles have been a wanderful boon to me in my old age.</p>
                    <p>"I have not been in so good health for soveral years as now. I was troubled
                        with constipation, pheumatism and kidney trouble.</p>
                    <p>"A little over two years ago, I com- pletely lost my health, becoming al-
                        most helpless, when a dear friend sent me your remedles, Perunasad Manalo. I
                        began to take them, following the direetions on the bottle. I very soon
                        began to feel benefited by thefr use and continued to take them.</p>
                    <p>"I am now completely recovered from the above ailments, in fact, better than
                        I have been for years past. I cannot praise the remedies too highly and will
                        always recommend them to others."</p>
                    <p>Constipation is almost sure to set up other derangements. </p>
                    <p>Retained accumulations within the bowels are partly resbaorbed into the
                        gyeters, producing sometimes rheuma- tism, sometimes kidney trouble.</p>
                    <cb/>
                    <p>The blood being surcharged with acids, which ordinarily find their esape
                        through the bowels when they are regular, rheumatism is the result.</p>
                    <p>Acid blood forms eryatals, which ac- cumulate about the ligaments, carti-</p>
                    <p>lages and sometimes the bones in the joints.</p>
                    <p>Such morbid accumalations of blood throw extry work upon the kidneys. The
                        kidneys being unable to perform the unusual labor of exereting these
                        poisona, ofton give way and kidney trouble is the result.</p>
                    <p>Permanent relief cannot be resnona- bly expected excaps by correcting the
                        constipation.</p>
                    <p>Regular bowels are a great safe- guard to health. Peruna and Manalin are
                        unexcelled the world over for chronic diseases affecting the bowels and
                        kidneys. </p>

                    <p>"I suffered for twenty-six yeara with bladder snd kidsey trouble, and being
                        advised to give Peruna a trial, I did so. Eight botter of Peruna and three

                        <p>Sir,—Having just returned to Cairo from a holiday trip up the Nile on
                            Messrs T. Cook and Son's S.S. "Rameses" I cannot resist the temptation
                            to write a few words in honest praise of the excellent arrangements
                            which were made by that firm for our comfort both on board and on the

                            treatment we all receiyed from Cook's employés will be of general
                            interest and especially 80 to those tourists who contemplate making the
                            Nile trip this season.</p>
                        <p>The antiquities and scenery are continually being admired and written
                            about, and why should we overlook the merits of the agency which enables
                            us to travel in luxoriant ease from the farthest corner of the globe to
                            see these works of nature and man, which otherwise we should never

                        <p>Sir,-- I quite agree with both "Lex" and "Vigilant" as to the urgent
                            necessity of amending the English Companies Acts, so as to ensure the
                            power of rendering effective its penal clauses. But they seem to have
                            lost sight of a still greater peril and that is the unlimited power of
                            voting given to large shareholders. One often reads of the apathy of
                            shareholders in defending their interests. But what encouragement is
                            there to a shareholder to act when be knows that one or two big
                            shareholders can, and often do, if it suits them, overide the interests
                            of numerous small holders of shares.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the shareholders' consent is necessary to any expenditure
                            involving an increase of capital; but, there again, for the reason I
                            have given, they would be baulked, if they presumed to oppose such a
                            measure.</p>
                        <p>It may be objected that any limitation of voting power could be
                            circumvented by a big holder splitting up his shares. Truly ; but this
                            would be, morally speaking, a fraud and an evasion of the spirit of the
                            Law; it should, consequently, entail the confiscation of such
                            shares.</p>
                        <p>Yours truly,</p>

                    <head>A REVIEW OF A GREAT INDUSTRY (1742- 1907.)</head>
                    <p>Sheffield is probably the principal city in the world sg regards
                        silver-plated work ; in fact, something like 100 tons of silver plate are
                        produced there every year.</p>
                    <p>The processs of Sheffield plating, which has been renowned for a century and
                        a half on account gf ite darability, was originally discovered throagh an
                        accident by Thomas Bolsover about the year 1742, the component parts being
                        copper and silver, but as is eee case.with the originators of a great idea,
                        he did not realise the momertoos importance of lis discovery and it was
                        reserved for a Mr. Hancock to utilise the principle, and show the great
                        advantages to which copper, plated in this few method, could be applied. He
                        atilised it forthe working of sack kinds of domestic ware and table
                        decorations which ap to that period had been exclasively made in silver, viz
                        :—tea urns, ton sets, epernes, salvers, spoons, forks, &amp;e. The
                        execellency of the manafactore is proven by the fact that many pieces of
                        plate made between the year 1742 and 1762 are still in existence, showing
                        practically little signs of usage. Originally the copper was plated on one
                        side only; but in later years, meats were found to enable the plater tocoat
                        the copper in both sides, and such perfection did this art of Sheffield
                        plating sttain, tht it was celebrated throaghout the known world Previous to
                        1784 it was illegal to stamp any sign or letters apon an article of silver
                        plate under a penalty of £100 but owing to inferior articles comipg on the
                        market, it beeame necessary for high-class makers to protest themselves sod
                        their goods stamped withs significant omrk under which their initials were
                        invariably placed. For ins tance, at the botten of a miver might be stamped
                        a Lion, with the initials "A.B." beneath, probably representing strength,
                        and made by Albert Brown ; so all goods of Albert Brown's manufacture would
                        be thes stamped. This, of urea, was @ primitive form of advertining. The
                        process of maenfactare was slow, neater ally expensive, and consequently
                        there arose a demand for a more expeditions form of production, and, as
                        necessity brings invention, ao after period of 100 years, namely, about
                        1845, came the introduction of electro plating, which instantly
                        revolutionined the system ot manufacturing Sheffield pine; for whilst in the
                        old process the platér-produced the feet, handles, &amp;e at a great cost of
                        time out of solid sheets of silver, supported by scifer, and fastened so
                        that silver was onlt to view and wear, it the new system, the article was
                        placed in a bath, the silver deposited by au electrical process, and the
                        manual laboor thus saved, prodaced the desired result. Im- mediately, the
                        trade advanced by leaps snd bounds ; factories of every description sprang
                        up, giving employment to thousands of per- sons, another great industry was
                        added to the long role owning discovery to the creative genius of the Anglo
                        Saxon race, Naturally there were at once, good bad, and indifferent
                        mandfacturers and the necessity again arose for these whe desired to be
                        knows ae The producers af the highest class of goods, to stamp their mark
                        open the articles they produced.</p>
                    <p>One of the leading firme whe ere now manu- factoring electro plate at
                        Sheffield, is :—- The Association of Diamond Merchants, Jewellers, and
                        Silversmiths, Limited, whose London ad-- dress is Trafalgar Square, and who
                        have always prodaced the highest ideals in elegance of desing, heaviest
                        deposit of silver, and highest quality and finish ; on this account they are
                        therefore justly celebrated throughout the world, and to distizigaish their
                        goods from all other wakers, they plsce upon each article their Registered
                        Mark "A.D M. Sheffield Al" which is s gagrantee that the article is of the
                        highest quality. A spoott or fork stamped "A D M. Sheffield Al" therefore,
                        is guaranteed to wear for.30 years, and at the same time, the cost is only
                        half that of solid: silver, and wears equally as well. Doubtless the
                        majority of the readers of this paper are already well acquainted with the
                        world-wide reputation of this firm, bat should they be desirous of
                        purchasing from a local tradesman or ordering through a ship per, any
                        articles of "Sheffield" Plate it ix abso- lutely negessary to insist that
                        the article bears the Registered Stamp. Imitation is the sin cerest form of
                        flattery, and it is a very lucrative business to copy an article of the
                        highest quality in a cheaper plate, and charging the price of the
                        former.</p>
