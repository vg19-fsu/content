                    <head>THE GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE. </head>
                    <p>The year 1877 is one of the most memorable in the history of Bagland. It did
                        not witness any Constitutional crisis. There was no General Election, no
                        change of Government, no shifting of the centre of political power. The
                        domestic legislation of the year was singularity uneventful. The country had
                        only a second's interest in European wars. The course of commerce and
                        industry was equally free from critical events ; it was not a time of great
                        industrial disputes or of great mechanical inventions. The world was not
                        smitten by pestil. ence or famine. No great man was cut off by death in the
                        fullness of his power; if any leader of revolutions was born at that season
                        he bas Bow reached his thirtieth year without sign. Yet a single fact,
                        hardly noticed at the time, barely understood even now, make, the year 1877
                        pauk. as one of the turning points of national history, as the dramatic
                        close of a rëvolutionary era.</p>
                    <p>Between 1876 and 1877 the number of births per thousand of the total
                        population of England and Wales fell from 363 to 36. Por every ten tho sand
                        of the population tb.ee fawer children were born in 1877 than in 1876. The
                        birth rate had often varied more than this, upwards or downwards, in
                        previous years and has varied as much again and again ip anoceeding years.
                        The fact recorded might well seem utterly trivial and accidental. Subsequent
                        history has proved it to be neither. The last annual report of the
                        Registrar-General, which was issued a week or two ago, shows that the alight
                        fall in the birth rate between 1876 and 1877 was only the first stage in a
                        progressive decrease which has continued with but occasional intermission
                        ever since and which has brought the number of births per thousand persons
                        living down to 27:9 in 1904, the lowest recorded since the beginning of
                        registra|tion. Up to 1876 the birth rate, though subject to continual
                        variations, rose on the whole steadily throughout the period for which
                        stati{tics are available; from an average of 32 per thousand in the years
                        1841-45 it reached an average of 35-5 per thousand in the years 1871-75. It
                        attained its highest point in 1876, and then fell with catastrophic
                        swiftness. In less than ten years the increase of the previous. thirty-five
                        years disappeared ; in leşs than thirty the birth rate has come from 86-8 in
                        1876 to 27 9 in 1904—a fall of 23 per cent. Pew things in the vital history
                        of the nation are so dramatic as this slow rise and - rapid decline of its
                        fertility. Hardly any involves more important consequences or gives rise to
                        more serious speculations.</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>It is indeed easy, to overestimate, or rather to mistake, the effects of even
                        so great a decrease as one quarter in the fertility of the nation. First,
                        the falling English birth rate is no isolated phenomenon ; it is only a
                        single instance of a general tendepoy affecting substantially the-whole of
                        Western Barope. In Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Prance, Holland,
                        Belgium, Italy, and Hungary the birth rate has fallen markedly during the
                        past quarter of a century. In Austin, Switzerland, Russia, and Spaid it is
                        stationary. In Roumania and Bulgaria it has risen. In our Australasian
                        Colonies the fall has been even more marked than in the United Kingdom
                        itself. Second, the effects of a falling birth rate have been partially
                        counteracted by a fall in the death rate. In 1876 the death rate for England
                        and Wales was 209 per thousand persons living ; the difference between that
                        and the birth rate of 36.3, commonly described as the "natural increase" of
                        the population, was 15.4. In 1904 the birth rate I had fallen to 27.9, the
                        death rate to 16.2, and the "natural increase" to 11.7. Yet this way of
                        calculating the change, though it makes the actual drop in the rate of
                        natural increase, leaves it relatively to the earlier period I quite as
                        great. The rate of natural increase of the population: by excess of births
                        over deaths is just three quarters of what it was | less than thirty years
                        ago. That is the net result of our falling birth rate and of our enormously
                        improved sanitary and medical provision for keeping men alive.</p>
                    <p>The figures as given are vitiated by certain technical defects. Yet not the
                        most scientific of statisticians would deny the substantial validity of the
                        inference based on them. In a scientific paper read to the British
                        Association in 1894, Mr. Edward Cannan argued that the population of England
                        and Wales might be expected to become stationary during the last decade of
                        the Twentieth Century. The figures again must be left to speak for
                        themselves. No explanation can be offered here of the tremendous though
                        silent change of physical habits which has affected the whole Western world
                        during the last quarter of a century, whose beginning can be placed so
                        definitely for England in the years 1876-77. One thing at least seemscertain
                        : 80, complete and sudden a reversal of the earlier tendanoy must have been
                        due to very deep-seated opules, and is therefore hardly to be counteracted
                        by ordinary humanarta-by legislation or writing or preaching. It is not
                        clear whether the defense in the rate of national growth is a thing to be
                        blessed or one to be banned ; it is fairly clear that it matters but little
                        whether we bless or ban.</p>
                    <p>Por centuries preceding the Industrial Revolution at the end of the
                        Eighteenth Century the population of Bogland and Wales remained almost
                        stationary or grew at a rate utterly insignificant to modern eyes. In the
                        fifty years between 1750 and 1800, when the country first began to feel the
                        effects of the Industrial Revolution, the population increased by one-third.
                        In the next fifty years it doubled, and in the 6fty-five years since 1850 it
                        has almost, though not quite, doubled again. That is the outstanding feature
                        in the material history of the Nineteenth century. A tremendous outburst of
                        racial vigour, accompanying and stimulated by the development of mechanical
                        arts has in less than a hundred and fifty years replaced a Battered
                        agricultural community of seven millions by the crowded industrial community
                        of thirty-four millions which fills Bogland and Wales to-day. During all
                        this period tremendous growth of population and of all activities dependent
                        upon population-banofactores, export and import trade, cities,national
                        income. -has been taken as part of the natural order. When Mill in 1865
                        wrote his famous chapter on the "stationary state" in which population
                        should have ceased to grow he wrote as one imagining a fanciful paradox. Now
                        the stationary state—though its actoa) advent may be continually postponed
                        by improvements in the art of saving life is almost within sight; at least,
                        forces which may bring it about are working visibly in our midst. After a
                        contrary of ever swifter growth the forces of increase seem to have spent
                        themselves ; in 1877 the material history of the race turned a corner
                        suddenly. The growth of the modern nation may be destined to end with the
                        Twentieth Century as definitely as it began at the end of the
                        Eighteenth.</p>
                    <p>The effects of such a change both upon social life and apon political
                        speculation would be enormous. There appears to be no good reason for
                        looking forward to them as disastrous. The cessation of numerical growth in
                        Great Britain would not moan the cessation of pomerical growth in the
                        British Empire ; still lose would it involve the creation of all growth of
                        prosperity, of all development in human nature. The continual pressure of
                        the rising generation upon all the avenges of employment, which now drives
                        out many an older man before his time, would cease. The nation would have
                        sase from the pains of growing in bulk, and might tbus secure the more
                        universal distribution or prosperity and growth in other directions. In the
                        history of the race the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries would appear
                        simply as a time of tran-formation; the creation of violent growth would
                        leave the tranefortnéd people free to use its developed powers. (The

                            district of Western Guatemala, known as Pachon and said to be possessed
                            of special weevil-resisting characteristics. It is a short season

                            and texture. The rapid ripening tends, to leave the weevil without

                            of an eminently business-like character, though possessing few of the
                            ornaments with which his predecessors have generally striven to enliven
                            their figures. The conservative estimates formed by Mr. Austen

                    <head>THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY.</head>
                    <p>The Armenians were constituted into a recognised community by the Sultan of
                        Turkey about fifty years ago. It is stated that according to this
                        constitution, the members are empowered to elect the committee of their
                        community and the president is elected by the committee. It is stated that
                        Bartaa Pacha was not elected by the committee, but by the Patriarch of the
                        Armenians, Monsignor Ormanian, at Constantinople. Bartan Pasha is said to
                        have acted in too authoritative a manner as president and has filled up the
                        committee with his own nominees.</p>
                    <p>The tablet erected in the Armenian charoh by Bartau. Pacha was purposely
                        broken on Sunday last as a sign of the popular displeasure. The Pachs on
                        this tablet declared that he had spent L E. 350 on repairs to the church.
                        The fact that the amount of money spent by the Pacha was engraved on the
                        tablet caused displeasure because it was not considered good taste,
                        especially as the builder of the church, Youssefian Bey, a relation of Nabar
                        Pacha, never made such a display of his generosity to the community.</p>
                    <p>Another cause of complaint is that the president of the community should be a
                        local sobject, for in accordance with the constitution it is not in order,
                        so we are informed, to nomi| nate the subject of a foreign Power to such a
                        position, and Bartau Pasha is a Russian subject.</p>

                            and the following account of his Excellency's assertions is given in "Al
                            Lewa" :</p>
                        <p>On this question of the frontier dispute I am only giving - vent to the
                            wishes of my Imperial Master, the Sultan, and of his Govern. ment. The
                            Sublime Porte only wants what is just, so I do not think that any
                            further difficulties will occur over the present matter. The Ottoman
                            Government does not intend to make good its claims by foros, although
                            three Tarkish army corps numbering not less than 800,000 men, are now
                            encamped near the boundaries of Egypt. All those who are making
                            mountains out of molehills over this question are only working agar at
                            the interests of Turkey. Egypt, and England, and against the peace of
                            the world in general. Should the present state of affairs necessitate a
                            conference for the discussion of the difference, Turkey would, I
                            suppose, agree to sūch a step with pleasure for her objects are quite
                            pacific. If the Egyptians will accept my advice I should warn them to
                            pay not the slightest heed to the insults which some people are now
                            horling against their Sultan and his role in order to excite their
                            minds. Egypt's welfare demands perfect peace between the different sects
                            and races living here. The Ottomans appreciate the love and affection,
                            which the Egyptians bear towards their Suzerain Power and their
                            illustrious Saltın, and their loyalty should be 'founded on a desire for
                            peace and for the prosperity of Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As far as we can gather, all the news from the frontier confirms the
                            statements of the "Mokattam's" correspondent that Egyptian telegraph
                            poles have been appropriated and the boundary pillars demolished, and

                            Governor of El Areesh, had been originally prohibited from pursuing its
                            march by the Turkish commandant at Rafah, but when the leader of the
                            mission showed a certain document to the commandant it acted as an "Open
                            Sesame" and that officer at once put men at the service of the mission

                            fright at the approaching train, and dropped a case on the line, near
                            the junction. The train coming upon it exploded, hurling the engine
                            several yards away, killing the driver and fireman, and injuring three
                            more persons, one dangerously. Exact details are not to hand, but Mr.
                            Mandalay, the manager of the Luxor Assuan line, has left, accompanied by
                            the railway doctor, and a portion of the engineering staff. It is said
                            that the camel and driver have got off, and are not to be found.</p>
                        <p>The plague now raging at Deshna and environs is not what is known as
                            bubonic plague, but &amp; more virulent kind called pneumonic plague.
                            The chances of recovery are very méagre, when once the disease has got
                            hold of a patient. The authorities are taking every precaution. Dr.
                            Williams, who is in charge, is antiring in his efforts to stamp it out,

                            There was a good show of bunting, sundry speeches were made, and as is
                            usual on such occasions, healths were drunk ia lemonade and

                    <p>Port Said, Monday. </p>
                    <p>The S.S. Congal, which was sunk in March last year by the S.S. Statesman, and
                        which the Canal Company raised at a cost of £1,400 in Jane, was sold to a
                        syndicate for £3,500 and they in their turn resold her at a profit to a
                        Greek company, after having effected some slight repairs to her. Last Friday
                        morning she went to sea, and last night returned again in tow of the French
                        steamer Ville de Tamatave. The captain of the Ville stated that he sighted
                        the Congal early yesterday morning and arranged to tow her back to Port Said
                        for &amp; certain sam, which I understand the captain of the Congal denies.
                        The Congal is still anchored in the roads, and I have been unable to find
                        out the reason of her return.</p>

                    <head>THE NEW HISTORY OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>If any one should ask what necessity there was for yet another history of
                        ancient Egypt, added to the score already on our shelves, the answer is that
                        such books need renewal almost as often aq almanac and time-tables.The
                        extraordinary advance of discovery in Egypt, both in excavation of monuments
                        and in publication of texta, 'makes whole chapters obsolete in a very few
                        years. It seems only the other day that De Morgan and Petrie for the first
                        time set the dynasty of Menes on a solid foundation, and disclosed traces of
                        the earliest ages of Egyptian history previously unknown Every year the
                        patient labours of an increasing band of explorers bring fresh evidence to
                        light, and the no less patient studies of scholars at home reduce the vast
                        mass of material, new and old, to order and correlation. We shall never have
                        done with Rotissag the history of Egypt so long as there is an acre of
                        possible monumental sites to be dug up. All that we can demand is the
                        presentation of the latest evidence interpreted by accurate scholarship.
                        This we undoubtedly possess in Professor Breasted's learned work, the latest
                        product of the American school of research, which bids fair to rival the
                        best results of European scholarship. The Chicago professor is not content
                        to rely upon any secondary authority; he distracts copyists, however
                        eminent, and insisted upon going straight to the original documents himself.
                        This involved years of labour in the museums of Earope and Cairo, and among
                        the monuments still remaining in situ in Egypt. No doubt he has his own
                        personal equation of error; but his freali collation of nearly all the
                        existing historical documents has enabled him to eliminate numerous
                        misreadings and to produce a series of texts more accurate as a whole than
                        any published before. These appear in his "Ancient Records of Egypt," a
                        large collection of verified documents, upon which the present history is
                        based, and to which references are given in substantiation of most of his
                        statements. The | book is thus written mainly at first hand, and is
                        authoritative according to the mass of his materials and the measure of his
                        scholarship. Some exceptions might be taken to his general manner of
                        ignoring all previous research by other workers, but this is simply the
                        method of his history. He will allow no interpreter to come between him and
                        the original document, which he invariably examines for himself without bias
                        from others, and only after he has formed his own conclusions does he
                        compare the results of previous interpreters. This is unquestionably the
                        right way to set to work, as Professor Petrie has himself inflexibly laid
                        down ; and never before has the fall documentary evidence of Ezyptian
                        history bɔen brought together so completely or with simpler means of
                        verification.</p>

                        <p>Paris, May 1. A lieutenant in uniform harangued tha strikers at a meeting
                            here. He declared that his treatment in the army had made him a convert
                            to Socialism : he will not permit goldiers to shed the blood of their
                            comrade. He has been arrested.</p>

                        <p>Paris, May 1. The city is in an excited state. By eleven 150 persons had
                            been arrested for refusing to circulate. The crowd stoned Chatsapdeau
                            barracks : police charged and arrested them. Up to now no disturbances
                            have taken place in the provinces. It is estimated that 20,000 persons
                            have left Paris for fear of distarbanp89. * Many scoffil 3s between the
                            poliée and the demonstrators have taken place : the police were
                            repeatedly compelled to charge, and once, when stoned, they received
                            orders to fire in the air. The Place de la République was cleared by
                            cavalry but the troops and police were discreetly handled and few. were
                            hurt. 700 arrests were made, including the Germis Socialist delegates.
                            The demonstrations in the provinces passed off peacefully, rain aiding
                            the authorities.</p>

                        <p>Paris, May 1. Most of the shops are open, but the circulation of
                            carriages is very restricted. There is no animation, except in the
                            neighbourhood of the Bourse de Travail, where numerous meetings are
                            being held..</p>
                        <p>The police dispersed several gatherings. Several people were slightly
                            injured, and six or seven hundred arrests were made.</p>
                        <p>Telegrams from the departments do not report any serious incident. Some

                    <head>EVENING ENTERTAINMENT AT SHEPHEARD'S.</head>
                    <p>A most successful evening entertainment took place at Shephsard's Hotel on
                        Wednesday last. Unfortunately it was impossible to start at 9:30 punctually,
                        owing to the large dining hall being packed with visitors. Dinner over,
                        however, the place was quickly converted, the stage erected, hairs placed in
                        position, eto., and the audience soon filled the hall. A splendid programme
                        was then gone through, each performer receiving vociferous cheering. Major
                        Donegan, with his original song, fairly "brought down the house," as also
                        did Lieut. Adams and Mr. Trimen; in fact it is hardly fair to enlogise any
                        particular individual, as every one was such a sighsl 8000088. The.
                        sentimental singing of Mrs. Roussin, MA Hayes, and Mr. Wood left nothing to
                        be desired. The audience was treated to plenty of fun, which they greatly
                        appreciated, and all through the evening the hall resounded with roars of
                        hearty laughter.</p>
                    <p>The attendance was quite beyond expect:tions. The garrison was well
                        represented, General Bullock, Wation Pachs (A.D.C. to H.H. the Khedive) and
                        most of the officers of the Army of Occupation being prosent. Tha convert
                        was promoted in aid of the British Soldiers' and Sailors' Families
                        Association, and we trust financially it has been a BUCO888. We understand
                        that this was the first of a series of monthly entertainments, and can
                        assert that if the programmes of the forthcoming concerts are kept up to the
                        standard of this one, they cannot fail to be a 8000038: Great credit is due
                        to the committed for their exertions towards making the entertainment each
                        &amp; spleadid success. Thanks are also dae to Capt. Tucker, who, though not
                        on the committee, gave material help.</p>

                    <head>PLAGUE GERMS FROM SUEZ.</head>
                    <p>A very curious tale is told about the latest plot against the Tear, which was
                        evidently hatobed in Egypt. It is contained in a book entitled "Six Years at
                        the Rassian Court," which was only published this year. The | writer, Miss
                        Elgar, is an Irish lady in attendance on the children of the Imperial family
                        and the book was written with the consent of the Empresa. Ia &amp; chapter
                        devoted to attacks on the Tsar's life there is the following: "The last
                        attempt on the Emperor was most subtle. A parcel posted at Saez was sent,
                        marked Private'. He received it while seated at tea with the Emprese. On
                        being opened it was found to contain a piece of dirty cloth, apparently out
                        from an old pair of trousers. He exclaimed in wonder at receiving such a
                        curious thing. The Empress seized the tongs and, taking the dirty cloth in
                        them, sent it from the room. It was examined and found to be full of plague
                        germs." It would be interesting to know whether the Egyptian Government was
                        communicated with on the matter. Saez is- &amp; small place, and the person
                        who sent a packet to the Tsar from the Post Office there must have been
                        noticed at the moment. It must have been evidently somebody connected with
                        the medical profession who sent the parcel from Egypt.</p>

                    <p>Captain J. R. White, D S.O., 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders, has been
                        chosen for service with the Egyptian Army, and joins atCairo at an early
                        date. We need hardly say that Captain White is the son of Field Marshal Sir
                        George 8. White, V.C., the gallant Ulster veteran, who kept the flag flying
                        over hard-pressed. Ladysmith. Captain White entered his father's old
                        regiment, the "Gay Gordons," in January, 1899, and was promoted captain in
                        1904. He served in the Boath | African War, including the advance on Kim
                        berley, the actions of Magersfontein, Paardeberg, Poplar Grove, Driefontein,
                        Vet River, Zund River, the operations in the Transvaal. including the
                        engagements of Johannesburg and Pretoris ; the operations east and west of
                        Pretoria, the actions of Belfast and Lydenburg and the operations generally
                        in Cape Colony, Orange River Colony, and the Traps vaal, down to the close
                        of the war (mentioned in despatohés, D.3.0, Queen's medal with five olasps,

                    <head>BÉLL'S INDIAN AND COLONIAL LIBRARY.</head>
                    <p>One of the best series of publications, modelled on the Tauchnitz system,
                        "for circulation in India and the colonies only," is Messrs. George Bell and
                        Sons' Indian and Colonial Library. Among the latest additions to this
                        collection is &amp; most interesting account of the private life of the
                        Rogsian Imperial family, entitled "Six Yesrs at the R7ssian Court." The
                        writer is an Irish lady, who was an attendant on the children of the Tear.
                        There is so much falsehood written about the Emperor's family life that it
                        is pleasant to come across an obviously truthful account.</p>
                    <p>Another recent addition to the same library is the "Great Lord Burghley" by
                        Maria Home The period dealt with and the great statesman, who exercised a
                        more power for influence than any other Englishman, afford plenty of scopa
                        for historical reading of a most absorbing kind, and it would be difficult
                        to discover a more interesting historical work published this year.</p>
                    <p>All Mesars. Bell's publications are well printed and remarkably cheap in
                        price, and the works selected are well-chosen. We do not know of a better
                        "Colonial Library" than this excellent series.</p>

                    <p>(FROM AN OCCASIONAĻ CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Constantinople, April 26. </p>
                    <p>The political horizon has been more or less clouded over ever since the New
                        Year. Whence and why this atmospheric phenomenon is a matter for corjactore.
                        Possibly it is the result of the eruption of the political Vesuvius which
                        Europe has lately witnessed at Algeciras, but which, happily for Morocco,
                        has been beneficial in blowing off a dangerous quantity of political energy
                        that had been accumulating.</p>
                    <p>But whatever its origin, the lowering sky is far from pleasant, and there is
                        not a tey anxioge, as well as interested, watchers on the lookout for what
                        is looming ahead. The political atmospheric phenomena are rendered all the
                        more trying at present because Egypt is experiencing a new phase in her
                        political life. At home there is &amp; National movement for constitutional
                        rights, an agitation which we most condemo as premature. In her foreign
                        relations, Egypt. is being bustled on all sides. Turkey is intriguing in
                        Sinai ; Tripoli in Barbary is the theatre of the commercial rivalries and
                        political squabbles of the Powers, headed, 80 says "Le Temps," by Germany,
                        while, southwards, in Equatorial Africa, the Congo Free State has been
                        giving as no little trouble over another of those vexations frontier
                        misunderstandings.</p>
                    <p>The quarter, however, in which Egypt is mostly interested and wrongly so, a8
                        will be subsequently shown-is in Sinai. Egypt's quarrel with Turkey
                        regarding the title deeds to this peninsula world soon be over here it's
                        merely a question of the definite delimitation of all hitherto vaguely
                        charted desert.But, unhappiest it is not this aspect of an otherwise
                        insignificant frontier dispute which is worrying the British Government.
                        What they are anxious to find out is the motive which led the German Em.

                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The student of Oriental politics who has marked the growth of friendship
                        between Germany and Turkey of recent years will be curious to ascertain the
                        reason. That is German Majesty is a disciple of the Ottoman Despot, and has
                        essayed him. port the Sultan's system of centralisation into the Teton
                        Confederation, is &amp; fact patent to all. What is not so clear is, Why
                        should William II. take it upon himself to champion the cause, not only of
                        Turkey, bat of Islamism at large, and second the Sultan's claim to the
                        Spiritual Ralership of one third of the population of the world The reason
                        is not far to seek. It is attributable to the fact] that the Kaiser has been
                        compelled to be that Champion because he has committed himself to the
                        Sultan. It was seven years ago that he committed himself, and since then
                        there have been various peculiarities in his policy to! suggest this
                        position to the keen observer, bat they were pot and efficient. Time has
                        been pe008sary to sound this peculiar policy to the very. bottom. Some fipal
                        proof was needed and at last it has been found in the Akaba intrigue. which
                        has brought to light the truth of what previously was matter of conjecture.
                        This intrigue is dae, first to the Kaiser's Turcophile policy, and in the
                        next place it hugged after the lapse of seven years revealed the true object
                        of the Kaiser's visit to Constantinople in the autumn of 1898.</p>
                    <p>The object of that visit was officially described as betokening the
                        friendship of the Kaiser and the Soltan. Sach, indeed, it truly was. But the
                        language of diplomacy never betrayed its real meaning. The official
                        announcement was a partial truth to cloke the political character of that
                        automa errand.</p>
                    <p>What passed over the coffee oops in Merassim Kiosque has now been disclosed
                        by Akabe. In a tone and manner which most have required considerable
                        rehearsal, the Kaiser imparted to his Imperial host the sentiments of
                        apprehension that he felt regarding the threatening attitude of Egypt,
                        backed up by Great Britain, towards Mecca, and of her intentions of usurping
                        the right of the Turkish Caliph as Lord Paramount of the Hedjaz; and ed, in
                        tarn, of the Mohammedan world: Presumably, also, he explained the support of
                        Great Britain to Egypt's designs as being dictated by her interests in
                        India. It was, briefly, to frighten the Sultan that William II. went to
                        Stambool. In unfolding to his Otto man Majesty the scheme which he--and not
                        Izzat Pache-thought would counterAct Egypt's designs, the Kaiser took care
                        to Conceal the ulterior object he bad) in view, 'namely, of opening ap the
                        rich provinces of Asia Minor to German enterprise, The Sultan thought only
                        of his mənaoed prerogative as spiritual head of the Holy Mohammedan Empire ;
                        details such as working the Hedjaz Railway with 'German' engineers and
                        offering the Army in Syria with German instructors were Subordinate to the
                        general scheme and as each passed unnoticed. Properly frightened, Abdul
                        Hamid lent a willing ear to the councils of his German friend and readily
                        approved the plan of the Hedjaz Railway that had long previously been
                        prepared at Potsdam.</p>
                    <p>The Kaiser had won in so far as Tarkih policy was concerned, and since then
                        Germany has further strengthened her position in Asia Minor, but for these
                        concessions to German industry its champion had to do something for his
                        money, and the twofold task that now devolved upon him was to divert
                        Boropean attention from the strategic Hejaz Railway. until such time as it
                        was sufficiently near Mecca ; and, secondly, to satisfy the Sultan by some
                        move or other, like the present one at Akata, that his suspicions regarding
                        Egypt's <cb n="2"/> moditated aggression on the Hedjaz was justified.</p>
                    <p>All would have worked out as the Kaiser had schemed, and thanks to his
                        initiative and stratagem, German enterprise would have been S.S. red a firm
                        foothold in Asiatio Turkey, to the detriment of British commerce, had not
                        the political crisis in Turkey itself modified the Imperial plane to Boob an
                        extent that for some time Germany feared to lose ber predominant position;
                        in any case, she was forced I to reveal herself in hor trae colours to the |
                        Powers. The interference of the European Concert in Macedonia, and the Naval
                        demon. stration off Mitylene, was a bora trial to the Soltan, bat it was an
                        even greater one to the Kiser, who to justify himself alike in the eyag of
                        Europe and Turkey, had to adopt that fatiguing policy of "ronning will the
                        hare and hunting with the hounds." He succeeded as far as Turkey was
                        concerned, but only after securing for Germany her splendid isolation in
                        Boropean sentiment. At last an opportunity appeared itself to clear himself
                        in the eyes of Abdul Hamid of any complicity in the action of the Powers in
                        the Near East. The Hedjaz Railway had reached M.&amp;n, and in porgaance of
                        the sphere unfolded at Meraglim Kiosque seven years ago, troops were rented
                        down to. Akaba and then posted in the Sinsitio Peninsula. Thus this
                        Akaba/affair is the last card where the Kaisar has deluded the Sultan into

                        the bogey that the Kaiser for his country's interests has made of Egyptian
                        pretensions. Such a pretension we, may authoritatively declare to be foreign
                        to the intentions of the Govern. ment, which never has harboured such a
                        design. The Akaba intrigue is a sort of test by which the Kaiser hopes to
                        persuade the Sultan of the reality of his suspicions. ing Egyptian
                        aggression ; and the obstinacy of Turkey in maintaining her unwarranted
                        position in Sinai is due to the frantio efforts of the Kaiser to force the
                        Egyptian Government to take violent measures, and so justify his accusation.
                        We should recommend to Egypt to take no such steps, if such were her
                        intention, which we believe not to be.</p>

                    <p>**Such a configuration of political conditions in Southern Arabia would,
                        however, be decidedly inconvenient," the article proceeds, "to German

                        inflaenog they had acquired in Arabia to menace our economic position in
                        Asia Minor. The Baghdad Railway is a thorn in the flesh of the English as
                        they consider that it threatens their privileged position in the Persian
                        Gulf and they would probably welcome any opportunity for counteracting the
                        growing German interests in Asia Minor. Germany, therefore, cannot but hope

                    <p>The article concludes : "It is time that England recognised that Germany also

                    <head>OPENING FOR TRADE IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In his report to the Foreign Office on the trade and commerce of Alexandria
                        in 1905, Mr. Vice-Conceal Freeman says that it is highly satisfactory to
                        note that the shipping for the twelve months exceeded that for 1904 by 610
                        vessels and 383,290 tons. The principal contributor to the increase was the
                        United King. dom, with 181,440 tons, though it was closely followed by
                        Germany, with 140,935 tons. The imports for 1905 amounted to L.E.
                        19,066,338, against L.B. 18,125,496 in 1904, while exports amounted to
                        L.E.19,3 26,709, compared with L.E. 19,703,721 in 1904. "The principal
                        recommendation suggested to me," says Mr. Freeman, "with a view to the
                        increase of British, trade is again that manufacturers should study the.
                        market more closely. No amount of writing on the part of an agent will help
                        a firm in this study so much as the regular visits of a tra. veller, and, if
                        possible, an occasional personal visit by the head himself. But the
                        traveller ought not to be handicapped by having to adhere rigidly to fixed
                        patterns or designs, 84 much licence as possible should be given to him in
                        this respect. All quotations should be in the weights and currency of this
                        country and c.if Alexandria, not f.o.b, or free into trucks only. More, I
                        think, might be done by British firms in the way of advertising. Posters
                        should be printed in French and Arabic 88. well as Boglish." Among articles
                        for which there are openings, saddlery, watches, rubber tyros, stoves, and
                        glassware are mentioned.</p>

                    <head>SHIPPING TRADE IN THE LEVANT.</head>
                    <p>The directors of the German Ləvant Steamship Company in their report just
                        published state that the shipping trade in the Near East has been more
                        unfavourable during 1905 Than in the preceding year on account of the
                        troubles in Russia and the establishment of foar competitive services in the
                        Loyant trade. As to the question of rivalry, it is mentioned that a
                        Belgo-Egyptian firm came on the scene first, the Hamburg firm of Menzell and
                        Co. second, the newly-established Atlas Line of Bremen came third, and the
                        United Steamship Company of Copenhagen fourth. The result of the
                        competition, which has now been terminated by friendly agreement, was that
                        freights in the second half of 1905 fell to 58. per ton from Antwerp to
                        Alexandria and Syria. In these circumstances the financial results of the
                        Ger. man Lavant Line in 1905 were less favourable than in 1904, and the
                        profits of £30,781 have been almost entirely devoted to the depreciation of
                        the fleet. The surplus realised in 1904 was higher, but it was insufficient
                        to allow the payment of a dividend.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir,- I trust you will allow me space in yopi columns to ventilate a very
                            serious grievance. I am not one of those who write to the news. paper on
                            the slightest provocation, but I do believe that the Prayers can do
                            something when appeals to an autocratic body with a monopoly --Buch as
                            the Cairo Water Company--fail hopelessly.</p>
                        <p>I have been a resident in Cairo for several years, and it has been my
                            misfortune to have a flat-on the second floor of a building in the
                            Ismailia quarter. Bach sommer I hiva potjoed the same phenomenon, viz.,
                            that directly the Savoy Hótel closed, poop in the vicinity of it, on the
                            second floor, got no water during the day, although as long as the hotel
                            was open, they had a plentiful supply. I have tried hard to find a clue
                            to the mystery, but so far have tailed. There cannot be a serious fall
                            of the Nile within a few days of the Savoy closing as would account for
                            this lack of water. On the other hand, it would be generous to suppose
                            that the Hotel Company influenced such an upright company as that which
                            pretends to sopplý Cairo with water. A company which pays such large
                            dividends (at the expense of the public), and which gives auch entire
                            satis. faotion (during the tourist season) is surely above such
                            suspicion.</p>
                        <p>I have found that appeals to my landlord aid to the Water Company both
                            fail, and I therefore appeal to you, Sir, to help the poor waterless
                            ones in these days of khamseen. If ye do not do so at once, it will be
                            too late, as the director of the Water Works will be on his way home
                            (where water is plentiful), and Lord Cromer-ea well. We must strike the
                            iron while it is hot.</p>
                        <p>Joking apart, it is a crying scandal and disgrace to Cairo that nothing
                            is done to keep this precious Water Company in hand. I have carefully
                            studied the so-called agreements between the Government and the Water
                            Company, and endeavoured to find a single clause under which it was
                            possible to bring these people to book, with no result.</p>
                        <p>Very agreement-it is only too clear-has been drawn up in the office of
                            the Water Company, and the last agreement of all, to judge. by its
                            puerile simplicity-from the Govern: ment point of view - by the office
                            boy of that company. As the Government, therefore, sro tied hand and
                            foot in the matter, nothing remains to the public bat to keep on
                            agitating against such a company. It is not a matter for surprise, in
                            the circumstances, that there is so much typhoid fever in Cairo ; bat-it
                            really is amazing that in such a pseudo' up to date city this
                            intolerable state of things should be allowed to exist.</p>
                        <p>For obvious reasons, I do not think it necessary to sign this letter with
                            my proper name, bat should the Water Company attempt any kind of defence
                            of their misdeeds, I shall be only too happy to disclose my identity and
                            give chapter and verse for the accusation I have brought against this
                            shockingly inefficient corporation.—I am, etc </p>

                        terrains faites par la Société se montéraient à L.B. 400,000. Or, on
                        calculerait que si ces terrains étaient revendus anjurd'hai, ils

                    <head>THE TABAH AFFAIR.</head>
                    <p>COMMENTS OF HOME PRESS.</p>
                    <p>regarding orollary of was to be me</p>
                    <p>The home Press seems to have instantly accepted the announcement that the
                        British -garrison in Egypt was to be reinforced as a natural corollary of
                        the obduracy of Turkey regarding the Tabah incident. Commenting on this the
                        "Tribune" says :</p>
                    <p>"It is a sign that we accept the responsibility of protecting Egypt from
                        aggression and the action of Turkey has left us with no immediate
                        alternative. Not only has she seized territory which Egypt regards as hers,
                        and persisted in holding it in spite of protests, but she has taken an
                        equally high ling in her negotiations. She affects to regard the dispute as
                        a purely domestic concern between Turkey and a vassal State in which no
                        other Power has any concern. However difficult and undefined our own
                        position is in Egypt, we could hardly submit to being ignored in such a
                        question ; we are bound to insist on our rights as the protecting Power in
                        military occupation in Egypt. At the same time, while we could hardly refuse
                        to take up a challenge so directly, this practice of enforcing points in a
                        diplomatic argument: by a display of armed force is in general
                        objectionable, and needs to be watched very carefully to let it run away
                        with us. It logically implies that in the last resort we are prepared for
                        war ; and while &amp; direct refusal on the part of Turkey to recognise that
                        we have any position in Egypt ogold hardly have any other result, we should
                        make it quite clear that we should not dream of using force to settle a
                        simple question of fact - whether the Sinai Peninsula is Tarkish or Egyptian
                        territory. This distinction between the larger political question and the
                        smaller questions of fact should be kept constantly to the front. We must
                        assert, our right: 18 the Power in military occupation of Egypt; bat! if
                        Turkey withdrew from the occupation of the disputed points we should
                        doubtless be quite willing to refer questions of fact to an arbitral court
                        supposing there were no other way of obtaining &amp; settlement. We might
                        even supplement that policy by taking steps to get our position in Egypt
                        regularised, and to obtain a formal international mandate! in place of the
                        informal one that the absence of objection and the lapse of time may be held
                        to have given de."</p>
                    <p>The Daily News," writing on the subject, remarks that. " this rather
                        preposterous straggle" about the line of demarcation in the Sinai peninsula
                        has been characterised by the astal tricks of Saltanio diplomacy. We are
                        ever on the point of being satisfied, and never are satisfied. The Saltan
                        negotiates and sends delegates who disappear apparently into space. He
                        yields and returns to his position as though nothing bad happened. That has
                        ever been the way of the Sultan, who has never understood &amp; menace or a
                        threat which did not take the shape of a battleship. The claim of the Sultan
                        to Tabah and the ports along the Boothern section of the Peninsula is baged
                        6 upon a telegram sent by the Grand Vizier on the occasion of the scoassion
                        of the present Kbp Dive in 1892, declaring that Tabsh was an integral part
                        of the Empire, belonging to the district of Akatab. It seems an odd thing to
                        base a claim to a portion of the earth on a telegram. It smacks more of the
                        Kaiser than of the Sultan. Sironger grounds would certainly! have to be
                        showo, for the word of the Sultan, like that of a certain English king is
                        one that "no man relies on." It was reported at the end, of last month that
                        the redaction of the Tark'sh. force at Aqabah indicated that the Sultan was
                        giving way. But the fact remains that the Torks are still at Tabah, and we
                        venture to ' think they will be there as long as diplomacy is civil and not
                        military.'</p>

                    <head>"THE ARAB REVOLT."</head>
                    <p>In view of the present crisis arising out of the Akaba affair, a book on
                        Arabian politics will be welcome to all interested in them, especially as
                        regards the complicated and vaguely-determinate relations between Turkey and
                        Egypt. Sach a work has come to us from the pen of M. Bugen. Jang, formerly
                        French Vice-President in Indo-China, who has dedicated this book, "Les
                        Puissances devant la Révolte Arabe" (Hachette et Cie., 79. Boulevard Saint,
                        in Germain, Parir) to Negib-Azoury Boy, late Aljatant Governor of Jerusalem,
                        whom he describes as "the ardent patriot, the instigator of the Arab
                        National Movement, the fervent 'friend of France." Dealing exhaustively,
                        though in no wearisome manner, with every aspect of the Arab
                        problem-political, economica, international-his remarks are a revelation not
                        only of the Arab question, but of the more complicated one of the Near East.
                        A true sont of France, a reference to German politics is E pardonable, but
                        for all his opposition, M, Jung never descends from the level of
                        even-tempered, impartial criticism, a characteristic which will twin for his
                        book a well deserved popularity.</p>

                    <p>The following is part of an interesting article signed William Maxwell,"
                        which ap | Peared recently in the "Daily Mail":- </p>
                    <p>Cairo is no longer a feeble, imitation of Parir. It is tbe gay and débonnaire
                        city herself, with la touch of the East and &amp; snspicion of Wall street.
                        Ten years have wrought an amazing transformation.. Stray beyond the
                        Rsbekiyeb Gardens and yoda are in a new country. The street of a dilapidated
                        stable, where I bought horses for Omdorman is a boulevard of shops and banks
                        and palatial hotels, in which wealthy British, Americans, and Germane seek
                        refuge from winter. The old messman of the t| Highland Regiment is now a bey
                        and a financial magnate, and the modest hostelry where General Wauchope and
                        General Lyttelton drank success to our arms before the advance into the
                        debert has been swept into the background. Then-and Now.</p>
                    <p>How well I remember that night of nights the hot, moist air, the tables
                        spread on the balloony, the strong, esger fa08a-mapy, alas ! now ghostly
                        memories of the Sudan and South Africa--the cheers that rang out like a
                        battle ory, the toasts that were drunk and the glasses that were cast over
                        the shoulder when the last golden drop was drained. The shattering and
                        shivering of them still sounds in my ears like the olash of steel.</p>
                    <p>A blew race, as well as a new city has appeared. Those wore the days when
                        many in Cairo preferred the Khalifa to Lord Cromer, and prayed that the
                        blood of our Army would again crime on the sand of the desert. They do not
                        love us even now-these Egyptians. It is not in the nature of a Moslem to
                        show gratitude to a Christian governor. Yet in 1 their hearts they are
                        thankful for the liberty we have given them, for the freedom from
                        oppression, for the new wealth of the land and for the chance of living
                        their own lives. You feel it in the changed manner of the people.</p>

                    <p>Mr. C. H. Napping in the "Jewish Mission ary Intelligence" has an article
                        entitled 'Cairo revisited after many years," from which we extract the
                        following passage :</p>
                    <p>"In 1869, there was no regular English Church service. A room at the Grand
                        Hotel, which has since disappeared, was fi:ted up for that purpose when a
                        clergyman was available, and I had the privilege of ministering there to a
                        small congregation on the Sunday of my former visit. My dragoman asked me
                        the next day why the English worshipped God at the big grog obop! Now there
                        is a beautiful Baglish church, foll of interesting memorials of Gordon and
                        others who have won fame and died in Egypt, with regular services,

                        the evening service here better attended, and specially by young men, in
                        comparison with the morning, than is now really the case in well-to-do

                    <p>EFFORTS AFTER A MOSLEM EMPIRE</p>
                    <p>MYSTERIOUS PROPAGANDA IN THE CENTRAL SUDAN.</p>
                    <p>Advices just to hand from Northern Nigeria indicate renewed activity on the
                        part of the Sepoussists on the eastern frontier ol Borna, the most remote
                        province of the Protectorate bordering on Lake Tchad, and that there has
                        been trouble between them and the French and Germans in that region. The
                        Resident has reported the affair to Bir Frederick Logard at headquarters,
                        adding that some of Rabeh's horsemen have lately visited Bauchi.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the above, it may be stated that the mysterious influence of
                        the Senoussi and the spread of Benonssist propaganda in the Central Sudan is
                        a matter which always commands the anxious attention of the Protettorato
                        authorities, but so far, owing to the secrecy observed by Senoussist
                        emissaries, no direct evidence regarding the movement is obtainable. 1 The
                        native mallams always deny any knowledge of the matter when questioned. It
                        is, however, a well-known fact that the Mahom the medaus of the Central
                        Sadan hold the belief that the next great Golem empire will have its capital
                        at the holy hill of Bima, which is in the newly opened province of Bauchi,
                        to the north of the river Bende.-Reuter.</p>

                    <p>The best of the Senoussi first came into existence in 1843, bat dates its
                        real rise to power from the open encouragement it received from the Saltan,
                        Abdor Hamid, in 1882, who caused one thousand prayer books to be specially
                        printed for the sect, inscribed with the words, "Asking their help in
                        prayer." </p>

                        and words. He was said to be directly descended from the prophet's favourite
                        wife, and had one arm longer than the other, blue eyes, and the infallible
                        mark between the shoulders. By pine millions of Mahomedans in northern
                        Africa he was regarded as the trae Mahdi, and they only waited for his
                        signal to raise the banner of a holy war against the Christiang. </p>
                    <p>Proof of the Shelkh's Reputation.</p>
                    <p>His successor, the Sheikh-el-Senoussi, has inherited his influence, a
                        remarkable instance of which came out a few weeks ago. German diplomacy at
                        Constantinople induced the Sultan of Turkey to send a letter to the Sultan
                        of Morcoso suggesting that G-rmany was the true friend of the Moslem world.
                        The ruler of Morocco did not deign to reply to Abdul Hamid, whom he regards
                        as a very inferior personage, but wrote instead to the Sheikh elSenoussi on
                        the subject.</p>

                    <head>FRENCH EXPORTS TO EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>After the Anglo- French Convention con. cerning Egypt certain critics of M.
                        Delcaseé propheried that an immediate consequence of the sacrifice of the
                        position of France in that country would be a falling off of French trade.
                        The latest report of the French Consul at Cairo (the "Times" Paris
                        correspondent observer,) shows that these fea's were groundless.</p>
                    <p>The entente cordiale has removed all friction between the two countries. The
                        former tension having come to an end, the commercial interests of France
                        immediately profited thereby. As the "Mašin'' points on in its summary of
                        this Consular report on the commercial movement of Egypt, during 1905, for
                        the first time in many years, French trade in Egypt marks an increase,
                        whereas that of Germany has diminished. The increase in French imports is
                        dae to the larger demands for the produce of the Marseilles flour mills. Six
                        million, two hundred thousand franda (£248 009) more of these goods were
                        imported in 1905 than in 1904. French automobiles and, notably in Cairo,
                        electric cars are being imported in constantly increasing numbers. It is a
                        curious fact also that the majority of the provisions for the big Cairo
                        hotels come from Paris or Lyons. Unfortunately these products fizare in the
                        statistics, as German, since the exporters have to employ the German lines,

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
