                    <p>In the yearly report of the P. and 0. Company, published recently, it is
                        stated that the coming inauguration of a new mail service has rendered it
                        necessary to resume building operations, and tenders were recently invited
                        for the construction of mail and passenger steamers of the "M" class, but of
                        larger tonnage, and fitted with such improvements as experience has shown to

                        the two first named being built by Messrs. Caird and Co., and the third ship

                    <p>A contract has also been made with Messrs. Caird and Co. for an express mail

                        This vessel will be named the Salsette.</p>

                        been sent in. The con.. tract will run for seven years from Feb. 1st next,
                        the annual subsidy being £305,000, or £53,000 less than the present annual

                    <p>In the volume under the above title, which has just been published M. Maspero
                        reprints, with a few notes and emendations, the articles on Egyptian
                        antiquities that he has contributed to the "Journal des Débáts." of the
                        author it may be said without exaggeration that be touches nothing without
                        making it interesting, and there is nothing in these essays which will not
                        be read with the keenest pleasure by any one of an antiquarian turn of mind.
                        Especially there may be recommended to the general reader's notice the
                        article on the connexion of the Eleusinian Mysteries with Egypt; the many
                        tales, fantastic and otherwise, here summarized ; and the study on those
                        mummied animals which of all things in Egypt strike the modern tourist as
                        the most removed from his ideas. If we look for essays which will appeal
                        more to those who study Egyptology systematically, we shall find them in M.
                        Maspero's remarks on the works at Deir el-Bahari, the Sun-temples at Abusir
                        and elsewhere, and the controversy which has arisen over the supposed mummy
                        of Queen Tii, which he regards as really that of Khuenaten's son-in law and
                        successor, Se-aa-ka-ra "The Athenaeum" says, a pleasant feature in the book
                        is the impartial manner in which M. Maspero praises the work of other
                        Egyptologists, whether French, English, Swiss, or German, his avowed object
                        being to discourage no one, and therefore not to speak of any man's labours
                        unless he can say something in their favour. In this, as in other matters,
                        he has shown himself an ideal Director of the Service des Antiquités.</p>

                        in order to give admittance of the large vessels now coming regularly to
                        Alexandria. For example the dock is fifteen feet too small to admit the S.S.
                        "Heliopolis," which would under other circumstances dock here every two
                        months and with the S.S. "Cairo" and the third steamer, which it is proposed
                        to be built it would mean that the steamers of the Egyptian Mail Company
                        would use the dock eighteeen times a year. Each steamer has a crew of 350
                        men, who would spend during their stay in dock about £500 in the town every
                        time the vessel was docked. The SS. "Heliopolis" will now he obliged to use
                        the graving dock at Toulon or Gecoa, and will expend considerable sums in
                        docking the ship, annual overhauls, etc., in these ports instead of at

                        of still living members of Gladstone's Government of 1882. The only works in
                        his private letters published last July were an assertion that he did not
                        believe that Mr. Gladstone, Lord Gran. ville, and Mr. Morley
                        knowingly.conspired to have the Minister of a friendly state murdered in
                        cold blood by Turkish officials and that these ministers intrigued to get
                        murder done. In another letter he said "I do not believe that Morley wrote
                        or even saw the passages you cite" from the "Pall Mall Gazette" re Arabi's
                        murder. He had not discussed the Egyptian question with Mr. Morley since
                        they differed about it in 1882.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO OPERA SEASON.<lb/>SIGURD.</head>
                    <p>The most unsatisfactory aspect of "Sigurd" was, and is, the music. Long, arid
                        stretches of three time sentiment or indolent recitation, scarcely relieved
                        by flashes of pseudo-Wagnerişin, discourage singers and listeners alike.</p>
                    <p>The performance--if it is fair to criticise a performance in which the
                        participants have so little scope was good. The chorus was excellent : time,
                        accuracy and quality of voice were conspicuous, an amazing improvement on
                        former years. Of the principals M. Valette was quite the best: his
                        appearance was always a lucid interval amid the misty fainéantism of those
                        four long, long acts. Mr. Soubeyrau was correct and at moments emphatic and
                        excellent. Mlle Magne was also most adequate and consistent, as was the high
                        priest. Mlle Robertson has a charming voice and presence, but again one
                        cannot help remembering Mlle Devilloy in the part last year. We do not wish
                        to make comparisons between this and last, or any other year, but Mlle
                        Devilloy was one bright particular star, and cannot be forgotten, though
                        this need be no disparagement of her talented successor. At moments the
                        orchestra seemed to become bored and took refuge in profusion of sound,
                        especially when the brass was concerned, but as a whole it was well directed
                        and exact. Some of the audience seem to have established a pleasing and
                        facile basis of applause, governed one may say by the three dimension theory
                        - length, strength, and height. The moment M. Soubeyran rose above a certain
                        note, the clapping commenced: if he retained the note, it increased, if he
                        strengthened it, the manual labour became frantic. Perhaps this explains the
                        popularity of wrestlers and strong men in general in this country. Be it
                        noted, however, that a certain section of the abonnés discouraged this
                        rather promiscuous test of ability and did not applaud until the dimensions
                        of the singing approached the limit of the normal. As far as M. Valette was
                        concerned they were justified : his volume and resonance exactly fitted, or
                        rather enhanced, the some -what indigent music set before him. I retract
                        exactly fitted; it is not fair on M. Valette : he onn do ample justice , to
                        far better music. Incidentably we may all compliment Mr.Poucet on the
                        entre-actes : they are now of reasonable length, and give just time for one
                        cigarette and a few words of appreciation. It his company achieves as much
                        for performance as he has for organisation, we may well pardon last year,
                        and hope to enjoy, without prejudice or over-indulgence, our present season.
                        We may even contemplate a momentary exculpation of the high local
                        authorities who manage Mr. Poncet and Cairo opera in general.</p>

                    <p>"Concerning the Proposal of a Testimonial to LORD CROMER"</p>
                    <p>It is felt that it would be agreeable to members of the British Community to
                        subscribe to a farewell Testimonial to Lord Cromer who, during his nearly 24
                        years of residence in Egypt as H.B.M. Agent and Consul General, did so much

                    <p>It is proposed that the Testimonial should take the form of an annual Prize

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir, - If the account in yesterday's 'Egyptian Gazette" is a true version of
                        the procedure of a Native Court we must condemn it as a mere parody of
                        justice, The, speech of the Chief of the Parquet, it a correct translation
                        from the Arabic, appears on the face of things a mere tissue of
                        misstatements from beginning to end, and facts known to the authorities have
                        been twisted to serve some sinister purpose of the Egyptian party in
                        politics. The verdicts have been based merely on circumstantial evidence, a
                        method which is not accepted by the police authorities. The report, I hope
                        is faulty, the result 1, of an imperfect knowledge of the Arabie, language,
                        and I should be glad to procure a translation of the 'conte rendu' by some
                        good Arabic scholar giving the cross-examination of witnesses. The report as
                        it stands is an instructive revelation as to the fitness of the Egyptiang to
                        judge his own compatriote. But this, I believe, is the 'nen policy, and may
                        serve.as a good object lesson to the natives of this country of the capacity
                        of their own lawyers and judges. To give only one or two examples. The Chief
                        of the Parquet showed how Safwat tried by all means to get a bribe of L.E.
                        40 from one Ismail Hassan of Rosetta and also L.E. 5 from Mahmoud Neguib -
                        bribes for placing people in Government posts—and we find him acquitted !
                        Again, the Chief of the Parquetgives an absolutely incorrect account of the
                        first finding out of bribery and corruption in the Ports and Lights
                        Administration, trying to give all the credit to the Finance Ministry,
                        instigated no doubt, by some sinister means, to support the "Enquiries" and
                        Conseil de Discipline which were dominated by a native official who was
                        favoured by the Minister of Finance. There must be some truth in the remark
                        which is being banded about on all sides "that the British authorities are
                        giving the natives the proverbial long rope to hang themselves".</p>

                    <p>Following on the opening of the casino and gardens on Saturday last, the new
                        Club, known as the "Helouan International Club," has been opened under, most

                        visitors from Cairo, who enjoyed one of Egypt's sunniest and balmiest of
                        days in the very pleasantest of spots, rendered gay by the strains of the
                        excellent band of the King's Royal Rifles. The magnificent marquee attracted
                        many tea parties, and the scene was as brilliant as any yet chronicled from
                        Helouan. The gardens this year have been laid out with so much taste, that
                        the former stigma of aridness attached to the name of Helouan is at once
                        completely refuted and forgotten, and the several attractions offered to the
                        public for the small charge of P.T. 2, ensures the success of the very
                        excellent scheme and arrangement due to the initiative of the Egyptian Delta

                        doubt but that the move is immediately and thoroughly appreciated by the
                        largest and most influential of the resident population.</p>
                    <p>The club is purely a social one, and offers A rendezvous that Helouan has
                        greatly wished for, and from the remarks made in an address at the opening
                        ceremony by, a prominent Egyptian resident, the aim of the club would be to
                        cement the friendship of all races living in Egypt, to promote, concord, and
                        disperse all misunderstandings. These sentiments were cordially endorsed by
                        all present, and the first meeting of the committee and members ended in a
                        prevailing feeling that a firmer friendship was about to be established.</p>
                    <p>The club is to be run during the winter season, and to afford all the
                        comforts and attractions that modern day institutions of that kind are able
                        to offer, such as writing, reading, card, and billiard rooms, etc, and three
                        billiard tables to a club newly formed is indicative of what one may expect
                        for the rest in the matter of provision for the needs of its members. We
                        wish the Helonan International Club a hearty send off and a successful
                        career, and were it possible to make Helonan slightly more accessible than
                        it is at present, such as a direct communication, by road with Cairo, we
                        have no doubt but that many Cairenes would be found enrolled amongst its
                        members.</p>

                    <head>EDUCATION OF MOHAMEDANS.<lb/>GATHERING AT PORT SAID.</head>
                    <p>A large gathering, of high functionaries and notables of Port Said was held
                        at the Eastern Exchange Hotel last week to wish success to Osman Eff.
                        Raafat, who is returning to Bingapore, and takes with him four fellow
                        countrymen to carry on the working of a Mohammedan school he has established
                        there. The assembly was held under the presidency of Hassan Eff. Bakhry,
                        Mamour of Cherif Basin Customs, who had organized a very able committee to
                        arrange the proceed. ings, with a reception and tea, followed by a dinner at
                        9 o'clock at which the Governor of the Suez Canal, Moheb Pasha, the
                        SubGovernor, Riad Bey, and the Judge of the Native Court, Izzet Bey, were
                        among those present.</p>
                    <p>The Sheikh el Ulema was called upon to open the after dinner oratory. Moheb
                        Pasha in his speech alluded to the happy idea of the President in
                        celebrating this unique occasion in such a befitting manner, and urged the
                        mission to be diligent and courageous.</p>
                    <p>Other speeches followed in which were set forth the excellent, and for this
                        country the almost unprecedented, example set by Osman Eff. Raafat in
                        leaving Egypt to take up his. home in a far country like Singapore, and to
                        establish a school there for the benefit of his 00-religionists, also
                        referring to the fact that he had returned only to secure further help by
                        selecting Egyptian teachers. A hope was also expressed that he would again
                        return to secure higher grade teachers as the needs of the work
                        demanded.</p>
                    <p>It was also pointed out that the Egyptians are about the only nation who have
                        no love for emigration which has hitherto been a bár to their progress, and
                        on this account the efforts of this gallant band of teachers deserve the
                        highest commendation.</p>

                        Sudan Government which took place suddenly in Edinburgh last week. Bir
                        George MaophersonGrant, was. from 1879 to 1886. member of Parliament for the
                        Counties of Elgin and Nairn.. He took a prominent part in county Affairs,
                        and was a well-known breeder of Angus cattle. Sir George was born in 1839,
                        and succeeded to to the baronetey on the death of his father in 1850. His
                        son John, who was born in 1868, succeeds to the title and estates.</p>
                    <p>The death of Sir George Macpherson Grant will place a number of people in
                        mourning in Scotland, where he was quite a great personage. He was always
                        one of the most energetic members of the committee of the Northern Meeting
                        at Inverness in his younger days, and his son, the new Baronet, is equally
                        well-known and popular there. The new Lady Macpherson Grant was Miss Mary
                        Dennistoun, daughter of the late Mr Alexander Dennistoun, of Gold: hill, and
                        Mrs. Dennistoun, who lives very quietly at her own place, Row, in

                        and the Cotton Crop". This lecture will embody all he learned, on his
                        journey to the equator and gives an account of the cotton he saw from
                        Alexandria to the equator and a description of the White Nile as Sir William
                        saw it. He will then show how valuable three sites are for reservoirs, and
                        estimates how readily Egypt and the Sudan, could be irrigated all over for
                        £1,500,000. He will give a criticism of the Assouan dam as being raised and
                        of the Cairo water supply as bearing on the question of green water and
                        reservoirs.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN TRADE CRISIS.</head>
                    <head>AFFAIRS OF MR. NICOLAS DOKI.</head>
                    <p>In the Manchester County Court on Wednesday week application was made to his
                        Honour Judge Parry to approve of a scheme of composition proposed by Mr.
                        Nicolas Doki, of this city and Beyrout, against whom a receiving order was
                        made on October 4. Mr. Edgar, solicitor, appeared in support of the
                        application.</p>
                    <p>The Official Receiver (Mr. J. Grant Gibson) presented a long report. It
                        showed that the composition was approved by the required majority of
                        creditors on November 21. Under it the debtor proposed to pay his debts in
                        full, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, in the following
                        manner:- 2s. 6d. in the pound at the end of one month from the date of the
                        Court's approval, 58. in the pound six months afterwards, 5s in the pound
                        twelve months afterwards, and 78. 6d. in the pound eighteen months
                        afterwards. Mr. John Philip Garnett, chartered accountant, of Boothstreet,
                        Manchester, was to be trustee. Of the fourteen creditor's for £11,461
                        admitted to vote, twelve creditors for £10,445 accepted the scheme.</p>
                    <p>The debtor's statement of affairs showed unsecured liabilities of £101, and
                        liabilities on accommodation bills as acceptor or endorser £25,478, of which
                        it was 'expected £17,750 would rank for dividend ; while the assets were
                        estimated to produce £28,271. The debtor was engaged from 1888 to 1905 with
                        various shipping firms doing business with Beyrout and the East and with
                        South Africa and South America. They were successful, and in January, 1905,
                        he found himself possessed of £8,000 capital, consisting mainly of
                        book-debts assigned to him as his share of the assets of his old firm of
                        Doki, Chiha, and Co., which was then dissolved. With this and £2,000
                        advanced by Messrs. R. Pharaon et Fils, of Beyrout, he began business on
                        January 1, 1905, as a shipper and general merchant, under the style of N.
                        Doki and Co., in Oxford-street, Manchester, and at Beyrout. The present
                        position of the firm of N. Doki and Co. was that, apart from a certain
                        liability on bills, it possessed assets of a value exceeding its liabilities
                        by rather more than £10,000the estimated surplus assets of the Beyrout house
                        over its liabilities, which were of small amount. The debtor bad from time
                        to time discounted other than' purely trade bills, but no liability was
                        likely to arise from this except in connection with his acceptances for
                        Messrs. Pharaon, Cousins, and Co., of Cairo, for whose accommodation he had
                        accepted bills amounting to £17,250. Messrs. Pharaon had filed in the
                        Egyptian courts, the equivalent of a bankruptcy petition, and had submitted
                        a scheme, which had been approved, for the pay. ment of twenty shillings the
                        pound.</p>
                    <p>An essential feature of the scheme, the Official Receiver went on to say, was
                        that all but 68. in the composition would be paid by Messrs. Pharaon, and
                        that they would eventually refund to the debtor the 68. also. It was obvious
                        that the complete fulfilment of the scheme depended on the solvency of
                        Messrs. Pharaon, Cousins, and Co. The books of that firm had been examined
                        by accountants, and showed assets to a snbstantial amount. At the same time
                        the Official Receiver felt that the Court would be reluctant to sanction a
                        proposal obviously of a precarious nature, and unlikely to result in real
                        benefit to the creditors. The total provable liabilities at the date of the
                        report were £16,785, whilst the debtor's own assets were likely to produce
                        £10,000. The only matter in the debtor's own trading and conduct which
                        "prima facie" might appear open to criticism was accepting bills to such a
                        large extent for Messrs. Pharaon's accommodation ; but as the debtor had
                        with perfect safety and benefit done financial business with them for twenty
                        years, he could not be charged with rash and hazardous speculation. The
                        Official Receiver understood that Messrs. Pharaon were at present perfectly
                        solvent, but were temporarily in financial difficulty owing to the locking
                        up of a lot of their capital in land, which, if thrown indiscriminately on
                        the market, would produce disastrous effects not only to themselves but to
                        other Egyptian firms.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Edgar, in submitting that the proposal was a reasonable one, pointed out
                        that the whole of the assets were in Beyrout. He him. seif and Mr. Garnett,
                        acting for the whole body of bankers concerned in the Egyptian failures, had
                        had an investigation made, and he could assure the Court that the Official
                        Receiver's report on the position of Messrs. Pharaon was very conservative.
                        Moreover, he was now in a position to add that further assurance was to be
                        found in the fact that the whole of the landed property of Messrs. Pharaon
                        was included in a mortgage in the hands of the debtor's representatives in
                        Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Judge Parry: That, of course, makes this scheme very much better.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Edgar said it was a matter which had come to hand since the Official
                        Receiver drew, up his report. It would be within the recollection of the
                        Court that a large number of Egyptian houses went down at the end of July,
                        at the same time as Mr. Doki, in consequence of exceptional pressure there,
                        and he was glad to say that not a single one of them up to the present had
                        made any suggestion to its creditors of less than twenty shillings in the
                        pound. To that the creditors were bound, he thought, not only in this
                        instance but in all others of these failures to get twenty shillings in the
                        pound.</p>
                    <p>His Honour Is the creditor here who did not assent?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Edgar: He is not. It is a foreign bank. The only objections we have had
                        to these schemes, except where they have been carried privately, have come
                        from Kankers abroad who have thought they could manage to get pay-<cb n="2"
                        />ment in advance.</p>
                    <p>His Honour said he need not hear anything else. He was glad to find the
                        scheme was even better than set out by the Official Receiver, and he hoped
                        it would be carried out. In any case he did not intend to stand between
                        creditors and twenty shillings in the pound. He found the schému reasonable
                        and calculated to benefit the creditors, and he accordingly approved of
                        it.</p>

                        5/16, hausse dont nous n'avions pu obtenir l'explication. La voici : elle
                        témoignera da sérieux de certaines de nos agences. Alors que cette valeur
                        était couramment offerte à 3 1/8, un courtier aurait soi-disant vendu en
                        clôture 25 titres à 3 5/16 et aurait exigé la cotation à ce prix, malgré les
                        protestations unanimes des vendears à 3 1/8. Aujourd'hui, naturellement,
                        l'équilibre s'est rétabli de lui-même et le courtier en question n'ayant pas
                        jugé à propos ! d'en vendre encore 25 à 3 5/16, le prix réel de 3 1/8 a été
                        rétabli.</p>
                    <p>Sur le reste de la cote il n'y a pas de variations appréciables à signaler.
                        En somme, la semaine clôture comme elle avait commencé, c'est-à-dire dans
                        l'inaction la plus complète. S'il y a une tendance, elle est pour la
                        lourdeur, les vendeurs étant les plus nombreux.</p>

                        command of the 8th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, or Carlow Militia. It
                        is a smart little eorps of four companies.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant G. H. Barnett, 4th. Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, has been
                        promoted captain, Captain Barnett served a little over eight years for his
                        company, and was employed with the Mounted Infantry in the Transvaal and
                        Orange River operations, in the course of which he has severely wounded
                        (Queen's medal with five clasps).</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Heywood, Coldstream Guards ; Lieutenant Davenport, Lancashire
                        Fusiliers; Lieutenant Wheatley, Dorsetshire. Regiment, and Captains Daubney
                        and Ryan, Essex Regiment, have been seconded in their respective regiments
                        for service with the Khedive's army.</p>
                    <p>Cavalrymen in Egypt will be interested to know that the new sword-designed
                        specially for thrusting—is now being used in the regiments of the First
                        Cavalry Brigade, Aldershot, for the purpose of being reported upon. Like
                        many another thing, it is the outcome of experience in the South African
                        War, in the course of which the regulation sword was found next to useless,
                        being designed rather for slashing than pointing. The natural inclination of
                        the muscular Anglo Saxon is to hew down his enemy by the downright dint of
                        physical force, whereas the Latin races are inclined to give the more deadly
                        point. The new weapon is a little bit longer, and lighter than the
                        regulation sword. It is edgeless till the last seven inches of the point,
                        where it is sharpened keenly into a tapered point of deadly thrusting
                        powers. The blade is of the best steel, and to give it rigidity the back is
                        thickened. The hilt balances the weapon nicely and gives complete protection
                        to the hand.</p>
                    <p>Those who know the history of South Africa advise caution with regard to the
                        alarming rumours from that quarter. They do not deny the possibility of a
                        rising among the Zulu tribes, but they call to mind the fact that there are
                        plenty of not too scrupulous people in the Southern portion of the African
                        Continent whose interest it is to exaggerate any bad news that might be
                        forthcoming. It used to be said that Cape Colony never flourished save when
                        there was a war on hand, and Great Britain was pouring men and stores into
                        the -country, and Cape Colony is not particularly flourishing just now.</p>
                    <p>With a view to the absorption of supernumerary non-commissioned officers of
                        reduced regiments created by the disbandment of their - 3rd and 4th
                        Batalions, the Army Council has under consideration a suggestion that these
                        non-commissioned officers shall be transferred, if they consent, to other
                        regiments, carrying with them the date of seniority in their rank Before
                        coming to a decision in the matter, the Army Council has called for
                        information as to what number of supernumerary non commissioned officers of
                        the regiments in question are desirious of being so transferred.</p>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion Yorkshire Regiment, on arrival next month, will be
                        stationed in Alexandria it is understood.</p>
                    <p>The militia of the United Kingdom will train under the old conditions in the
                        coming year. In fact, it is believed that the whole scheme of militia reform
                        is about to be shelved indefinitely, for want of funds.</p>
                    <p>The first of the battleships to return home from the Mediterranean under the
                        new conditions is the "Formidable," Captain Herbert Lyon, and which will be
                        replaced by the battleship "Goliath," Captain F.S. Miller.</p>
                    <p>The battle squadron of the Atlantic Fleet is reported to have done well at
                        the recent practice off Gibraltar, the scores being-"Al bemarie," 36 bits;
                        "Cornwallis" 33 hits ; "Exinouth," 32 hits ; "Albion," 31, all with the 12

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Sir, - It has often been remarked by the careful observer that when there
                            is any disturbance in a seething mass of anything, strange matters come
                            to the surface. Although Egypt is not such an interesting place to live
                            in as it was thirty years ago, it is still a land of broad contrasts,
                            and these are often more apparent to the stranger than to those to whom
                            habit has made things familiar. A few days since I happened to go from
                            here to Cairo in the same carriage with an intelligent lady who had just
                            landed in Egypt for the first time. Referring to the noisy landing she
                            said : "The natives seem very violent, are they dangerous?" I was
                            pleased to reassure her on this point. This lady was surprised at the
                            European appearance of Alexandria, but much more so when we passed the
                            first Arab village and pointing to the mud huts, asked what those things
                            were ? I replied that those were the houses the people lived in who made
                            the wealth of this country, of which we European residents helped them
                            to spend a part. The lady said she had no idea that in this 20th
                            century, there was any part of the world in which human beings lived in
                            such a way.</p>
                        <p>As our train took just three hours longer, than it should have done, to
                            reach Cairo, this lady had ample time for observation, and I fancy that
                            but for the language we were speaking, and the courtesy due to a
                            stranger, from whom some further information might possibly be acquired,
                            she would have liked to say something far from complimentary, as to the
                            effect on the natives of the influence of both foreign residents and a
                            foreign occupation.</p>
                        <p>Later on when I saw this lady in the luxurious halls of Shepheard's
                            hotel, and expressed the hope that the unpleasant impressions of the
                            morning had been removed, she said, - "this is indeed a country of
                            strange contrasts," but I do not think that she had forgotten, the mud
                            huts, or the lack of clothes exhibited by some of their inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>Although Egypt is only a very small part of the world, it has for some
                            years past, attracted a very large amount of attention; its great
                            antiquity, its assimilation of the most modern appliances, its sudden
                            evolution from bankruptcy to a flourishing financial position, the
                            change in the status of its people from something closely approaching
                            slavery to an almost exuberant liberty, the remarkable development of
                            its commerce, the host of new companies, the wild speculation, the
                            inevitable crisis, all these things have attracted the attention of the
                            civilised world in a degree altogether out of proportion to the size of
                            the country.</p>
                        <p>For some years past up to the spring of this year, everything seemed to
                            go on wheels; —then came the crisis, and it began to be found out that
                            many of the new companies started, had no cause for existence, and that
                            their shares though rup up by wild speculation to several times their
                            par value, were only a drug on the market. Very many of these companies
                            were formed under the English law of limited liability. This law is
                            based on many Acts of Parliament from 1862 to 1907, all of them more or
                            less obscure, and this same obscurity has for many years been largely
                            taken advantage of, to do many things which ought not to have been done,
                            and to neglect obligations which should have been complied with.</p>
                        <p>But if the former Acts of Parliament left a pleasing doubt on the mind as
                            to liability for neglect of duty, and such doubts have been, once and
                            for ever, very clearly removed by a new Act dated August in this year of
                            Grace 1907. There is no doubt about this Act ;-it puts on companies and
                            more particularly on their directors penalties hitherto unheard of;
                            enough to make one's hair stand on end, so steep is the way, and 80
                            Darrow is the only path, by which they may be avoided. The number of
                            people in Egypt who are directors of limited liability companies, must
                            be legion, but to any honest man who has not already got his head in the
                            noose, and who may have some foolish wish to see his name figure on a
                            list of Directors, my advice is that which was given by "Punch" to the
                            man hesitating about getting married ;-—-"don't".</p>
                        <p>As soon as I heard of the new Act I sent for a copy, but when it came it
                            was useless It refers to every imaginable act passed before. I was in an
                            out of the way place, where the old Acts were not to be found, and it
                            was only when I got home, surrounded by a pretty ample legal library
                            that I was able to find out where my responsibilities ended.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to see in your paper of yesterday that your correspondent "Lex"
                            has taken up the question, but in the first place I do not quite agree
                            with what he seems to infer, and secondly I think his proposal though
                            right in principle is too drastic in form. He seems to infer that men of
                            other than British nationality can infringe the law with impunity. I
                            would recommend these gentlemen to lay no such flattering unction to
                            their souls ; the British law has a long arm, and if necessary it has an
                            uncomfortable way of getting outside assistance, and in my opinion it
                            would be better for all directors of British limited liability companies
                            of whatever nationality they may be to put their house in order without
                            much loss of time.</p>
                        <p>I cannot believe that our Parliament would intentionally have passed an
                            act from which it might result that a British subject sitting on the
                            Board of an English Company, should find himself at a disadvantage with
                            his foreign colleagues. If such should prove to be the case the sooner
                            it is remedied the better, and I appeal to you Sir, through the medium
                            of your columns, to submit this important matter <cb n="4"/>

                        <p>Before a very large gathering of spectators the final of the tournament
                            was played off on Wednesday between the King's Own Scottish Borderers
                            and the 60th Rifles. The excellent form shewn by the 60th was a surprise
                            to most. That they were a vastly improved team we all knew, but the jump
                            they have made in the last week is a big one. Their hitting was very
                            good, and they were quicker on to the ball than their opponents. Each
                            member of the team did his share of the work and it is hard to pick out
                            any one as having excelled over the others. Mr. Evans is a lusty No I.,
                            and rides his mare well. Mr. Seymour and Capt. H. B. Kennedy hit
                            straight and well, and Mr. Hope at back was seldom caught napping. At
                            the same time we have never seen the K.O.S.B. so off their game ; their
                            hitting was weak and their ponies seemed slow at starting. Capt.
                            Kennedy, who can be so brilliant at times, was especially
                            disappointing.</p>

                        <p>From the throw in the 60th gave an example of what was to follow. They
                            got away with the ball and scored in the first half minute ; and shortly
                            afterwards added 2 more goals to which the K.O.S B. retaliated with a
                            solitary goal. The 60th then seemed to be always attacking and the score
                            mounted up. The K.O.S.B. were very unfortunate in their shots at goal,
                            several attempts only just missing. The last chukker Capt. Stoney scored
                            again for the K.O. S.B. with a very neat back hander. Final scores 60th
                            Rifles 8 goals ; K.O.S.B. 2 goals. The 60th have our hearty
                            congratulations on their victory.</p>
