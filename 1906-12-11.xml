                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S FIRE BRIGADE.</head>
                    <p>In yesterday's issue we published a report on the excellent organisation of
                        which Miralai Hopkinson Bey and Superintendent Waller are the heads—the
                        Alexandria Fire Brigade. The mention of that name always brings to the mind
                        the memory of Captain Lynn, whose hooter used to so startle the inhabitants'
                        of the main streets at times. Captain Lynn has gone, but he has left the
                        mantle to a successor no less enthusiastic, and the result of whose efforts
                        was amply manifest on Saturday afternoon. The organisation of the brigade is
                        distributed into six stations, Moharrem Bey, Minet-el-Bassal, Menshieh,
                        Ramleh, Ras-el-Tin, and Ibrahimieh, and the total force musters 120 men.
                        Moharrem Bey, where an exhibition of the fire extinguisher's art took place
                        on Saturday, is the headquarters, and an old station, but for all that none
                        the lens energetic. For recently it underwent a series of reforms, in the
                        way of repairing sheds and out-buildings. It is not an imposing erection,
                        and would hut ill compare with Captain Blake's trim building at Cairo ; hut
                        "comparisons are odious. It is the intelligent organisation within which is
                        the outer adornment of Moharrem Bey. Not so many years ago, a goat's walk
                        skirted the foot of Kom el Dik from the station to Rosetta road, but this
                        has been transformed into a carriageable road along which the brigade's fire
                        engines can proceed should their services be required in that quarter. The
                        reforms alluded to are under the supervision of an expert who lately came
                        out from England. So that we can look for much in the not distant
                        future.</p>
                    <p>Coming now to the results of Saturday's show, as our reporter justly
                        observed, me-chanical perfection, is all very well, but it is after all the
                        human machine that tells in the end, and the Municipality, the insurance
                        agent, and the timid citizen may well congratulate and comfort themselves on
                        having such stalwarts to protect their lives and property. Happily,
                        Alexandria, excepting a cotton shoonah blare occasionally, is free from
                        disastrous fires ; hence the prosperity of the insurance companies ; and so
                        the services of Captain Waller and his men are not often required. While
                        this is not to be regretted, there is this plea for their existence and high
                        efficiency, and it is a plea based on the broad grounds of—to borrow a
                        Tautonism— Welt politik. In the fire brigades, as in every other service, we
                        have introduced rules of discipline and organisation that did not exist
                        before. Previously tatterdemalion volunteers and other barbarous sansulottes
                        flew with their hand pumps to the scene of fire,—to steal what they would
                        not extort as the price of their undesirable services. British Occupation,
                        however, changed all this, and order prevails where it did not before. To
                        the native mind, therefore, this high standard of efficiency, in the
                        defensive or civil services, and in our own local case, that of Alexandria's
                        "Askari touroumba," stands as the symbol and measure of what we are
                        worth.</p>

                        <p>A curious incident happened on the Orient liner Ortons which recently
                            left Suez ont-ward bound. A desire to see the Colonies and an ambition
                            to make her way in the world induced a London girl, not much over
                            fifteen years of age, to run away from home and go to Tilbury. There she
                            boarded the steamer Ortons, and. mixing with the third class passengers,
                            evaded notice. But after the vessel left Ply-month she was discovered,
                            and at Marseilles she was transferred to the homeward-bound Orient. She
                            was reluctant to return, and only recovered her spirits when, at Tilbury
                            she saw her mother.</p>

                        Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at Washington on the question of the
                        powers which, he possesses as the representative of the United States of
                        North America to expel an American citizen from Egypt in reference to the
                        scandals created by a newspaper in Cairo owned and edited by Captain Jorge
                        Nelkin y Waldberg.</p>
                    <p>The authorities at Washington have informed the American Diplomatic Agent
                        that it is impossible to expel any American citizen from Egypt, and no
                        action can be taken against any such person, who persists in making false
                        and malignant charges against the officials of another Power, unless the
                        aggrieved party or parties lodge a sworn complaint with the American
                        representative, who would then be bound to take legal measures.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances it would appear that Mr. Iddings has done his
                        utmost in the matter,and that it now rests with the aggrieved parties to

                    <p>We regret to bear that Mrs. Arthur Kelham had a nasty fall from her horse
                        yesterday afternoon during the Royal Dublin Fusiliers' paper chase. While
                        galloping over the desert near Sidi Bichr her horse unexpectedly encountered
                        a line of barbel wire in mid-desert Mr. Kelham was thrown headlong over the
                        horns and the latter was severely cut about the breast. </p>
                    <p>The rise in properly has induced a large number of people to speculate in
                        desert sites in the neighborhood of Alexandria, and one of the unpleasant,

                        expanse of sand, is that now in the midst of a gallop one is very likely to
                        be thrown and one's steed seriously injured by coming into unexpected
                        contact, with these signs of private ownership. The custom of putting up
                        barbed wire is especially dangerous to the police and coast guard mounted

                        have had most shocking injuries. There were a number of other riders
                        following her and they were only just in the nick of time to pull up when

                        greatly improved, both as regards buildings and ground", which improvements
                        have vastly increased its value. The Tewfik Palace was formerly the
                        favourite residence of the late Khedive Tewfik, and it is there that his
                        Highness died.</p>
                    <p>The situation of the hotel is one of the finest in Helonan, being isolated
                        from all buildings and on the edge of the desert. The race-course adjoins
                        the property, and Dr. Bentley, who is himself a keen sportsman, spent a
                        large sum in making the course and erecting a stand, and the purchasers of
                        the property are to be congratulated on having acquired what will no doubt
                        prove a valuable investment.</p>

                    <head>BOARD AND THE GOVERNMENT.</head>
                    <p>A board meeting of the National Bank was held yesterday to discuss the
                        proposals of the Government, which had for their object the conversation of
                        the National Bank into a State Bank, as far as is compatible with the
                        cordi-tions of the country. The proposals of the Government were discussed
                        in detail and criticised by the special committee appointed for that
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>We understand that while differences of opinion exist on certain points in
                        these proposals, which are more or less matters of detail, there is no
                        reason to believe that the negotiations will fail to be concluded in a
                        manner satisfactory to both parties. At the same time it would be unwise to
                        anticipate their immediate con-clusion, in as much as they deal with complex
                        financial and administrative questions which cannot be resolved by a day's
                        discussion.</p>

                    <head>IMPORTANT PAPYRUS FIND.<lb/>THE PLAYS OF MENANDER.</head>
                    <p>A highly interesting discovery has just been made in this country. M.
                        Lefebvre, one of the inspectors in the service of the Department of
                        Antiquities, has been fortunate enough to disinter a large number of leaves
                        of a papyrus codex of Menander, containing upwards of 1,200 lines. The
                        leaves are not continuous, but be has found as much as 500 lines from each
                        of two plays, two more being represented by smaller quantities The
                        publication of this most welcome discovery is promised for next year, and
                        should enable modern scholars for the first time to form an independent
                        judgment on the style and genins of the famous comic dramatist.</p>
                    <p>Menander was the most popular dramatist of the Graeco Roman world, and his
                        comedies of manners were the models that Plautus and Terence freely copied,
                        and through them influenced the modern drama in its early days. Yet the
                        works of this much praised Greek have hitherto been known to modern scholars
                        only in short fragments, and his fame has had to be taken on trust. The new
                        discovery, it seems, includes long portions of two plays, making about five
                        hundred lines of each. It should now be possible, therefore, to form an
                        accurate opinion of the literary merits of the "New Comedy," almost as well
                        as the older Aristo-phanic comedy, of which, by some curious trick of fate,
                        so many examples have been preserved. This happy find is a new illustration
                        of the value of spade-work io archaeology. The sands of Egypt, and perhaps
                        also the buried libraries of Heronlaneam, doubtless hold many more literary

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON EXPORTS TO GREAT BRITAIN.</head>
                    <p>The figures of exports of Egyptian cotton from the commencement of the season
                        to November 28 show that the shipments from Alexandria for Great Britain's
                        use have been 146,472 bales, which is 24,301 more than last year's at this
                        time Out of these Liverpool re-ceives83.750 bales and Manchester 62,722
                        bales, which, compared with last year at this time, shows an increase of
                        9,847 bales to Liverpool and 14,454 bales to Manchester. The shipments to
                        the United States are 13,414, against 19,752 bales, and to the Continent,
                        India, and Japan altogether 90,785 bales, or an increase of 7,465 bales. The
                        total exports to all parts are 250,571 bales, which compares with 225,243
                        bales at the corresponding time last season.</p>
                    <p>Commenting upon the growth of the port of Manchester, at the annual meeting
                        of the Manchester Cotton Association, Ltd., last week, the president stated
                        that the imports of Egyptian cotton to Manchester during the year ended
                        August 31 constituted a record, having amounted to 212,257 bales against
                        183,297 in the previous season. That this is some 44 per cent. of the total
                        imports of Egyptian cotton to Great Britain should, he said, be a matter of
                        considerable satisfaction to all. The balance of the importations amounted
                        to 3,383 bales, and were composed of East Indian and African cotton. Since
                        the Ship Canal was opened up to the end of last season there have been
                        lauded at the port of Manchester nearly five and a-half million bales of
                        cotton.</p>
                    <p>So far as the present season was concerned, actual arrivals and "at sea" of
                        American cotton up to date amounted to 133,665 bales, against 102,921 bales
                        in the previous season, and for Egyptian the figures were 61.245 bales,
                        against 51,921 bales. Moreover, he was told that the bookings for Manchester
                        in America were very much ahead of last year. In consequence the shipowners
                        had increased their tonnage, and intended to do all they could to keep a
                        plentiful supply, so that there should be no lack of freight room. It
                        remained for the spinners to do their part and give all the support they
                        could to the direct importation of cotton to Manchester.</p>

                    <p>We were prevented from seeing "Le Passe" on Sunday, but we hear it was far
                        better than "Francillon," and most certainly last night's performance of
                        Sardou's "Espiome" marked a still greater improvement. It would be
                        unreasonable to say this performance surprised us; it could hardly do more
                        than come up to the high expectations we had formed of Mile Barthes; there
                        can be no doubt that she thoroughly proved herself the artiste that fame has
                        heralded. Her charm lies mainly in her splendid diction, which is the more
                        striking when contrasted with the apology for French that one hears over
                        here. Her voice, though leaving something to be desired on the score of
                        diversity, is wonderfully deep toned and so direct and sincere as to be
                        quietly convincing without need of any recourse to rant. "L'Es-pionne" has
                        no particular "star" part; the action is throughout maintained and well
                        dispersed, which at once enhances the value of the piece per se and enables
                        us to take stock of the accomplished players Mile Barthes has brought with
                        her. The love element of the play gives way a little before the intricacies
                        of diplomacy. This evidently cannot be depicted on the stage without one
                        falling in for stolen keys, secreted documents, and compromising letters.
                        The period dealt with is about 1849, and Andre de Maurillac is on a mission
                        - to Rome with important state papers. On his journey he falls in with and
                        marries Dora, who, no lets than her quaint Spanish mother, is regarded as a
                        somewhat shady char-, acter. On the day of their wedding the "Com-tssse"
                        Zicka, an adventuress in Austrian pay, being frustrated in her love for
                        Maurillao, manages to steal the most important of his papers in such a way
                        that the blame falls on Dora. This, together with a further false accusation
                        of her being the cause of the arrest of Tekli, a Hungarian patriot, is the
                        backbone of the play and elicited opportunity for some admirable scenes i
                        between Mile Barthes, as Dora, and M. Rous-selle, as Maurillac. At length
                        his friend Favrol les (M. Alerme) very cleverly wrests Zicka's secret from
                        her, and all ends happily for Mau-rillac and his wife. There is a good
                        "swing' and eclat about the whole play : no lame duck or stumbling-blocks.
                        If there was intense attrac tion in Mile Barthes, there was ample counter
                        attraction io Mile Marie Marcilly's graceful and refined interpretation of
                        Zicka, no less than in the finished performances of MM. Rouselle and Aderme;
                        we cannot, besides, omit mention of Mme Marie-Laur's Marquise though the
                        accent was a little too perfectly imperfect, and of M. Andre Hall's Tekli.
                        In fact, such a good ensemble in a touring com-pany reflects great credit on
                        Mile Barthes management and selection.</p>

                            <p>House of Commons.—Mr. Birrell stated that the Government had decided
                                to ask the House to return the Lords' amendments to the Education
                                Bill as a whole because they were destructive to the main principles
                                of the measure. He hoped the Lords would then substitute others with
                                a more limited scope. The Government was prepared to consider some
                                concessions, but anything like the present amendments were quite
                                unacceptable. If the Lords persisted in the matter the Bill would be
                                sacrificed. </p>
                            <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman will move a resolution to-morrow to this
                                effect. It is believed that this course is without precedent. A

                            <p>posed concessions has received the disapproval of a section of the

                            <p>In view of the separation law coming into force to-morrow, and the
                                Pope's prohibition of the religious associations provided for by it,
                                the Government has recently decided to facilitate religious services
                                under the law relative to ordinary public meetings, which
                                considerably modifies its requirements in favour of churches. The
                                Pope having now prohibited compliance with these, M. Briand, up to
                                the present most conciliatory, declares that the incitement to
                                violate ordinary law has entirely changed the situation. The
                                Government will act with energy equal to its previous conciliation,
                                and he has directed all breaches of the law to be prosecuted.</p>

                        thousands of square miles in extent, known as the Libyan Desert. The popular
                        conception of these interesting anomalies of the Sahara is that of a fertile
                        spot, lying amidst miles of sandy wilderness, something after the style of a
                        pleasant, pal u-clad Islet rising above the expanse of the Pacific Ocean.

                    <p>they are deep hollows consisting of a number of verdant patches sprinkled at
                        intervals over a carpet of desert, which only differs from the surrounding
                        waste on the plateau in its low-lying character.</p>
                    <p>The oases were begotten ages and ages ago when portions, of the limestone
                        rock of what is now the dreary expanse of the desert were upheaved. The
                        upper limestones were cracked by the violence of the upheaval and afterwards
                        denuded, thus forming slight hollows. Ages passed, and the hollows became a
                        lake, the water carrying on the work of excavation. When the moist climate
                        of Egypt became dry, a change, which may have been connected with the
                        revolution in the climatic conditions of Europe from a glacial to a
                        temperate state, the excavation still went on by means of wind and sand.
                        Century after century these great depressions became slowly larger owing to
                        the eroding force of the sand-laden blasts, and thus the oases were
                        sculptured into the present forms. But nature never stays her hand, and day
                        by day and year by year these hollows are still growing greater owing to the
                        erosion of the sandy wind, their boundaries ever encroaching on the desert
                        plateau, whose scarps are being ground gradually away. These hollows are
                        often of great extent. The oasis of Khargeh, for example, is as large as a
                        good-sized English county, being a depression three thousand square
                        kilometres in extent, a great part being desert. Bah arieh, the smallest of
                        all the oases, is not less than eighteen hundred square kilometres in size,
                        while Farafra and its pendent, the Iddaila oasis, which is only ten
                        kilometres distant, are each larger than Khargeh. Immense areas in Farafra
                        are quite unexplored, while Iddaila has never been explored at all, except
                        for a small portion at the north end. Utterly isolated from the valley of
                        the Nile they have remained aloof from the main stream of Egyptian history,
                        and Khargeh, alone of the oases, has a slight connection with two famous
                        events, the Persian conquest and the Nestorian heresy. Khargeh town was the
                        last civilised place which the host of Cambyses passed through on its way
                        from Thebes to Siwa and the remains of the 50,000 Persian warriors, who were
                        ever seen again by mortal eyes, lie somewhere in the surrounding desert,
                        their skeletons with their panoply preserved in the dry air, a treasure
                        trove for some future explorer of the Sahara. In the Christian era the Great
                        Oasis was the place of banishment for Nestorians the Heresiarch and' one of
                        the most unique remains of antiquity in Egypt is the great city of the dead,
                        the Necropolis of the Nestorians, who followed their Bishop, the victim of
                        Cyril's hatred, in his exile. Everywhere there are signs that the oases were
                        the flourishing centres of a large population in ancient times. Of late they
                        have become more and more depopulated, for as Egypt's prosperity increased,
                        large numbers of the younger men sought work in the Nile Valley. As the
                        people dwindled land went out of cultivation and the wells became sanded up
                        The ruins of Egyptian temples, Coptic chapels and monasteries, Roman castles
                        and aqueducts and sites of ancient wells attest how populous the country
                        once , was. In Khargeh, before the coming of the Corporation of Western
                        Egypt, practically all the wells used for irrigation and over a hundred that
                        had fallen into desuetude owed their origin to the ancient inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>Baharioh is more prosperous than Khargeh, and has a considerable export trade
                        in fruit, yet the area of land cultivated for cereals is said to be slowly
                        diminishing year by year. Twenty years ago 900 feddans were cultivated but
                        now there are only 600, the decrease being due to the diminished yield from
                        the springs owing to the inhabitants not taking sufficient measured to keep
                        the wells free. The villages are uninteresting collections of mud hovels
                        inhabited by an entirely Moslem population, there being no native Coptic or
                        Jewish elements. Originally the inhabitants of the oases were Libyan
                        (Berber) tribes, but after annexation to Egypt there was a considerable
                        immigration from Nubia and the Nile Valley. At the present time, while the
                        physiognomic type of the Berber race still predominates or is largely
                        present in Farafra, Baharieh, and Khargeh, in Dakhleh the in-</p>
                    <p>habitants differ little from the fellahaen of the Nile Valley </p>
                    <p>For thirty-five centuries the oases have been inhabited, as a discovery of a
                        stela of Thothmes II. in Baharieh proves it is doubtful whether they have
                        ever harboured less inhabitants or been more ackward, as regards the
                        resources of civilisation, than they have been during modern times. In 1897
                        the total population of these oases was as follows : Dakhleh, 17,090 :
                        Khargeh, 7,866 ; Baharieh, 6,081 ; and Farafra, 542. They are quiet and well
                        disposed, being unspoilt by contact with low-class Europeans. Before the
                        nineteenth century only two Europeans are known to have visited the oasis of
                        Khargeh, while the others were not entered until the last century, In fact
                        ever since the Arab conquest they appear to have been singularly neglected;
                        and Khargeh town, though of great antiquity, contains not a vestige of
                        Arabic architecture. It is totally unlike any town or village in Egypt
                        proper. The streets are simply low narrow tunnels under the -houses and
                        their darkness and intricacy are suggestive of a rabbit warren. Close to
                        this miserable capital of the Great Oasis, as if to remind the visitor of
                        the former prosperity of the land in comparison with its existing
                        degradation, rises the magnificent temple of Hibis which Darius I. built in
                        honour of Amen-Ra. The Persian King thought that by showing respect to the
                        Egyptian god and by public works of great utility to the country, he would
                        conciliate the people and make them grateful to tho Persian Occupation. But
                        like other alien occupants of Egypt the Persians were detested, and every
                        vestige of their century of occupation has been destroyed throughout the
                        length and breadth of the land, and except in this remote oasis no remains
                        exist of any public buildings of the Persian dynasty. The ruins of temples
                        erected in the times of the Ptolemies and of the Antonines in Khargeh and of
                        others in Baharieh built during the reigns of Apries and Amasis show that
                        the prosperity of the oases continued for many centuries. Olympio-dorus, in
                        the fourth century of our era, described the Egyptian oases as specially
                        celebrated for their fruitfulness and healthiness. "The trees," he declares,
                        "are constantly loaded with fruit, the corn grown in the oases being more
                        excellent than any other corn, and whiter than snow. Barley is sometimes
                        grown twice, and millet almost always three times a a year. Wells sunk to
                        &amp; depth of 200, 300, or even 500 cubits pour streams of water from their
                        mouths, which is the cause of the great fertility of the land, though the
                        sky is always cloudless."</p>
                    <p>Like many other valuable assets of the once mighty land of Egypt, the Oases
                        have suffered from the neglect of centuries—their glories have been dimmed,
                        the wells neglected, the Fund allowed to go out of cultivation, and the sand
                        to engulf what were once smiling farms and gardens. Modern enterprise is
                        already at work (repairing the damage done by the dark years of neglect and
                        adversity, new methods are. being employed, and ere long the oases of
                        Western Egypt will see the dawn of a prosperity greater than in the days of
                        the ancient Egyptians or of the Roman Occupation. As the heirs of the ages,
                        we shall reap where others have sown, and the harvest will be more abundant
                        than the ancient ever dared to hope for.</p>
                    <p>It is these oases which form the sphere of operations of the Corporation of
                        Western Egypt, and the most important land concession ever granted in modern
                        Egypt was made in 1903, when that company obtained the right during thirty
                        years of taking up land there with the object of irrigating and selling it
                        to a total extent of 600,000 feddans, or about 970 square miles. Three years
                        and a half have elapsed since then—although the term of the concession has
                        not yet begun to run - but owing to the inaccessible character of the
                        country, which the Corporation is developing, no independent account of the
                        progress of the work has up to now been possible. The description of the
                        scope and present position of the undertaking, which is to be published in a
                        series of articles of which this is the preface, should be of interest, for
                        there appears to be a considerable amount of ignorance and misunderstand ing
                        existing in Egypt as to the oases and the practicability of their successful
                        development. The object of these articles is to set before our readers the
                        story of the beginnings of a most important scheme, which can only be
                        brought to a successful issue by means of careful management and costly
                        development. We may add that from all that we have seen of the work now
                        being carried on in the Great Oasis, the Corporation of Western Egypt
                        appears to be honestly trying to carry through a vast undertaking which
                        should be of the utmost benefit to the country at large, for its goal is
                        nothing less than the restoration to Egypt of what was one of her most
                        fertile provinces, which has been utterly neglected and ignored ever since
                        the fall of the ancient world.</p>

                        <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>V Port Said, Satarday.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon, H. E. the Governor opened the International Sporting
                            Club's ground. There was a large and fashionable attendance among whom
                            were the Sub Governor and the various Consuls. Tue town band was in
                            attendance, and tea was provided for the fair sex. The most interesting
                            and amazing item on the programme was the Rugby football match between
                            the Club's team and a team from H. M. S. Veuns.</p>
                        <p>From a spectacular point of view the game was perhaps disappointing, as
                            it was almost exclusively confined to the forwards, who were pitiable
                            sights when half time was called The Governor kicked off at 3.30p.m.
                            sharp before some 200 spectators, and play settled down in midfield. The
                            Venus gradually worked down to oar line, and looked like souring, but
                            the pressure was relieved by a good kick by Wallis. Several scrums
                            ensued, the ship gradually working up the field again Gibbs made a
                            splendid effort to cross the line, but was hurled into touch right in
                            the corner. After several scrums the ball was touched down by Broatch.
                            Play was on our line when the whistle sounded half-time, with no
                            score.</p>
                        <p>The second half proved a little more in-teresting. Field made the first
                            opening for Port Said by intercepting a pass. He looked a scorer all,
                            over at the start and managed to get well into the ship's 25 before he
                            was palled down. A few minutes later Gibbs got possession and made a
                            good opening, but his pass to his wing was a little wild. The next ten
                            minutes were very exciting, the Venus making several attempts to score,
                            chiefly through Gibbs, who had exceeding hard line-in not scoring more
                            than once. Just before time was called two of the ship's forwards
                            crossed the line together and scored in the corner, but the try was
                            disallowed, both players being off-side. After a few minutes' scrambling
                            time was called.</p>
                        <p>Such a game does not call for much com-ment. Matters were fairly level
                            forward although the heeling of our forwards was very poor. The best man
                            on the field was Gibbs, the ship's centre three-quarter. The half-backs
                            played a good game, but were too inclined to resort to off side tactic ,
                            while their passes at times were rather wild. Field, for Port Said, made
                            some good openings, but his passes were always badly taken. Broatch at
                            full back was a tower of strength, and if was chiefly dae to this
                            player's grand defence that there was no score.</p>

                        <p>This match was played on the Institute ground at Gheziret Badrane on the
                            7th inst. Some time before the match commenced quite a respectable crowd
                            had tamed up and when the game started the fine large verandah was fall
                            of spectators. The homesters lost the toss and played with the sun in
                            their faces. They attacked early but the visitors soon transferred play
                            to the other end, where the Institute defence did very well to keep out
                            a series of hot attacks. The Institute forwards then made a good attempt
                            to score and the left wing had some very good tries. Both teams
                            struggled hard to obtain the lead, but half time arrived with no score.
                            On the restart the soldiers made some grand attempts to score and more
                            than once the home defence were very hard pressed-once Railway men,
                            however, soon found their feet and a ran up by the forwards ended in a
                            corner being forced. A goal resulted from the kick. The visitors then
                            made tremendous efforts to equalize, which they did from a penalty kick
                            given against an Institute back hr handling. Both teams made strenuous
                            Attempts to obtain the deciding goal but the final whistle blew with the
                            score 1 — 1. The tame was an exhibition of hard and interesting football
                            and was contested in the most gentle manly and sportsmanlike spirit.</p>

                    <head>[ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.]</head>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the pur poses set out in its Memorandum of
                        Associa tion, and especially to carry out business in Egypt and the Soudan.
                        The attention of the Board will, as opportunities present themselves, be
                        more particularly directed to :—</p>
                    <p>1. The purchase, development and subsequent leaning or re sale of
                        agricultural and building land.</p>
                    <p>2. The lending of money, on mortgage or otherwise on land or other approved
                        securities.</p>
                    <p>3. The carrying on of the business of an Investment Company.</p>
                    <p>The removal of all possibility of friction, due to the Anglo French
                        Agreement, end the confidence engendered by the certainty of a pro-tracted
                        British administration, has added the element of stability to Egypt which it
                        previously lacked.</p>
                    <p>That this vital fact is being realised is clearly shown by the remarkable
                        progress row being made in agriculture and commerce, which again is
                        reflected in the ever-increasing prosperity of the natives and the steady
                        ripe in value of all property. While the rise in land values during the last
                        few years has been remarkable, those who are best acquainted with the
                        conditions of the country and its people are emphatically of the opinion
                        that a further steady increase of prosperity and a corresponding improvement
                        in values is assured.</p>
                    <p>The increasing wealth of the natives, whose one form of investment is
                        agricultural land, coupled with the fact of their rapid numerical increase
                        and the natural limit imposed upon the cultivation of new land by the amount
                        of water available for irrigation, all tend to increase the capital and
                        rental values of such land as is either actually under cultivation or is
                        approaching that stage; in addition to which, there always remains the fact
                        that, even if the utmost. possibilities foreshadowed by Sir William Garstin
                        as to water supply were fulfilled, it is estimated by Mr. Lang Anderson that
                        at most about another one and a hall million acres could be brought into
                        agricultural use in the whole of Egypt, and that, only alter an expenditure
                        of over ten millions sterling, during a period of twenty years. At the end
                        of 1904. roughly five and a quarter million acres of land were he'd by about
                        one million owners, of whom nearly seven-eighth were native holders of less
                        than five acres each. With an estimated prevent population of about eleven
                        millions, which is steadily increasing at the rate of about 3 per</p>
                    <p>cent. per annum, and with a revenue and a foreign trade which have increased
                        over 60 and 100 per cent, respectively during the last 25 years, it would
                        appear that the expression used in Lord Cromer's Report of March last that
                        "the material prosperity of the country rests on a basis of somewhat
                        exceptional solidity" is amply justified</p>
                    <p>In view of the facts above seated this Com-pany will mainly devote itself to
                        the develop ment of selected agricultural estates with a view to their
                        rental or sale to natives in plots suitable to their requirements. Excellent
                        Opportunities frequently occur of lending money on first mortgage at good
                        rates and with an ample margin. With a local Advisory Board composed of
                        business men of high standing and long experience in Egypt good profits may
                        reasonably be expected from this and other forms of investment which require
                        special local knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Hicks Paull, the well-known Agri cultural Expert in Egypt, has
                        jumped the Advisory Board, and will act as the Company's technical adviser
                        for a period of three years.</p>
                    <p>The Company has acquired from The H. end J. Syndicate, Limited, the right to
                        purchase the Kom-EI-Akhdar estate of 4,793 feddans (say 5,000 English
                        acres), situated about 50 miles south of Alexandria, and connected by a
                        tramway, 1 1/2 miles in length, with The Delta Light Railways system. Mr. R.
                        Lang Anderson has reported to The H. and J.. Syndicate, Limited, upon the
                        property, and a copy of his Report is sent herewith.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted that he states that the supply of water appears to be
                        excellent and the property well supplied with main canals. That the soil
                        varies from a very light sandy loam to a heavy black loam, but is all
                        suitable for cultivation of the usual crops of Lower Egypt That the
                        principal buildings are in excellent condition, and quite sufficient for the
                        property. at present, but-more accommodation for tenants will have to be
                        built yearly as the land comes to the letting stare. That the number of
                        working bullocks is sufficient for reclamation purposes, and there is a good
                        supply of mules, horses and donkeys for transport work. The usual crops of
                        cotton, herseem, wheat and barley were doing well. That the property was
                        capable of great development at moderate cost. and if £30,000 were
                        judiciously spent on it during the next five years it could be brought to a
                        capital value of £75 to £80 per feddan That the work of development is
                        simple and follows well known lines, so that the element of unforeseen
                        contingencies was largely diminished. while the results of develop ment were
                        sure. That be advises the property is a good investment at £15 per feddan,
                        and confidently recommends the purchase. That if money on development is
                        well spent, the capital value will increase enormously yearly That the
                        present rental received is L.E. 3,841,600 (=£3,949 sterling), that is £4 per
                        feddan in respect of 980 feddans let, and he states that in his opinion,
                        when fully re-claimed, the whole of the property should let at an even
                        better rent—4 793 feddans at. say, £1.10. per feddan, would give an income

                    <p>The H. and J. Syndicate, Limited, have obtained an option on a valuable
                        property, of about 55,000 metres, at Rhoda Island, Cairo, which can be
                        secured by this Company at a satisfactory price.</p>
                    <p>The Directors have other business in view which is believed to be of a most
                        profitable venture ; as. however, negotiations are still in progress, it is

                    <p>15, Rue de la Gare de Ramleh, Alexandrie,</p>
                    <p>Egypt, 24th May 1906.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                    <p>KOM-EL-AHDAR PROPERTY.</p>
                    <p>Having visited the Kom-el Ahdar property,</p>
                    <p>I beg to report as follows : —</p>
                    <p>Situation - The property is well situated and easily got at, being About 50
                        miles south past of Alexandria and only 1 1/2 miles distant from
                        Kom-eI-Abdar Station on the Delta Light Railway, from which point there is a
                        60 centimetre tramway to the principal homestead.</p>
                    <p>Irrigation —The supply of water appeared to be excellent, ard the property is
                        wall supplied with main canals.</p>
                    <p>Drainage on the greater part of the Estate is good, but the drains are too
                        few in number and not deep enough. The whole property would greatly benefit,
                        in my opinion, by a closer and deeper system of canalisation. About 1,000
                        feddans, more or less, are comparatively low lying, and may require to have
                        their drainage pumped during part of the year to reclaim them properly.</p>
                    <p>Soil varies from a very light sandy loam to a heavy black loam, but is all
                        suitable for cul tivation of the usual crops of Lower Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Buildings.—The principal buildings, which Are in excellent condition, are
                        quite sufficient for the property, but more accommodation for tenants will
                        have to be built yearly as the land comes to the letting stage.</p>
                    <p>Stock —The number of working bollocks is sufficient for reclamation purposes,
                        ard there is a good supply of mules, horses, and donkeys for the transport
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Present Condition The usual crops of cotton berseem, wheat, and barley are
                        doing well, and on the high light, soil all round the principal dwelling
                        house. orange and lemon trees would grow well. On several parts of the
                        Estate the cotton was looking very well, but on other parts it was doing
                        badly, simply due, in my opinion, to haring been planted on land not yet
                        sufficiently reclaimed to grow the crop. Rice was being grown as a
                        reclamation crop, and would do batter it the drains were closer and deeper
                        and the land more carefully levelled before the crop was sown.</p>
                    <p>Future Development. The property is capable of great development at moderate
                        cost. If £30,000 judiciously spent on it during the next three years, it can
                        be brought to a capital value of £75 to £80 per feddan. The work of
                        development is simple and follows well known lines so that the element of
                        unforeseen contingencies is largely diminished, while the results of
                        development are sure.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion.—The property is a good investment At £4' a feddan. The revenue
                        for the first year or two will be small, but if the money on development is
                        well spent, the capital value will be increasing enormously yearly, and
                        later on the revenue will come in and go or- increasing until at least £400,
                        is reached. I can confidently recomend the purchase of this estate of 4.793
                        feddans, which, according to Mr Surgack's figures, has at present a
                        rental</p>
                    <p>of L.E. 3,841 600, from an area of 980 feddan let, which is slightly over £4
                        sterling per feddan ' and I see no reason why the whole of the properly,when
                        fully reclaimed should not do even better, as some of the let land is not,
                        in my opinion, quite ready to give to tenants, and if the proprietor had
                        kept is in his own bands for another year under reclamation crops he could
                        have got a higher rent.</p>

                        different classes, are taken from Mr. Sursock's figures. The Half Canal
                        Francaouia is a very valuable asset, but not Being lettable I have pot no
                        value against it. The land tax payable to Government varies from P.T. 5 to
                        P.T 57 per feddan, and. according to Mr. Sursock's figures, amounts at
                        present to LE. 653 646 mill, which is not heavy, as land tax runs, being
                        only an average of P.T. 13 3/5 per feddan but this, of course,will be
                        increased as the land is reclaimed.</p>

                        the date of the General Meeting they have disposed of lands in Cairo and

                        distribution of a dividend to the shareholders, and they have therefore

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
