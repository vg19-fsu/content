                        <p>A very amusing story is reported by the "Depêche Coloniale." Two torpedo
                            boats are kept at Harve under the charge of a non-commissioned officer.
                            The Vice-Admiral commanding the first naval district has just heard with
                            amazement that for a month past an individual, giving himself out as a
                            naval officer, has "taken command" of the Havre torpedo craft, making
                            the crews man the boats, dress the ship, and perform exercises almost
                            daily. He borrowed thǝ tunic of the non-commissioned officer in charge,
                            and tacked on epaulettes to suit the 'rank he had given himself, of
                            captain. A few days ago he disappeared, but in order, presumably, to
                            leave a good impression behind, he cancelled all punishment he had
                            inflicted. He is now being busily searched for. Whether his proceedings
                            are those of a practical joker, lunatic, or spy seems uncertain. </p>

                            morning and the company separated with many pleasant memories of a
                            charming fete. The music provided by the Society band, under the able
                            direction of Maestro Cav. U. Pucciarelli was executed with considerable
                            skill on the terrace, which was brilliantly illuminated by electricity.

                    <head>THE "OLIVEMOOR."<lb/>CREW LEAVES THE SHIP.</head>
                    <p>ARRIVAL OF SALVAGE STEAMER.</p>
                    <p>As reported in our issue of Saturday the position of the ,"Olivemoor" had
                        become so dangerous that a tug had been sent out to her to stand by to fetch
                        the crew ashore in the event of it being impossible for them to remain
                        aboard the stranded vessel. The tug arrived shortly after we had gone to
                        press and the same afternoon the crew left the boat. Behind the Porta and
                        Lights tug were towed two of the "Olivermoor's" boats, but so rough was the
                        sea that shortly after leaving Agami one of them broke away and was lost. </p>
                    <p>Thenceforth the boat was all but a derelict. Deserted compulsorily by her
                        crew, it was only by the captain standing by in a tug, that she could not be
                        lawfully claimed in ownership by the first who could step aboard her. The
                        shore is crowded by a hoarde of Bedouins, anxiously waiting for the ship to
                        break up that they may seize upon the wreckage. Driven hither and thither by
                        the coastguards, these wild sons of the desert retire to return in stronger
                        force, and should their avidity be increased by the sight of wreckage which
                        might become their booty it would be quite impossible for the small force of
                        coastguards to hold them back. Resistance would undoubtedly result in a
                        fierce fight between coastguards and Bedouins, and report says that of the
                        latter there are some two thousand. It is well-known to all that to the
                        Bedouins of the coast the possibility of securing booty is the strongest
                        incentive to fighting that one could offer them, and nought would they care
                        did a few of them fall in the attempt to obtain it. </p>
                    <p>As for the vessel, her position becomes worse almost every hour, and on
                        Saturday night she turned right round, her bow now pointing seaward.
                        Needless to say the hole in her bottom is becoming larger and larger, and
                        there is no doubt that she is on the pinnacle of a rock, which acts as a
                        pivot to aid her in her circular movements. The water, which up to Saturday
                        was confined to holds 1 and 2, is now filling her engine-rooms, and the "
                        Berger Wilhelm " will have a hard fight to save her from becoming a total
                        wreck. </p>
                    <p>At this point we would like to pay a just tribute to the manner in which the
                        captain, officers, and crew have conducted their work since they were placed
                        in their unfortunate position. Stranded for a week in a most dangerous
                        position, with a jagged rock penetrating the bottom of the boat, hoping
                        against hope for the sight of a salvage vessel to save a newly-built ship,
                        baulked by unpropitious winds and rough seas, pitched from side to side,
                        with the bolts and rivets threatening to give way with every movement of the
                        vessel, these men have performed what little lay in their power with stout
                        heart, and with the true stamina of the world-famed British sailor. Their's
                        has been a hard task, for they recognised that they were working against the
                        heaviest odds, while the hearts of the crew, who were working for their
                        families at home, must have been sad at the thought that should they have to
                        leave the ship, discharge was awaiting them ashore. But such is the law of
                        shipping, and such is the condition under which they signed. We can but
                        express the hope that other billets will speedily come their way. Meanwhile
                        they will be housed and boarded at the Seamen's Home, and at the first
                        opportunity will be offered passages to England. </p>
                    <p>At half past eight this morning we received a message to say that the salvage
                        steamer "Berger Wilhelm" was entering the pass in order to go through the
                        necessary formalities, such as taking practique, and to take in coal, on
                        completion of which she would proceed direct to the "Olivemoor" and commence
                        salving operations. The sea continues rough and the wind is blowing as
                        strongly as ever.</p>
                    <p>The situation, disastrous as it is, has not been without its glimpse of
                        humour. This morning a gentleman to whom had been consigned two trunks of
                        patterns for suitings etc., called at the agency of the company to impress
                        upon them the urgency of saving his consignment, even if nothing else could
                        be salved. He suggested sending out a special tug to attempt their rescue,
                        for they were worth, he said, £5,000. The impractibility of his suggestion
                        was pointed out to him and he was told that in all probability they had been
                        spoilt by the water, which floods the vessel. "Impossible," he cried, "I've
                        got the key in my pocket !" </p>
                    <p>Later. </p>
                    <p>Most unsatisfactory reports on the situation of the "Olivemoor" continue to
                        reach us and. just as we are going to press a message comes to hand that the
                        vessel is practically "done for". So strong is the wind and so rough the sea
                        that we understand there is little chance of the "Berger Wilhelm" being able
                        to start operations before tomorrow morning. </p>
                    <p>Latest News. </p>
                    <p>The Captain of the "Berger Wilhelm" is going to make an effort to reach the
                        "Olivemoor" this afternoon and, if possible, will commence operation&amp;
                        The vessel is now quite full of water. </p>

                    <p>We have just received a report from Captain H. G. Lyons, D.Sc., F.R.S., on
                        the work of the Survey Department in 1906. The two principal features of the
                        work were the completion of the cadastral survey and the publication of
                        about one-quarter of the general map of the Nile Valley and the Delta on the
                        scale of 1:50,000. In this report some statistics are given of the cadastral
                        survey, but it is proposed to treat this more fully in a special report. The
                        organisation of the Department remains as it was last year, viz. :—(1)

                    <p>In the central office are included not only the administrative staff of the
                        department, but also certain important sections which are engaged in
                        branches of work necessary for the completion of the different classes of
                        surveying, as well as the lines of investigation to which these give rise.
                        These sections are :— </p>
                    <p>(1) The Computation Office, in which the mathematical control and discussion
                        of the observations made in the course of surveying operations are carried
                        out, as well as all calculations required for the accurate drawing and
                        reproduction of maps. The superintendence of the meteorological stations and
                        the preparation of the observations taken at them for publication also fall
                        to the charge of this section. </p>
                    <p>(2) The reproduction office, in which all maps and plans are prepared, as
                        well as diagrams and other similar work for the illustration of reports and
                        publications. </p>
                    <p>(3) The laboratory, where rocks, ores, and minerals of the geological survey
                        are examined, the gas supply of Cairo is photometrically controlled,
                        materials such as paints, oils, lime, cement, asphalt, etc., are analysed to
                        see that they are in conformity with specification, the water-supply of
                        Cairo, is analysed weekly, as well as the river water and the silt which the
                        Nile carries in suspension during a large portion of the year. The precise
                        survey is entrusted with the first order ( geodetic ) and second order
                        triangulation, the precise levelling, and the charge of the meteorological
                        observatory at Helwan.</p>
                    <p>The topographical survey executes the third and fourth order triangulation,
                        the preparation of topographical maps on 1:10,000 and smaller scales, the
                        survey of towns, and hydrographic surveying, levelling, and gauging in the
                        Nile Valley.</p>
                    <p>The cadastral survey prepares the 1:2,500 maps showing property boundaries,
                        and the land registers which accompany them, together with all corrections
                        to these and their revision.</p>
                    <p>The geological survey is employed in map-ping and describing the geological
                        structure of the country.</p>
                    <p>A considerable amount of information, of both scientific and technical value,
                        is constantly being accumulated in the Survey Department, although in many
                        cases the investigation on any one subject does not go far enough to furnish
                        material for a full report on it. In order that such information may be
                        rendered available, the Ministry of Finance has authorised the publication
                        from time to time of "Survey Department Papers" in which work of technical
                        or scientific value will be presented. Each paper will deal with a single
                        piece of work in as complete a form as the material available will admit,
                        and every effort will be made to include a full account of all earlier work
                        on the subject which may have been done in this country. It is hoped that in
                        this way pieces of research may be rendered available to other scientific
                        workers without the necesity for the long delay often caused by waiting
                        until an exhaustive treatise can be prepared. This will also allow the
                        annual report on the work of the department to be restricted to a teport of
                        progress only, and will avoid the inclusion in it of the results of research
                        work which may thereby he difficult of access.</p>
                    <p>At the present time two such papers have been published, viz. :—"A

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN INDUSTRIAL </head>
                    <p>Since the crisis in Egyptian finance a few months ago as a result of the
                        over-speculation in land we have not heard a great deal of Egyptian
                        enterprises, although there are many progressive industrial undertakings
                        well worthy of the attention of the investor. Now that matters have settled
                        down quietly again one is disposed to look round for shares of a sound
                        nature that have been unduly depressed by the temporary financial stress in
                        the country. In this connection we may direct attention to the company well
                        known here, and even better throughout the land of the Pharaohs, as Egyptian
                        Markets, Limited. This concern, which has been established some nine or ten
                        years, is not interested in land, as most of the enterprises promoted in
                        this country are, but owes its origin to a concession granted by the
                        Egyptian Government for the construction and management of official markets
                        throughout both Upper and Lower Egypt. The concession being a Government
                        grant constitutes what practically amounts to a monopoly so far as the
                        specified localities are concerned, so that the company has nothing to fear
                        in the way of competition. The idea of the Government in granting this
                        concession was to endeavour to stamp out cattle diseases, which at one time
                        were of a very serious nature in Egypt. At first the company had very many
                        difficulties to contend with in this respect, but as time went on these
                        difficulties gradually grew less, until the company has become, through
                        sound and methodical principles, so successful in stamping out disease that
                        the Egyptian Government have extended the period of the company's original
                        grant by some fifteen years, The capital is, roughly, £174,700 in £1 shares,
                        the whole of which is insured for repayment by a series of policies
                        maintained annually out of revenue, so that shareholders will receive back
                        in full their original capital whenever the properties revert to the
                        Government. It is here interesting to see the gross receipts and dividends
                        paid for each of the past three years :—</p>

                    <p>It should be pointed out that in 1903 there was a serious outbreak of cattle
                        plague, so that both in that year and the following year no dividends were
                        paid, although in the latter year a dividend was earned. as will be readily
                        seen from the above figures. We have already said that this cattle-plague
                        difficulty is gradually being wiped out, so that fear in this respect need
                        now be only of a minor character, as the company is in a position to very
                        effectively check outbreaks in fact, so successfully is this now done that
                        the directors take very little notice of an outbreak. As an instance of the
                        progress made .during the current year by the company, it may be noted that
                        the gross revenue to date amounts to £25,892, and compares with £21,809 for
                        the same period last year, thus showing an increase of some £3,583. This
                        rate of advance is satisfactory, to say the least, especially as it is
                        derived from the markets alone, and likely to be very materially increased
                        when other sources of enterprise which the company has in hand commence to
                        operate. Amongst these the company has undertaken—and lately made an issue
                        of 50,000 new shares at 27s. 6d. per share for that purpose—the sale and
                        distribution of nitrates in Egypt, for which with their 120 market centres
                        they have unrivalled facilities. Apart from this, arrangements have just
                        been completed with the two concerns in Egypt who practically between them
                        own the salt monopoly for the Egyptian Markets to act as sole distributing
                        agents for salt. It is thought that these latter arrangements are likely to
                        have an enormous influence upon the company's earnings at an early date,
                        especially in connection with the nitrate, for which there is an
                        exceptionally keen demand throughout the whole of the country for
                        agricultural purposes. People well informed as to the conditions prevailing
                        are confident that the dividends will steadily advance to an ultimate goal
                        of 20 per cent. at least, and, considering the prospects, the shares appear
                        a cheap investment at the current price of about 29s., at which figure they
                        are apparently being quietly absorbed by shrewd market individuals.</p>

                    <p>By the retirement of Colonel James Magill, M.D., C.B., the Royal Army Medical
                        Corps will be deprived of the services of a most capable officer, whose good
                        work in Egypt and the Transvaal has been highly appreciated. Colonel Magill,
                        who was appointed a surgeon in 1876, was for many years associated with the
                        Coldstream Guards, and was present with the camel corps throughout the
                        Soudan campaign of 1884-85, during which he was severely wounded at the
                        battle of Abu Klea, receiving for his services mention in despatches, the
                        medal with two clasps, and the Khedive's Star. As Principal Medical Officer
                        to a division, he saw most of the important engagements of the recent South
                        African war, including the battles of Belmont, Enslin, Modder River,
                        Magersfontein, and the subsequent operations in Cape Colony, again obtaining
                        mention in despatches, two medals with no fewer than eight clasps, and the
                        Companionship of the Bath. In 1904 he was gazetted to the rank of
                        Surgeon-Colonel, and in the following year became Principal Medical Office
                        in Egypt.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN 1907</head>
                    <p>In reviewing the cotton movements during the past season, the "Manchester
                        Guardian" states : Egyptian cotton has ruled high during the season, with
                        some violent fluctuations. The lowest price of the season occurred very
                        early. Fully good fair on the spot at Liverpool was at 9 15-16d. on
                        September 1 and at 9 1/2d. on Ootober 4, but March contracts were lowest on
                        September 1, and so was Alexandria. The highest point touched was on March
                        4—viz, 11 5/8d. on the spot at Liverpool, with July con-tracts at 11 38-64.
                        and Alexandria at 24.10. From those prices values fell to 10 1/16d. for
                        Liverpool spot on April 25 and to 18.9 for November in Alexandria. The crop
                        has proved the largest on record, and so has the consumption. The deficiency
                        of high grade long-stapled American has assisted the demand for Egyptian.
                        Financial depression in Alexandria has of late affected the market, and the
                        hoarding of gold up country by the fellaheen cultivators has, it is said,
                        contributed to the difficulties. Guesses as to the size of the coming crop
                        run from 7,250,000 to 7,500,000 cantars.</p>
                    <p>The season closes with a visible supply of 1,302,110 bales of American
                        cotton, against 864,530 a year ago. The stock of American at Liverpool is
                        658,760 bales, against 298,220. The total visible supply of American for
                        Great Britain is 666,760 bales, against 333,220 in 1906. The current price
                        of middling American is 7.46., against 5.41d. in 1906. </p>

                        Commander-in-Chief of the Island of Malta and its dependencies is
                        gazetted.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Fitzdeorge, the eldest son of the Duke of Cambridge, who passed away
                        at Lucerne last week, came out to Egypt in 1882 on the personal staff of
                        General Sir Garnet Wolseley. He was present at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir,
                        and carried back to London the despatch announcing the British victory. For
                        his services in the campaign he was rewarded with the brevet of lieutenant
                        colonel, the medal with clasp, the Fourth Class of the Osmanieh, and the
                        Khedive's Star. Colonel FitzGeorge retired from the Army in 1895. </p>
                    <p>The marriage took place, at the Parish Church, Richmond, Yorkshire, on the
                        28th ult., of Mr. John Monteith Furness, M.A., of Cairo, and Miss Alice
                        Diana Croft, third daughter of Mr. C.G. Croft, of the Bailey House,
                        Richmond, </p>
                    <p>The marriage took place on Saturday afternoon of Mr. L. L. Polity, of the
                        Bank of Athens, to Miss Cleopatra Marcopoulo at Mr. Zouro's, uncle of the
                        bride, residence. The ceremony was conducted by Mgr. Theophanos. A large
                        number of friends of both bride and bridegroom were present and many
                        beautiful presents were displayed. The guests were most hospitably
                        entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Zouro and Mr. John Joannides, manager of the
                        Bank of Athens, who acted as best man. After the ceremony a merry evening
                        was spent by the party and the evening ended with a most enjoyable dance,
                        which lasted until after midnight. The happy couple are spending their
                        honeymoon at the New Victoria Hotel, Ramleh.</p>

                    <p>The "North German Gazette" in commemorating the accession of the Sultan's
                        accession, makes reference to the Hejaaz Railway, and remarks :—</p>
                    <p>"The promotion of this enterprise," it is added, "testifies to Abdul Hamid's
                        great political far-sightedness, since the line which starts from Damascus
                        binds the Hejaaz region and with it the holy places of Islam, Mecca, and
                        Medina more closely to the rest of the Turkish Empire, and firmly attaches
                        the stream of Musulman pilgrims to the Turkish railway which is now being
                        constructed in the track of the old pilgrim highway. Under Abdul Hamid's
                        rule the authority of the Sultan, as compared with former days, has already
                        grown appreciably in those regions which are so important for Islam, and the
                        inevitable result of the construction of the railway will he still further
                        to strengthen his position." </p>

                        68, has been sworn at £258,990 gross with net personalty £258,590. His will,

                        Blackwater, and nominated her sole executrix, and declared that she was also

                    <p>Mr. Edward E. Lang, in the "Contemporary Review," discusses "The All-India
                        Moslem League," and points ont its vital differenee from the Indian Congress
                        movement. The intentions of these Moslem reformers are, the writer
                        maintains, such as should commend them to English sympathies. </p>
                    <p>No Britisher need have cause to fear the formation of the All-India Moslem
                        League. Its object is to help the Government of India in the administration
                        of that country, not to hinder it. It has nothing whatever to do with
                        Pan-Islamism, although persons are sure to come forward who will discover
                        all kinds of alarming evidence, manufactured to suit their own purpose, to
                        prove that the Sultan of Turkey and the Khedive of Egypt have been the prime
                        movers in the formation of the League, which the former intends to use to
                        make thoroughly sound his power as Khalifa. Its birth signifies that
                        Mahomedans now claim that right to which every free-born man is entitled of
                        combining with his fellows to protect his interests, and its watchword is
                        "defence, not defiance."</p>
