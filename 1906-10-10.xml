                    <head>THE MOHAMEDANS OF INDIA.</head>
                    <p>In the strange and romantic history of British rule in India, no incident of
                        a pacific character has been more remarkable than the presentation last week
                        to the Vicerory of the Mohamedan memorial. Its significane, says the "Daily
                        Telegraph," is two-fold. In the first place, the sincere and unambiguous
                        declaration of loyalty to the Raj, sponstaneously made in the name of the
                        Mohamedans of India, comes opportunely at a moment when there is a
                        determined effort in the Nearer EAst to foment a Pah-Islamic agitation. It
                        is by no means certain that this movement was originated by Mualems. It is
                        very well known konw that one of the causes of the Sultan's obduarcy with
                        regard to the Turco-Eguptian boundary was the urgency with which some of his
                        representatives in the Khediavale assured him that any weakening on his part
                        would be followed bu a succession from the faith to the part of Egyptian
                        Mohamedans. In the second place, the organization and character of the
                        deputation which waited upon Lord Minto constituted a counterbalst to the
                        aims and methods of certain Hindu politicans under the leadership of Mr.
                        Surendra Nath Banergee. These Badu incendiaries have not restricted
                        themselves to constitutional forms of agitation, though their machinery and
                        their ideals are borrowed wholesale from the West. Banda and banners and
                        processions do not appeal to the "brooding East" ; but any suggestion of
                        religious or radical oppression is eagerly listened to and easily
                        exaggerated. Englishmen and Anglo-Indians - all but a few - took years to
                        realise that there was a genuine grievance in the story of the "greased
                        cartridges," which was the occasion, though not the cause, of the Mutiny.
                        The West, in its haste and hurry, soon forgets; the East remembers. The
                        Bengali agitators have not forgotten the greased cartridges and their
                        sequel. The breechloader has rendered that cry obsolete, but today the
                        political heirs of the mjtineers are telling Mohomedans that sugar they
                        consume is refined with pigs blood, and the Hindus are informed that the
                        blood of cows is used the same purpose. With these sedition-mongers the
                        Mohamedan population will have nothing to do. The deputation which waited
                        upon Lord Minto "gratefully acknowledged the peace, security, and liberty of
                        the person and of worship conferred by the British Government, emphasising
                        the fact one of the most imporatnt charactersitics of British rule was the
                        deference paid to the veiws and wishes of all the races and religions of
                        India."</p>
                    <p>It may resonably be asked: Why, if the Mohamedans are satisfied with their
                        condition , should they think it worth while to memorialise the Viceroy at
                        all. The answer is not far to seek. Though India had a civilisation, a
                        polity, and a literature many centuries before England, in none of the
                        innumberable chances and changs which have overtaken her heterogeneous
                        inhabitants has the seef of self-government ever taken root. Indeed, it
                        never was sown. Self-government, as we understand the word, is purely
                        Teutonic in origin, and has only developed naturally amongst people of
                        Teutonic blood. And pride of race has led Anglo-Saxons to believe that the
                        form of constitution that best adapated their genius and traditions must be
                        beat adapted to the needs of all races under the sun. Radicials became
                        almost Turcophil when, for a month or two, a Parliament was in existence in
                        Constantinople, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman only echoed the race
                        arrogance when he declared, "The Duma is dead; long live the Duma!" If the
                        Hindu movement in favour of self-government for India were spontaneous and
                        indigenous, it would be worthy of all consideration. But it is an extoic,
                        imported from allen climes. The political slang, the catchwords, the
                        emblems, the ideas emploued by the agitators might have been turned out of
                        the literary factory of the National Liberal Federation. There is a very
                        small percentage of Anglo-Indian retired Civil Servants who support and
                        encourage the "mild Hindu." Of course there is. The system by which we
                        selecet our Indian Civil Service - though undoubtedly the best available -
                        is certain to produce a minority of clever cranks, who, though capable of
                        passing every kind of "examination," are most ignorant of human nature than
                        their native servants. A few of them, reutrn home with pensions at a
                        comparetively early age, get themselves elected for Parliament, and talk
                        plausible nonsense to ignorant people in the House of Commons and on public
                        platforms. And gradually these persons, doctrinaire Radicals of the most
                        unpratical kind, impress upon their countrymen the idea that India is
                        clamouring for self-goverment. India is not clamouring. But self-government
                        in some form may be thrust upon her, and the Mohamedans who waited on Lord
                        Minto only asked that if the "blessing" is granted, they and their
                        co-religionists should be duly represented. Lord Minto's reply - discussed,
                        no doubt, in anticipation with Mr. John Morley - was admirable. "Hope and
                        ambitions," he said, "new to India are making themselves felt. We cannot
                        ignore them. I should be wrong were I to wish you to do so but what is all
                        this unrest due. Not to the discontent of misgoverned milllions. I defy
                        anyone honestly to assert that. Nor is it due to any uprising of disaffected
                        people. It is due to that educational growth in which only a very small
                        portion of the population has yet shared, of which British rule first sowed
                        the seed, and the fruit of which British rule is now doing its best to
                        foster and direct. There may be many tares in the harvest we are now
                        reaping. The Western grain which we have sown may not be entirely suitable
                        to the requirementes of the people of India." This is sound commonsense, and
                        must comforted the Mohamedans, but we fear that to the Surrendra Nath
                        Banerjees it will prove a stumbling-block, and to the Cottons and
                        KeirHardies foolishness, or at least irony.</p>

                    <p>The celebrated tragedienne, Signora Adelaide Ristori, is dead. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>The Marquise del Grillo, nee Adelaide Ristori, trafic actress, was born at
                        Cividale, in Friuli, in 1821, being the child of a poor actor, and was
                        trained at a very early age for the stage. She appears to have risen through
                        a long series of struggles to the eminence she ultimately attained. Having
                        accepted in 1855 an engagement in Paris, she sought the favour of a French
                        audience as a interpreter of the tragic muse at the very time that Rochel
                        was in the zenith of her fame. Her appearance at such a period was regarded
                        by the French as an open challenege to contest the supremacy of their tragic
                        queen, and they assembled much more dispoed to criticise than to applaud.
                        The genius of Ristori, however, trimphed, and from that moment her position
                        was unassailed. Her reception in England was equally enthusiatic, and she
                        appeared in Spain in 1857, in Hollan in 1860, in Russia in 1861, at
                        Constainople I 1864, in the United States and other parts of the world, with
                        success. William I. of Prussia gave her the medal in sciences and in arts in
                        1862. Amongst her most famous characters are those of Medes, Lady Macbeth,
                        Fazio, Phaedra, Deborah, Judith, Franceca da Riviera, and Camilla. After an
                        absence of fifteen yars, Madame Ristori again appeared in London, June 11,
                        1878, and on Nov. 8 in that year she took her farewell of the English stage
                        at Queen's Theatre, manchester. She appeared again, however, on a few
                        occasions in the year 1882, and acted Lady Macbeth with all her old
                        distinction if with some lack of fire. In 1887 she published "Estudes et
                        Souvenire." She was married to the Marquis Capranica del Grillo.</p>

                    <p>A special commerical agent has made a report to the United States Burean of
                        manufactures upon the possibilities of enlarging the volume of experts to
                        Egypt. At present these are not aufficiently important to trecieve
                        particular classification in the Egyptian returns. For the fiscal year 1906
                        the United States took from Egypt goods to the value of $9,391,621, to which
                        Egyptian cotton was by far the largest contributor, but the balye of the
                        exports to Egypt was only $1,163,128. Our American friends seem almost
                        unduly anxious to extend their export tade, and it is suggested that the
                        backwardness in this cases in due mainly to inadequate steamship connection
                        are blamed for the loss of business in locomotives and in bridge-bulding. It
                        is said that there is an opportunity for American enterprise in the demand
                        for agricultural machinery, electrical applicanes, and motor-cars. On the
                        whole the summary of the report gives the impression that the desired end
                        has not been brought much nearer.</p>

                        has not yet been accepted by the Emperor Menelik, as the convention, it is
                        believed, has caused some dissatifaction amoung certain groups of financiers
                        at Menelik's Court, who habe succeeded in convincing him that the Powers
                        concerned must have had a peculiar idea of his independence when they took
                        the liberty of settling Abyssinian affairs without his consent. These
                        financiers habe advised him to resist, and he accordingly refuses to ratify

                    <p>A correspondent writes:- The following passage from a leading article in a
                        recent issue of the "Daily Telegraph," reporduced in the "Egyptian Gazette"
                        of the 6th inst., deserves special notice at the present moment:-</p>
                    <p>"The outcry against the punishment of the Egyptian villagers who act upon and
                        murdered some British officers has hardly yet died away. Lord Cromer's
                        measured warning to the Home Government of the growth of a fanatic
                        anti-British agitation in Egypt is either derided, byt these
                        'anti-nationalist,' or it is accepted as natural and worthy of all
                        sympathy."</p>
                    <p>Is not the use of the word "Some" in this connection an exaggeration so gross
                        as to amount to a perversion of the truth. the "outcry" has not died away,
                        nor will it be allowed to do so as long as hournalists and others in a more
                        respoinsble positions are constatnly allyding to it whilst distorting the
                        clearly proved facts. It is easy to carp at the natove Moslem newspapers for
                        their mistatementa of facts in roder to prove their points, but it is at the
                        same time the duty of fairminded Englishmen to show that it is not only the
                        vernacular Press which is guilty of perverting the truth as to the Denishwai
                        affair, and that an imporatnt London Imperialist oragan, such as is
                        the"Daily Telegraph," can be proved to be quite as prone to texaggerate most
                        grossly in the other direction. Many readers of the aritlce in question
                        will, froma persual of the allegatio to which I have drawn attention, come
                        to a hazy conclusion that there was regular massacre of British officers.
                        The public memory is proverbially ahort, and after a few months the details
                        of the denishwai business are to most people in England of the flimisiest
                        kind. Most, no doubt, after all the talk that has subsequently ensured about
                        Egyptian unrest and Pan-Islamism, consider it as a deliberately planned
                        outrage instigated by the emissaries od the Sultan and, aided by such
                        untruths as that in the "Daily Telgraph," they naturally conclude that Egypt
                        is in a state of furious turmoil. The "Egyptian Gazette" is, in my opinion,
                        a very impartial organ, and I have therefore addressed these remarks to you,
                        Sir, as I think some protest should be made against such gross
                        exaggeration.</p>
                    <p>We willingly print the letter of our correspondent as the statement in our
                        London contemporaty deserves to be notes. The exaggeration of the London
                        Conservative newspaper that "some" British officers were murdereded is on a
                        par with the perservsions in Mr. Blunt's pamphlet or in the vernacular
                        novel, "the Virgin of Denishwai." They show that that the Denishwai Affair
                        is gadually entering on a mythoric process and soon all attempts to obtain
                        any unbaiseed opinion on the matter will be beyond the scope of the human
                        intellect, for it appears to be one of those incidents, like the Drefus
                        Affair, which seem destined to be distorted by every person who attempts to
                        arrive at a conclusion on the subject.</p>

                        been through that there are many persons in the city and neighbourhood who
                        would be glad of opportunities of meeting regularly to have news of recent

                    <p>Hussein Bey El-Bskri, of Damietts, has contributed L.E. 1,000 for the
                        proposed National University, Mohamed Pasha Muhein L.E. 200, and Sauid
                        Mahmoud El Soursi L.E. 500.</p>
                    <p>Sayid Mohamed, a merchant of Gamaleih, who was reported by the "Lewa" to have
                        subscribed L.E. 1,500. writes to that paper to contradict the statement.</p>
                    <p>The news of the enormous donation of L.E. 100,000 from Aly Pasha Fahmy, which
                        was recently published by "Al-Minbar." proves to be unfounded. Interviewed
                        in regard to the matter, his Excellency merely stated that he would
                        contribute a sum towards the scheme when the committee had been composed and
                        the president elected.</p>

                    <p>Mohamed Bey Fraid, who orginated the scheme of giving a barquet in honour of
                        Mustapha Pasha Kamel, writes to "Al Lewa" saying that the money collected
                        for the purpose of the reception has now been placed in the Bank of
                        Salonics, ready to be paid over to the committee of the National University
                        as ssoon as it has commenced its labours.</p>
                    <p>The meeting of the subscribes, for the election of an organising committee,
                        will be held at the residence of Saad Bey Zaghloul, councillor in the
                        Natiove Court of Appeal, at Iosha, on Friday next.</p>
                    <p>It is stated that number of Syrian notables, resident in Cairo, met yesterday
                        evening in order to consider the scheme of the proposed National University.
                        Some of them intend to subscribe a considerable amount towards the

                    <p>The ceremony was very ably conducted by W. Bro Button, P.G.S, and all those
                        who had the good fortune to be present were much impressed by the solemnity
                        of the proceedings. The installation of the W. Master and officers was next

                        <p>Sir, - There was a notable omissin in your report of the fire at Sochutz
                            last (Monday) night. When the Alexandria Fire Brigade appeared on the
                            scene there was not a drop of water available. The police did all they
                            possibly could. They telephoned for water to the Alexandria Water
                            Company and sent mounted policemen post haste to the company's station
                            at Hagar Nawatieh. All their efforts, however, were fruitless.</p>
                        <p>Not a drop of water was obtainable. The result was that the house was
                            completely gutted and, had there been a wind, the houses in the
                            immediate neighbourhood would habe fallen a prey to the flames. How long
                            will the inhabitatnts of Ramleh remain callous of the terrible danger
                            which menaces them owing to the extraordinary conduct of the Alexandria
                            Water Company - Truly yours,</p>

                        <head>THE STREETS OF CAIRO.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir, - The streets of Cairo are in such a condition, owing to
                            road-mending, house building, and similary operations, that it is
                            becoimng almost impossible to either walk or drive with safety.
                            Buildings must be erected and road must be mended, but Cairenes have the
                            right to demand that some atttention should be paid to their daftey and
                            comfort. In many quarters the Government are infringing their own
                            regulations by recumbering the pavements with repairing materials and,
                            such being the case, they cannot but countenance the unnecessary
                            blocking of the pathways by building contractors.</p>
                        <p>In a recent leading article you remakred upon the sad lack of traffic
                            control in Ciairo. We have hoped for better things by the drafiting of
                            men from the Police School, but matters certainly have not been improved
                            by these "boys" - for such they appear both in age and intellect.</p>
                        <p>I should also like to remark upon the ruin of our once beautiful suburb.
                            Ghizeh. Its glory has gone for ever and Cairo is being robbed of one
                            more life supporting lung. all is bein gbuilt over - the Wakf land, the
                            land between the river and the road, those beautiful gardens south of
                            the old Museum, which stretched to the Ghizeh Reformatory. Those lovely
                            gardens, once the pride of Cairo, have vanished beyond recall. Oh that
                            these destroyers would stay their hands and remember that "God the first
                            garden made, and the first city Cain." - Yours, etc., CAIRENE.</p>

                        <p>Sir, - In reference of the various theories of your correspondents as to

                            to point out that it is improbable that the machinery of the streamer
                            was imperfect, or out of order, as she no doubt has a passengers'
                            certificate from the Board of Trade, delcaring from one date to another
                            that she is in a fit and proper condition to convey mails, passengers,

                        <p>Dear Sir, - I recently spent a few days in a town on the banks of the
                            Nile situate between the stations of Armant and Kous. Throughout my
                            sojourn I was never quite clear in my mind as to whether I was really
                            staying at Luxor, for on reference to my map of the district the only
                            name which I could find in the precise region where I imagined myself to
                            be was splet El Uksor. A few days later received a letter from the place
                            where I thought I had been, but the postmark was Louqsor. Subsequently I
                            had occasion to visit a village between the station of Michta (or
                            Mecheta) and Sidfs (or Sedfa). It was evening, and I had lasped into a
                            transiet slumber in the corner of my carriage. "To sleep; perchance to
                            dream: ay, there's the rub," and my dreams had carried me back to my
                            student days. I was aroused by the train slowing up and on entering the
                            station I received a "coup d'ceil" in the shape of the legend "Time"
                            brought into strong relief against the blackness of the night by a (1)
                            candlepower lamp. Was this a continuity of my dream in which I had heard
                            that very word echoing through the halls of gaily lighted tavern. I
                            hurriedly consulted my watch and time table and, placing strict reliance
                            in both, I should have arrived at Tema. Where I had just been reading an
                            Eue's Fruit Salt advertisment in illustrated paper heaed "Time" with a
                            pictured presentement o fth ehoary headed avenger armed with a seythe.
                            It was all very bewildering and - where was I.</p>
                        <p>Did Shakespeare live at Guerga in the present day he might vary the
                            spelling of his dwelling place as frewuently as the spelling of his
                            name, claiming the authority of the Railway, Postal, or Survey
                            Administration for most of his departures. Probably, though, he would
                            adhere to one method; at least we have no reason to thick the contraty.
                            Shall I multiply instance. Remembering the Eno's Fruit Salt advertisment
                            and the stentorian voice of my dreams, I stay my pen. Was President
                            Roosevelt travelling incognito in Egypt during last winter. - Yours

                            <p>The President of the "Union of Russian People" harangued a gang of
                                300 members exhorting them to exterminate the rebels and the Jews.
                                Russia, he said, wanted neither Consitution nor Parliament but
                                Orthodoxy and Autocracy. The gang rushed into the streets shouting
                                "Death to the Jews." All the shops were instantly closed. The Jews
                                became panic-stricken. The Perfect intervened and averted a

                    <head>THE BRONZE AND IRON AGES.</head>
                    <p>The recent discoveries in Egypt and chaldea have thrown geat light upon the
                        relative sequence of the store, brenza, and iron ages in the East; and this
                        evidence is particularly important, as Dr. Fr. Gnether, in the current
                        number of the "Scientific American," proceeds to advocate the theory that
                        "The age of bronze was a myth." The statements which the author makes in
                        supporting his theory show an extraordinary lack of knowledge of recent
                        archeological discoveries. After refering to the fact that in the pyramid
                        age, about B.C. 3800, the Egyptians worked such hard materials as
                        Prophy-bassalt and granite, he says that "there is abundant evidence that
                        the Egyptians were acquainted with iron - not the soft, spongy iron of
                        barbarian races, but steel." Furthermore he makes the statement that bronze
                        was not known in Egypt in the fourth dynasty, when the pyramids were
                        built.</p>
                    <p>The reseraches of M. de Morgan at Nagada and Professor Perrie at Abydos show
                        that bronze was known, and fashioned into small tools for carving stone and
                        ivory in the later Neolitic age. The recent reseraches of Professor Petrie
                        in Sinai show that the copper mines there were worked in the time of the
                        first dynasty. The authority of Hartland is given for the existence of
                        deposits of iron and heaps of slag in the Wasy Magarreh. These so-called
                        heaps of slag are now known to be the reamins of burnt offerings at the
                        sacred cave of Hathor. There is, however, ample evidence that the bronze age
                        and the stone age in Egypt continued side by side until at least the time of
                        the twelfth dynasty, B.C. 2800, when the use of iron for tools or weapons
                        never bevome general in Egypt until certainly B.C. 900. No dependence is to
                        be placed on the supposed discovery of an iron fool in the great pyramid of
                        Khufu, and as to the discovery of steel surgical implements and arrow heads
                        - this could only be with Ptolemaic or Roman remains. The paintings in the
                        tombs at Beni Hassan, B.C. 2800, show Egyptian butchers using not , as the
                        writer says, steel knives, but flint, the process of making which is shown
                        in other paintings, and the whetting stones are pieces of blue chert, used
                        to smooth the edges, many of which are foundin the neigbourhood of the
                        tombs, thrown away when useless Th eonly iron known to the Egyptians in
                        ancient times was the meteroic iron, as its name, "the metal of heaven,"
                        shows. That the Egyptian workmen used only bronse chiseis is shown by the
                        large numbers of them found on working sites, especially in such places as
                        the workmen's town at Kahun. In Egypt we have, therefore proof of a stone
                        age, into which in the later Neolitic period copper tools were introduced
                        first, followed soon after by harder bronze implements, and it was not until
                        the last days of the Egyptian civilisation that iron was introduced, and
                        then only very scantily.</p>
                    <p>From Babylonia the evidenc is more clear and convincing of the bronze and
                        copper ages. It is remarkable that, although the recent exploration in
                        Chaldes, escpeially those of M. de Suzze at Tello and Dr. Hilprecht at
                        Nippur, have carried the records of Babylonian civilisation back to at least
                        B.C. 4500, there is no proof of a ston eage. This is due to the fact that
                        the civilisation of the colonists in Shinar was developed on the cast of the
                        Tigris, where M. de Morgan has found at Susa a series of stratified remains
                        of the paleolithic, neolithic, and bronze age. The Sumerians brough with
                        them the knowledge of working both silver and copper, as well as the making
                        a bronze. In the inscription of Manishtusen in the Louvre dating from about
                        B.C. 4500 we find a silver tariff, but also copper and bronze objects
                        mentioned, and by names clearly distinguishing them, and there is no mention
                        of iron. Copper, bronze, silver, and lead are mentioned as material used by
                        Gudea in the construction of his temple, but there is no record of iron.
                        Meteoric iron, the sign forwhich means also "thunder" "lightning," and
                        "iron" is mentioned in the hymns, but the mention of iron first occurs in
                        the comemrical tablets of the dynasty of Babylon anbout B.C. 2200 and it is
                        not until later still that iron swords are mentioned. The evidence of
                        archology from the two eldest centres of civilidation is, therefore, quite
                        contrary to the learned doctor's conclusion "that there is no country and no
                        race no earth on which an age of bronze has intervened between the ages of
                        ston and iron."</p>

                    <p>We trust that Lord Minto will make it clear to the deputation how entirely
                        the British Government has the intersts of its Mohamedan subjects at heart,
                        and how strongly determined it is to hold the balance evenly between the
                        various section of the Indian population and not to allow an unfair
                        dominance to any one race or creed. The dangerous and disingenuous policy
                        adopted by the Sultan of Turkey in his realtions with Egypt has made it
                        necessary for us to take a firm stand against a Sovereign whom Mohamedans
                        thorughout the world regard with reverence on religious grounds. But this
                        opposition to the Sultan on the part of the British Government does not
                        involve, and was never meant to involve, the slightest hostility to Islam in
                        any part of the world. It is therefore of the first importance to make it
                        clear that not only are we not hostile as a nation to the Mohamedan creed,
                        but that, on the contratry, we, as the geratest of Mohamedan Powers, hold it
                        a duty to respect the rights of Islam, and to confirm those rights whenever
                        they are legtimately exercised.</p>
                    <p>Happily, Britain can point to an absolutely clean record in regard to her
                        treatment of Mohamedans not only in India, but in Egypt and in every other
                        part of the world where Englishmen have come in contact with Islam. We have
                        never interfered with the Mohamedan religion or oppressed its votaries. The
                        Indian Mohamedans are, we belive, the throughouly loyal to our rule and
                        appreciate our good faith. We would ask them, however, to rember that all
                        Mohamedans do not display the high qualities shown by thmeselves, and to
                        note that when we have been in conflict with the Sultan it has never been on
                        religious grounds. Though in the future, as in the past, we shall not shrink
                        from maintaining our rights to the fullest extend and in the firmest manner
                        against Turkey, the Turkish Sovereign will never be opossed by us as
                        Mohamedan, but, if at all, solely as a ruler who has unwisely chosen to
                        declar himself the active enemy of the British people. The faith of Islam
                        will never suffer from contract with our Empire. (Spectator)</p>
                    <p>The Nature Desire of Knowledge.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting and satisfactory to find that the Moeslem asked urgently
                        for a university. Lord Minto reminded them that they have already the
                        admirable college at Alighar. But this, after all is a small provision for a
                        population of sixty-two millions. We have done much less in India for
                        education, as even so partial a critic as Professor Vambery admits than the
                        Russians in Central Asia, despire the fact that our occupatio is older by a
                        century and the population we rule so much more intellectual than that of
                        Turkestain. ("Tribune.")</p>
                    <p>Germany and the Entente Cordiale.</p>
                    <p>What Germany says to England and France is in plain lanage: "I consdier the
                        friendship between you two a danger to myself in particular, and therefore
                        to the peace of Europe in general. Your assurances to the contrary mean
                        nothing to me who am the best, inded, the role, judge of my own judge of my
                        own inetersts. Therefore I will not brook your close association. You must
                        dissolve your union or else admit me to your frienship on equal terms.
                        Unless you follow one course or the other. I shall feel obligated to try a
                        third, and you will be morally responsible for it: I mean war. A mighty
                        struggle between us such as took place first between Prussia and Austria and
                        afterwards between Prussia and Austria and afterwards between Germany and
                        France for the upper hand seemed inevitable a few months ago. And it was so
                        conditionally not absolutely. You can yet ward off the conflict. But only in
                        that one way. Choose!"</p>

                    <p>The Grand Lama's Motor.</p>
                    <p>There was a time not long ago when the GRand Lama of Thibet was "wrapped" in
                        impenetrable mystery, but the wheels of Time move swiftly in this age of
                        motors, and it is therefore amhsing rather than starling to read in the
                        "Daily Telegraph" this morning that the Grand Lama is going in for an 8
                        h.p.car. It is to be pailged the sacred colour, yellow, and a very graphic
                        description is given by the orespondent of how it will reach his Holiness,
                        scaring on the way flying herds of Bamt Kyan, or tortoiseshell wild, and
                        flocks of she drakes and car headed geese. We feel sorry for the
                        tortoiseshell wild asses and the ducks and geese, but they cannot stop the
                        onward sweep of the car of civilisation. They must submit to being run over
                        or they must get out of the way. The Grand Lama will have a small lama as a
                        chaufeur, and we hope the ffect may be to improve the roads around
                        Lhasa.</p>

                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</byline>
                    <p>Yesterday Major Geneal the Hon.Sir. F.W. Stopford, commanding the London
                        District, inspected the 3rd Battalion Coldsteam Guards, at Wellington
                        Earracks, prior to its leaving for Egypt on the 29th inst. A large number of
                        spectators was present. There were 29 officers and 700 men on parage,
                        Colonal Granville R.F. Smith being in command, with Lieutenant Colonel
                        J.A.G. Richardson Hay second in command. Genearl Sir Frederick Stephenson,
                        the honoary chief of the regement, who is in his 90th year, was also
                        present. General Stopford minutely examined the battalion, which looked
                        exceedingly well in khaki and white helmets. According to the arrangments
                        the Coldstreams will embark at Southemption on the S.S. Silcilia, along with
                        a number of dragts for Alexandria, where the linear is due on the 11th
                        OCtober. The battalion will then proceed to Cairo, where it will be
                        quartered in Abbassieh Barracks. The 3rd Coldstreams are a fine shooting
                        battalion. In 1903, whilst at Aldershot, they won the Field Firing Cup at
                        the London District Rifle Meeting, the Guards Brigade Field Firing Cup, and
                        the Regimental Shooting Cup, and in the present year they wont the "Daily
                        Telegraph Cup," Roberts' Challenge Cup, which is open to the army, and the
                        Cheylemore Cup, which is also open to the army.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel P.A Kenns, V.C., D.S.O, who is so well kown in Egypt,
                        where he served with the 21st Lancers, has just been promoted to the command
                        of that very smart regiment. He was senior squasron officer at the time of
                        his promotion. It may be recalled that he won the cross for valour in the
                        wild charge of the 21st at Omdorman, by rescuing Captain Crole Wyndham from
                        certain death, and assistaing in the attempt to recover the body of
                        Lieutenant Grenfell. His many friends in Egypt will greatly pleased to hear
                        of his promotion, which followed sheer professional merit.</p>
                    <p>Captain F.J.M. Postlehwaite, The King's Own Light Infantry; and Lieutenant
                        W.F. Stirling , D.S.O., Royal Dublin fusiliers, have been seconded formally
                        in their respective regiments for service with the Egyptian Army.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant S.B.B. Dyer, D.S.O., 2nd Life Guards, who was recently in command
                        of No. 4 Squadron of the Egyptian Cavalry whilst serving with the Khedive's
                        troops, has just been prmoted captain in the Life Guards.</p>
                    <p>The battleship Hibernia, which commenced her gun and torpedo trials off
                        Plymouth <cb n="5"/>yesterday and carried them out sucessefully, is ordered
                        to be ready by 1st Janurary next, to relive the Victorious as flaghsip of
                        the Altantic fleet. The Hibernia's first comission will, therefore, be a
                        higly important once. The change will take ffect at Devonport, whereit is
                        understood the Victorious will arrive from Gilbraltar shorly before
                        Christmas to pay off. The flag of Rear-Admiral G. Le Clerc Egerton, who
                        recently took up his appointment as second in command of the Atlantic Fleet,
                        will then be shifted to the Hibernia. The change will add to the homogenity
                        of this fleet, which will then consist of seven battleships, of the King
                        Edward VII. class, the exception being the Magnificent. The sixth ship of
                        this group to join the Atlantic Fleet will be the Britannis, which is to
                        replace the Majestic early next month.</p>
                    <p>Lord Brassey's tempearte, yet weighty, criticism of Admiralty naval policy
                        has engaged considerable attention here. What Lord Brassay says in effect is
                        that the Dreadnoughts are untried and that ther are perils to the greatest
                        ships, as the Russo-Japanese war demonstrated, which no foresight or
                        provision can dispel. The Dresnoughts are as liable to the blown up by mines
                        as smaller battleships, and to be tropedoed as well, so that though the
                        Dreadnought's fighting capacity may be all powerful yet were she and those
                        of her class unfortunate in naval warfare the consequences would be
                        disastrous. Morever, he points out that the fewer battleships we have
                        diminishes the number of highly trained officers on the long list of
                        captains who would have, under the old conditions, as opportunity of showing
                        in the line of battle that they possess the Nelson touch. It is felt that
                        there is a good deal in Lord Brassey's statements.</p>
                    <p>The "Daily Mail" says German esponage seems to be usually active just now. It
                        is known that it exists in a notable degree at Portsmouth, and espceially
                        since the Freadnought was built. The Admiralty are, for instance, perfectly
                        well aware that at least six persons in that town alone are in the German
                        secret service, but of course action is difficult. It is the same thing with
                        other seasports, only in a less degree. Writing from Elenheim, New Zealand
                        (South Island), a correspondent remarks: "Are the ruling powers of England
                        quite blind to the aims and objects of Germany. They even have spies out
                        here quietly working up proper maps and information of harbours, ready to
                        land when they want to attack us. I am satisfied that England's day as
                        Englan is past; but as part of the British Empire, under a proper Imperial
                        Federation, it is only just beginning. We ree far more of the game here than
                        you would think possible, and the remarks made by German Visitors, and such
                        like, all point to the fact they think it a matter of only a few years
                        before Australiasia will be German."</p>
