                    <head>ABYSSINIAN RAILWAY,</head>
                    <p>During the last few months little has bap pened to remove the doubts and
                        anxieties which surround the relations between the Abyssinian Government and
                        the Ethiopian Railway Company. Yet the occasional items of intelligence
                        which from time to time are made public emphasise in the strongest manner
                        the importance of arriving at an early settlement. The deadlook which for
                        nearly four years has paralysed the railway arises from causes which are, or
                        ought to be, sufficiently well known. The 1902 Convention between the French
                        Govern-</p>
                    <p>ment and the Railway Company still remains the stumbling-block. The Emperor
                        Menelik steadily refuses to recognise an agreement which, in his opinion,
                        transforms the commercial undertaking contemplated in his original
                        concession of 1894 into a scheme for secaring the political predominance of
                        France within his own territories. Such an arrangement he denounces as being
                        neither more nor less than an invasion of his rights as an independent
                        African Sovereign. On the whole, it is not to be denied that in so saying
                        the Emperor has taken up a perfectly intelligible position. The practical
                        outcome of his attitude has been the almost entire suspension of the
                        company's operations. Pending the substitution of some more acceptable arrar
                        gement the Emperor has not merely refused to sanction the construction of
                        the second section of the railway from Dire Dous to the Abyssinian capital,
                        Adis Abeba, but he has also declined to allow the levying of the 10 per
                        cent. duty upon merchandise which, under the terms of the original
                        concession, was to provide the company with funds during the unproductive
                        period of the undertaking. The serious inconvenience arising out of the
                        present deadlock is clearly evidenced in the interesting account of a recent
                        meeting of the shareholders. Owing to the Emperor's refusal to permit the
                        imposition of the 10 per cent. duty the company is in the unfortunate
                        situation of having to face a loss on the year's working. Nor does there
                        appear to be any prospect of a change in this deplorable state of affairs
                        until diplomatists succeed in arriving at some compromise which may be
                        acceptable at once to the Emperor Menelik and the Governments of the
                        European Powers immediately concerned. It thus appears that the problem
                        which calls urgently for solution is of a twofold nature. In the first place
                        the arrangement, whatever form it may take, must be so devised as to
                        reconcile the interests of England, France, and Italy. Thanks to the
                        harmonious spirit which at present governs the relations of the British and
                        French Governments, it is hardly probable that any serious obstacle will
                        hinder the adjustment of the claims of the parties to the entente cordiale.
                        England is not likely to demand more than equality of opportunity in matters
                        of trade and a gusrantee that the British capital embarked in the railway
                        will be reasonably safeguarded. If England and France come to an
                        understanding on these points, there is no reason to suppose that Italy will
                        be unwilling to follow suit. But whatever be the form of the agree ment
                        arrived at by the Baropean Powers, the sine qua non must be the consent of
                        the Emperor Menelik. His present position is one of profound suspicion
                        towards any proposal calculated to further the political designs of a
                        foreign country within Abyssinian boundaries. It therefore remains to be
                        seen whether France will consent to modify her views so as to remove from
                        the Emperor's mind the misgivings which have operated so unhappily for the
                        success of the railway company's undertaking. In an apparently inspired
                        article which appeared in the "Matin" of Jane 25, it was suggested that
                        French requirements would be met by an unconditional undertaking to the
                        effect that at no time would it be permissible for a second railway to be
                        constructed which would come into competition with the present
                        concessionaire company. This demand, if indeed it has been seriously made,
                        seems to be amply satisfied by the clause in the original concession of
                        1894, by which the Emperor Menelik explicitly agrees to allow no second
                        railway to be brought into Abyssinian territory either from the Indian Ocean
                        or the Red Sea. The upshot of the situation points, therefore, to the
                        imperative necessity of losing no time in arriving at a final settlement.
                        There is every reason to suppose that the Emperor Menelik is seriously
                        annoyed by the delay. He has gone so far as to announce that unless the
                        efforts of diplomacy succeed in circumventing the present "impasse" he
                        himself will undertake the completion of the line. Indeed, he has at his own
                        expense constructed the preliminary works for some thirty kilometres from
                        Adia Abeba. The question at once arises, From what source is he likely to
                        obtain the necessary funds In regard to this matter it is significant that
                        while the Governments of the three Powers immediately concerned are still
                        unable to put an end to the deadlock, Germany has already made great strides
                        towards securing a footing at the Abyssinian Court. Without entering into
                        the designs which underlie this movement, it is at least worth pointing out
                        that it would be a sorry conclusion to the labours of the last ten years if
                        the motive power behind the Abyssinian railway were eventually to be located
                        in Berlin. ("Morning Post,")</p>

                    <p>A COURT OF ENQUIRY-</p>
                    <p>The Mounted Infantry Company concerned in the Denishwai affair arrived at
                        Alexandria to day.</p>
                    <p>We understand that a court of enquiry will be held almost immediately at
                        Mustaphs barracks with closed doors. Although nothing is stated officially
                        as to the object of the en- quiry, we believe that it refers to the Bersina
                        incident. Meantime, we advise our readers to receive the statements of Al
                        Moayad" with something more than a grain of salt.</p>
                    <p>We understand that in consequence of his having neglected to furnish the
                        British offi- cers who went pigeon shooting at Denishwai on the 13th ult.
                        with the customary facilities, the omdeh of that village has been dis-
                        missed from his post, and that the wekil el omdeh has been sentenced to
                        three months' imprisosment, in addition to dismissal. Mourad Effendi
                        Moharrem, molahez of police at the Shohada outpost, has been dismissed from
                        the service.</p>
                    <p>"Al Lewa" states that certain effendis have drawn up in English a documeat of
                        40 pages giving the fallest details of the Denishwai outrage and its result,
                        which they intend to submit to the British Parliament and the English Press,
                        so that they may learn the "truth of the affair" not only from the English
                        official reports but also from a trustworthy na- tive source. We know these
                        "trustworthy" sour- ces, having received at various times petitions,
                        complaints, and the like from correspondents who complained of various and
                        grievous wrong Our opinion of the "trustworthiness" of native sources has
                        been modified by the fact that of about seven complaints which we have
                        received five proved on exsmination to be absolutely false and two
                        shamefully exaggerated.</p>
                    <p>A native contemporary states that the Go- vernment has organised a force of
                        ghsffirs drawn from Cairo which it intends to forward to Denishwai for the
                        protection of public se- carity. Each of these gh ffi's has been furnish- ed
                        with a plate, which he wears on his breast with the words "Ghaffir at
                        Denishwai" engraved thereon.</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM.</head>
                    <p>Although weekly reports as to the progress of the cotton-worm are not being
                        issued this summer by the Ministry of the Interior, it must not be concluded
                        that the worm is less prevalent. The same work of hand-picking is being
                        carried on in the affected districts, of which we understand that the
                        provinces of Menoufieh and Behera are the worst, and great saccess is being
                        met with. The work, too, is greatly facilitated by the amenability of the
                        villagers, who appear to have appreciated the splendid effects of last
                        season's labours and, therefore, willingly, carry out the instructions of
                        the special inspectors who are charged with the supervision of the work.</p>

                    <p>Now that new direct steamship lines are being established between Turkey and
                        Egypt, the question of coaling easily, especially for vessels calling in the
                        Black Ses, as with the Roumanian Line for instance, is of moment. All who
                        have dealings with the Levant are familiar with the excellent quality and,
                        what is more, cheap price of Tarkish coal. The coal field is situated on the
                        Asia Minor shore of the Black Sea, and extends thence inland. The chiet
                        coaling atation on this coast is Zonguldagh, one hundred and sixty miles
                        from the Bosphorus, and most of the mines situated in the valley are worked
                        by the Société Deraclée, a French institution.</p>
                    <p>The semi-artificial harbour affords ample shelter from the northerly seas to
                        as many as six ocean-going tramps; but there are other stations which can be
                        used in fair weather.</p>
                    <p>The Heraclea coal-basiu affords ample scope for British investors, who could
                        easily, in view of the financial necessities of the Turkish Government, buy
                        up a whole valley for £12,000. The coal is of second-rate Newcastle
                        quality.</p>

                        Company's net profit during 1905 was £45,523, as com- pared with £31,324 in
                        1904, and a dividend of 5 per cent. is declared on the paid-up capital; as a
                        bonus of 1 per cent. is, to be paid, the final dividend will be 6 per cent.
                        The length of this line now in working order is 125 miles and the paid up
                        share capital amounts to £300,000. A saving of £147,842 was made in laying
                        down the first section of the line from Kopia to Bulgarla. Since the line
                        was opened, on October 25, 1904, the goods traffic amounted to 27,668 tons
                        by the end of 1905.</p>

                    <p>THE KHEDIVE'S ROLE.</p>
                    <p>In his series of leading articles appearing in "Al Zaher" and referring, from
                        a Nationalist point of view, to the present situation, Abou Shadi Bey
                        continues his critique as follows:-</p>
                    <p>H.H. the Khedive was in his prime when he began to reign, a circumstance
                        which has always produced the greatest effect upon the sympathies of the
                        young. The nation accept ed his Highness's promising rule in the hope of
                        gaining part at least of its desire. It hoped to see the Occupation withdraw
                        from Egypt and a date for that withdrawal fixed. His Highness received the
                        national aspirations with sympathy; but as far as can be judged, was
                        over-hasty in his policy. Those who were friendly to the youthful Khedive
                        were given their congé when they showed differences of opinion in regard to
                        the policy most suitable to the needs of Egypt, and were replaced by men who
                        had little political experience. The Emir then began to oppose England while
                        she was, as she is at present, practising a vigorous and able policy, while
                        we produced words without deeds. He began to make his policy manifest and
                        England countered. The Minis- try was dismissed by his order, but it was
                        soon restored to its position. The army was criticised and the Khedive had
                        to make excuses for his errors. Had his Highness accapted the advice of the
                        wisest heads among his people the nation would have preserved its diguity;
                        but he did the reverse, continuing his policy unsupported by politic and
                        experienced advisers. The differ- ence which arose between his Highness and
                        the late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was, it is believed, due to the advice of the
                        latter. Nevertheless, had his Highness continued his career in accordance
                        with his ambitions we should have arrived at certain results, but the role
                        of stubborn opposition appears to have been played out and to have been
                        replaced by a new part quite the reverse of the original. The public has
                        observed that the Khedive, daring the past few years, has paid little atten-
                        tion to the nation's affairs, but has taken great interest in his own; and
                        those natives of Egypt, who find themselves in any trouble or diffi culty,
                        have been obliged to lay their grievances before the English alone. The
                        Damietta ques- tion is an example of this fact. The new policy which his
                        Highness has adopted puts the country under the absolute control of England,
                        which has given every facility for his Highness to enjoy a perfect
                        rest-core. Meantime they have caught Egypt by the throat and are prac-
                        tically its absolute rulers. But we should like to know where we are being
                        led.</p>

                    <p>The "Morning Post's" Rome correspondent says considerable alarm has been
                        caused at Brindisi by the report that the Indian mail is to be removed from
                        that port to Constanzs in Rumania, whence it would be embarked direct for
                        the East. If such be the case, it will be large- ly the fault of the Italian
                        railway authorities who have never yet put down a double line of rails
                        between Bologna and Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Another Rome telegram states that in di- plomatic circles it is understood
                        that Signor Tittoni, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is ne- gotiating as a
                        corollary to the Abyssinian settlement, a commercial agreement which will
                        prevent Eastern trade from deviating from the Mediterranean to the Black
                        Sea, and so neatralise German Rumanian efforts which would prove detrimental
                        to the interests of the Simplon Tunnel and the Mediterranean coun- tries. In
                        the meantime Great Britain has assured Italy that the Indian mail will
                        retain the Brindisi route.</p>

                        been compiled showing the propor tion of India's monthly export of wheat (in

                    <p>Total exports for orders. Percentage of wheat to Egypt "for orders" as
                        compared with total exports of wheat to Egypt. From these figures it is very
                        plain that practically all the wheat sent to Egypt is mere- ly transit
                        wheat, which goes on to other countries of destination. The percentage of
                        the wheat sent to Egypt from India, as com pared with the total export of
                        wheat to all countries, has been fairly constant. In 1902-3 it was 22.7 per
                        cent., in 1903-4 it was 30.3 per cent, and 28.4 per cent. in 1904-5, whilst
                        in the ten months of 1905-06 it was 22 2 per cent.</p>

                        <p>Reports to hand show that, taking the Island as a whole, and except for
                            the hailstorm men- tioned below, little corn has been damaged by the
                            rains, which fell late in the season. On the other hand, mech benefit
                            resulted from them to carob and olive trees. The yield of carobs is
                            expected to be very large. Complaints, however, are very general in
                            regard to the destruction caused to those trees by rata. It is a long
                            standing trouble, and a practical care does not yet seem to have been
                            found. Some trials have lately been made by the Commissioner of Limassol
                            which, as an experiment only, seem to have met with some success. The
                            treatment consists in suffocating the rats in the hollows of the trees
                            by means of sulphur fames. Sulphur is placed on hot charcoal in the
                            bottom cavity of the tree trunk and the fames find their way through all
                            the hollow parts of the tree, some- times emerging at points quite high
                            up among the branches. Many rate have thus been killed and great hopes
                            are entertained by villagers that by this simple expedient a means may
                            be found whereby to rid themselves of this 1 destructive little animal.
                            It is largely, of course, a question of expense, and it depends upon the
                            cost of the process when applied to a large number of trees whether or
                            no the process can be regarded as a practical solution of the diffi-
                            culty.</p>

                        <p>There has recently been a considerable im- portation of agricultural
                            implements, and machinery into the Iland. The greater part has been for
                            the account of a local development company, but a healthy increase of
                            such im- ports is also recorded in the case of private individuals.
                            There is now quite a number of driving engines for various purposes, and
                            the law passed in last session of the Legislative Council prohibiting
                            the use of native wood as fuel for such engines will be found very valu-
                            able as a protection againt the ruthless employ ment of our forest

                            glad that Papho, with its extensive seaboard, is now to have a small
                            port where larger vessels can receive cargo. It should be of
                            considerable benefit to local trade, which has hitherto been much

                        <p>The Cyprus Government Railway has lately issued in a handy booklet form
                            the regulations which are in force regarding passenger and goods
                            traffic. It is satisfactory to learn that the facilities afforded by the
                            railway are more and more being availed of by the peasant class, who are
                            gradually overcoming their prejudices against this novel mode of

                        then began to hit, receiving useful support from Cheesman, and the next

                        <p>LONDON, July 3. HOUSE OF LORDS.-In the debate on Turkish affairs,
                            yesterday evening, Lord Fitzmaurice stated that the construction of the
                            Bagdad Railway was not necessarily a British interest, but it raised
                            many interesting questions which were receiving careful
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>Lord Lansdowne said that there was no reason, if proper guarantees were
                            secured, why Great Britain should adopt an obstructive attitude, or
                            should insist upon a fresh settle ment. Lord Ripon said that the present
                            condi- tions were considerably more advantageous than the original ones.
                            He also pointed ont that if Great Britain's proposal was not accept- ed,
                            she would have a free hand and be prepared to make other proposals.</p>

                    <p>SOME SECRET HISTORY.</p>
                    <p>Uganda, Nigeria, Egypt, the Sudan, South Africa-their internal and their
                        imperial his tory-these form the subject rt the volume" which Colonel F. I.
                        Maxse, C.B., DS.O., has " issued under the modest title of "Seymour
                        Vandeleur: the Story of a British Officer." There are several chapters
                        giving the his- tory of Egypt and the Sudan-England on the Nile," "The
                        Egyptian Army at Work," "On the Athara," Omdurman," "Another year in the
                        Sudin."</p>
                    <p>From Colonel Maxse's very lively introduc- tion to the second of these
                        Egyptian chapters, we may quote a characteristic passage:</p>
                    <p>"Whenever military errors are committed the general public is usually led to
                        believe that the fault lies with the 'stupid officer' on the spot. Yet there
                        have been occasions in which the officer on the spot has saved, the civilian
                        in the Cabinet from the conse quences of his ignorance, as the Egyptian Army
                        was now to prove.</p>
                    <p>"In March 1896, a Cabinet Council was summoned at short notice to deliberate
                        upon an unexpected 'event. The Prime Minister, addressing his colleagues in
                        a room at the Foreign Office, announced that a grave situation had arisen in
                        one of the new colonies of the Kingdom of Italy. There was, unfortunately,
                        truth in the public telegrams describing an Italian defeat in Abyssinia and
                        England would willingly extend to Italy a helping hand in the north- corner
                        of Africa, where this regrettable occurrence took place. At Cairo we had a
                        small British garrison, but Cairo being a considerable distance from Adows,
                        it would be difficult for this garrison to render effect- ive assistance.
                        Under these circumstances, could any means be devised of helping Italy,
                        without icearring undue risk our- selves?</p>
                    <p>"At this point several Ministers, shifted aneasily in their chairs, putting
                        on their spectacles and removing them nervously. One of the younger members
                        begged that a map imight be brought to assist them in their deliberations,
                        and a messenger departed to fetch it. He returned with an atlas printed in
                        1882, that being the latest edition avsil- able. After some diffialty Cairo
                        was found on one page and Abyssinis on another, but the intervening regions
                        were nowhere shown. However, on looking at the small general map of Africa,
                        some one remarked that Cairo did not after all appear very far distant from
                        Abyssinis, and those who had bean uneasy were reassured!</p>
                    <p>"Meanwhile, a Cabinet Minister who had lately travelled up the Nile to Wady
                        Halfs sent to his office for a bigger, modern map. On arrival it covered the
                        table in the middle of the room, though it only represented the Nile valley
                        from Cairo to Khartoum. At the mention of Khartoum, there was an awkward
                        pause and one or two murmura of apprehension so the Prime Minister quickly
                        pointed out that there was no intention of undertaking the reco: quest of
                        the Sudan, bot... that the Egyptian Army had a force at Wady Halfa and that
                        it might be possible for this forca to advance a little distance south.</p>
                    <p>The beads now bent over the map to discover where the Egyptian Army had a
                        post, and the Minister who had seen it explained to his colleagues how
                        efficient the garrison was. Moreover, the name Wady Halfa was printed in
                        large block letters which gave it a solid lock. Southwards, the names
                        Akasha, Firket, Koseh (in small type), looked comparatively insignificant,
                        and as if a small force could easily occupy one of them, so each was
                        suggestei in turn. But the Minister who had been up the Nile and knew what
                        he was talking about put his finger on the big block letters-Dongola -and
                        suggestel that, if any advance at all were advisable, the cocupation of
                        Dorgola might have some influence on the Khalifa, whereas to occupy a emall
                        mud village whose inhabitants the Dervishes had already exterminated, could
                        have no effect.</p>
                    <p>"However, the Cabinet dispersed without coming to any decision, beyond a
                        request to the Commander-in-chief to write a minute on the feasibility of an
                        advance-not an expedition-to an unnamed spot south of Wady Halta. A few of
                        England's councillors left the room with a vague recollection of some
                        unfamiliar African names which had been referred to on the map, and one aged
                        politician in particular was so bewildered that when, in the street, a
                        reporter of his acquaintance hurriedly asked him what the meeting had been
                        concerned with, he could remember nothing but the word 'Dongola," which he
                        murmured unconsciously.</p>
                    <p>That afternoon the Commander-in-Chief sat at his desk, composing a minute
                        which he knew would be fatile, when suddenly his ear caught sound of the
                        word 'Dongola' -shouted by newsboys down in the street. By spending a
                        halfpenny he learned that the subject of his minute had been settled without
                        him, and that he might spare himself farther effort that day.</p>
                    <p>"In the evening to all parts of the British Empire the various press
                        associations tele- graphed the welooma report that the long- delayed Nile
                        expedition was to start, and that Dongols would be its objective-aor was
                        this the first time a hesitating Government has had its hand forced by a

                    <head>A VALUABLE EGYPTIAN PLOUGH.</head>
                    <p>The following letter, dated Cairo, May 16th, appears in "Landwirtech-ftliche
                        Maschinen and Geräthe," which merits attention from the commercial point of
                        view:-The large local landowner and multi-millionaire, H. E. Boghos Pasha
                        Nubar, has constructed an automobile steam-plough, which was tested lately
                        by the committee of the Khedivial Agricultural 8- ciety, and declared by it
                        to be particularly suitable for Egyptian agriculture. The appara tas
                        consists of a road locomotive, of 40 hp, which draws a plough which leaves
                        behind it a ploughed belt 3.30 metres about 12 f- broad. The plough has
                        rectangular shares and carved b'ades. The shears cat and wind by means of
                        their rotary motion through the ground, and effect a breaking-up which re-
                        sembles the work of a steam plough after a second application, or an
                        animal-drawn plough after the third application. The tests were made over a
                        field 300 metras long, that had remained untouched for several months, and
                        was quite dry and fast. The plough worked in one hour 6,739 metres of
                        ground. It went 20 centimetres into the ground, and used 100 kilogrammes of
                        coal por 0.4 hectare of ploughed land. As the plough has been shown to be
                        good for dry land, the millionaire's invention will be very useful for the
                        cultivation of cotton in Egypt. The committes tested also the value of the
                        plough for working in the manure, and it was found that the manure was
                        perfectly well mixed with the earth. Other particulars are added, bat, apart
                        from the merits of the machine, which seem obvious, it would have been
                        interesting to have learned where a machine of such efficiency was
                        manufactured, though it would appear to have been in Egypt</p>
                    <p>THE HIGH PRICE OF EGYPTIAN YARNS.</p>
                    <p>In his commercial review in the "Financier" Mr. William Tattersall remarks
                        that spinners in Bolton of the saperior qualities of Egyptian yarns have
                        held pretty firmly to quotations, with only a small retail business taking
                        place. Users at the moment are not receiving many cloth orders, and there
                        seam little disposition to anticipate requirements. In South Lanos- shire,
                        where the commoner kinds are produced, quotations are rather irregular,
                        order lists in some cas 38 not being very extensiva. The high pries of
                        Egyptian cotton is decidedly against spinners in this section. The outlook
                        for the future is somewhat uncertain.</p>

                    <p>The "Saving Remnant" In America.</p>
                    <p>Americans may dismiss the idea, if they ever entertained it, that the people
                        of this country regard them all as in the same boat with the beef trust, the
                        Standard Oil Com- pany, the dishonest railway managers, and the people who
                        control "yellow dog" funde. There are Pharisees and foolish individuals in
                        ali countries. We have some among us, and as they are generally very ready
                        to talk they probably do some mischief. But the mass of the people
                        understand very well that the mass of the American people are very like
                        them- selves; and that in America as here, and elsewhere, society is held
                        together by the "saving remnant," the quiet inarticulate people who believe
                        in probity and honour, and who try to do their duty and to fulfil their
                        obliga- tions honestly. (Times.")</p>
                    <p>The Discovery of Shakespeare.</p>
                    <p>We have heard it said-indeed, it was a common remark at one time-that it was
                        our German cousins who first discovered Shakes- peare for ourselves. The
                        dictum is palpably absurd. We need only point to such names as Coleridge and
                        Lamb and Hazlitt to disprove the idea that our dramatist required any
                        foreign interpretation to give us a true idea of his merits. Indeed, if we
                        may venture to say so, it might be better for the youthtul literary student
                        to ignore some of the German commentaries which abound in our schools and
                        universitier, and study Shakespeare in the light in which he appeals to the
                        English intellect, and in the treatment which he has receive from English
                        critics. ("Telegraph.") Parliamentary Editing.</p>
                    <p>The method of editing questions in the House of Commons has already provoked
                        a storm of indignation, and members are in- clined to assert their rights in
                        respect to interrogating Ministers with no uncertain voice. It is a fact
                        much commented upon that complaints as to interference with parlia mentary

                    <head>PALESTINE EXPLORATION.</head>
                    <p>On June 22, 1865, the Palestine Explora tion Fund was founded, and it is,
                        therefore, the doyen of our various exploration societies. It owes its
                        conception chiefly to the energy of the late Sir George Grove and Dean
                        Stanley; and even with their enthusiasm, they could not have imagined the
                        excellent work the fund would be able to accomplish in the last forty years.
                        To many the work of exploration in Palestine seemed a waste of energy, for
                        little could be left in a land which had been so thoroughly swept with the
                        "besom of destruc tion." The fallacy of this idea has been amply proved; and
                        the results have, especially those of recent yeare, caused even skilled
                        arobe logists to be amazed. A still greater impedi- ment to success bad to
                        be encountered- namely, the opposition of the Sultan to excavation,
                        especially at Jerusalem, but this, in turn, has been overcome, and
                        explorations are now conducted on the oldest sites in the land, not only by
                        the English Fund but also by German and Austrian explorers. The work bas
                        been long and tedious, but it has been from the first in skilled hands both
                        as regards to topographical survey and archeological exploration. It was
                        felt from the first forms- tion of the tund that the first work to be
                        undertaken was a careful survey, and the collection of place names to form a
                        basis for the reconstruction of the Palestine of the Hebrews. With this work
                        the names of Lord Kitchener, Sir Charles Wilson, Sir Charles Warren, and
                        Colonel Conder will always be associated. Next in importance was the study
                        of the topography of Jerusalem, and by the long campaign of underground work
                        a vast amount of material has been obtained upon which to base the
                        reconstruction of the topo- graphy of the Holy City at various periods in
                        its history. Spade work, in Palestine especially, upon ancient Canaanite and
                        Hebrew sites, was long delayed, but, in 1889 a great stimulus was given to
                        this branch of research by the discovery in Egypt of the famous Tel el
                        Amarna letters. These wonderful docu- ments, the diplomatic dispatches of
                        the Egyptian rulers, and the kings and princes of Palestine and Phoenicis,
                        opened the eyes of Orientalists to the fact that the pre Israelite
                        inhabitants of Palestine were not a race of barbarians, but a people who had
                        drank freely of the learning and culture of their Babylonian masters. It was
                        at once seen that if letters passed from Syria in 1450 Bc. to Egypt, some
                        such medium of intercourse must have existed in the land itself and that
                        Palestinian records of the days prior to Joshua were possible to be
                        discovered.</p>
                    <p>The first attempt was made at Tel Hesy, the site of the Philistine city of
                        Lachish, by Professor Petrie, and continued by Dr. Bliss, and the result was
                        the proof of the above theory, for a cuneiform inscribed tablet of the same
                        class as those found in Egypt, and actually fitting into the correspondence,
                        was found, and since that large finds have been made at Taanach, Gezer and
                        Megiddo. These first explorations prove how rich a field for archaeologists
                        the grave mounds of Palestine are. Systematic exploration shows city after
                        city, phase of culture and civilisation super- infased one above the other
                        in regular strata from the neolithic age to the days of Islam. The work at
                        Lachish was exceeded in im- portance by that of Dr. Macalister at Gezer, a
                        Canaanite royal city, the site of which still bears the name of Tel Tezer.
                        Here traces of all periods of Palestinian civilisation, from the Maccabean
                        age- the castle of Simon Maccal as having been discovered-back to the
                        neolithic age-that of a race of cave- dwellers, unacquainted with metal, but
                        who burned their dead-have been discovered. Following this come many relics
                        of the Ca- naanites who used bronze and made pot tery. The greatest find,
                        however, is that of a well-preserved Canaanite High place with its lines of
                        upright bethel stones, which throws &amp; flood of light on the idolatry
                        which surrounded the Ierae ites, and to whose temp- tations they were eo
                        prone to yield. Ample proof, by the discovery of the bones of new- born
                        infants in the shrine, was afforded that the offering of children to Moloch,
                        mentioned in the Bible, was a Cansɛnite custom. Also of great importance was
                        the discovery of a large number of cave dwellings. The net result may be
                        summed up in a few words. Where little was expected forty years ago, the un-
                        dreamed of has been accomplished: Palestine now takes her place in the
                        community of national civilisations of the ancient East. Her monuments and
                        records fit in with those of Ba- bylonia, Assyria, and Egypt; her story is
                        part of their story, and still has an individuality of its own. Oce
                        important result of these dis- coveries must not be passed unnoticed.
                        Distinct evidence has been found that the Palestine maritime cities were in
                        tonch with the Cretan and Mycer man civilisations, and that probably the
                        Philistines were from that island; at Lachish, Gzer, and other sites Myce an
                        pottery and gems have been found In a word, the whole of the work of the
                        Fand has been a triumph of the spade. But what has been done is but an index
                        of what is yet to be done, and it is to be hoped that all lovers of
                        arcbreology, all readers of their Bibles, will help the work. For many years
                        Sir Walter Besant was the secretary and literary editor, and much of the
                        success of the work was dae to him; and now Mr. Armstrong, himself a
                        Palestinian explorer, is its secretary. (Mr. W. St. Chad Boscawen, in the

                    <p>To the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                    <p>Sir,-We beg to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of the reply which you
                        have caused to be sent to our letter of the 16th inst., and to say that we
                        shall, of course, comply with your raquest that we should treat the informa-
                        tion contained in it as for the present confi- dential.</p>
                    <p>We would respectfully submit that in this reply the point raised in our
                        letter does not appear to be explicitly answered, but that the terms which
                        his Majesty's Government seem now to be insisting upon appear to us to
                        diffet in the following important respects from those which Lord Lansdowne,
                        in a memorandum communicated to his Excellency the Turki h Ambassador on
                        October 28 last, stated to be, in the opinion of his Majesty's Government,
                        "indispensable before they could assent even in principle to this
                        proposal."</p>
                    <p>1. They concern only the yield of the increased duties, whereas Lord
                        Lansdowne stipulated that "some competent authority must be entrusted eh the
                        collection and con- trol not only of these fands, but of the local revenues
                        which they are intended to supple- ment," i.e., the whole of the revenues of
                        the vilayets.</p>
                    <p>2. It is now stipulated that the sum in ques tion will be expended under the
                        "guidance" of the International Commission, whereas admi- nistrative
                        collection and control was originally an indispensable condition; and these
                        are functions which are tenaciously withheld by the Porte from the Financial
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>We are also deeply concerned to learn that whereas his Majesty's Government
                        has hitherto stated its own conditions directly to the Porte, taking the
                        view that its consent, which is absolutely necessary before a change so
                        seriously effecting it can become operative, should only be given in return
                        for such substantial reforma as Great Britain desires to see introduced, the
                        present intention of his Majesty's Government appears to be to minimise
                        their demand to that acceptable to other Powers less affected by the
                        proposed increase, and to conduct the negotiations by joint notes of the
                        Ambassadors at Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>We venture to express the hope that his Majesty's Government may revert to
                        the previous attitude and the previons conditions, believing that thereby
                        they will more faith- fully interpret the wishes of the people of this
                        country, who are now, as always, emphatically in favour of a Radical
                        transformation in the methods of administration in Macedonia. We would not
                        persist in pressing this matter upon your attention were it not that,
                        unfortunately, we find no room for doubt that up to the present time no
                        European reforms, neither the Gendarmerie scheme nor the financial scheme,
                        have made any real change in the situation. The country is a scene of
                        constant bloodshed, and the gravest evils have not even been checked. Unless
                        the pace of European reform is accelerated a general insurrection is inevit-
                        able, and in such an event the increasing difficulty of confining the strife
                        within the limits of the Turkish frontier must be obvious. That this should
                        be the climax of a series of European schemes of reform would be an
                        anmeasured catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>We have learnt from a recent speech in the House of Commons that his
                        Majesty's Govern- ment do not think it possib'e to expect the Powers to join
                        in collective action of a strenu- ons kind until they have had at least a
                        year's experience of the working of the Financial Commission. While we fear
                        lest the Great Powers may ultimately find that in such a period of prolong
                        inaction they have passed the limits of human endurance, we would strongly
                        urge that his Majesty's Government should mark their disapproval of the
                        insde- quate functions entrusted to the International Commission by
                        withholding during such period consent to the increase of dues. We have the
                        honour to be, your obedient servants, J. WESTLAKE, President, NOEL BUXTON,

                    <p>I am to state, in reply, that the several considerations to which you allude
                        have re ceived the careful and continual attention of his Majesty's
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the negotiations with the Otto- man Government in regard to the
                        question of Macedonian reforms it has been essential, both in the opinion of
                        Lord Lansdowne and Sir E. Grey, to maintain unimpaired the concert of the
                        Powers, since disagreement among the Governments concerned would necessarily
                        ren der illusory all prospects of ultimate improve ment in the three
                        vilayets.</p>
                    <p>Before coercive measures had actually been undertaken against the Ottoman
                        Government, towards the close of last year, various condi- tions had,
                        indeed, been indicated as calculated</p>
                    <p>to promote financial reform; but eventually it was imposible to retain all
                        the features of the scheme as originally outlined, and, in order to aphold
                        the unanimity of the Powers and to secure the adoption of that portion of
                        the financial reglement which was really essential, his Majesty's Ambassador
                        was authorized, on December 7, to accept certain modifications of the
                        scheme, upon which his colleagues were unanimou-ly agree.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances, Sir E. Grey agrees that Lord Lansdowne could not
                        have entrusted his Majesty's Ambassador to place himself in opposition to
                        the other Powers on the occasion without endangering the whole cause of
                        Macedonian reform, and Sir N. O'Conor has subsequently been able to report
                        that, in his opinion, the reglement was not materially weakened by the
                        concessions in question.</p>
                    <p>When an understanding had been arrived at as to the supervision of the local
                        financial administration, it became indispensable, in the very interests of
                        reform, to guard against the continuance of budgetary deficits by enabling
                        the Ottoman Government to supplement the revenues of Macedonia from Imperial
                        funds. To this end, and in view of the additional expenditure, involved in
                        the reorganization of the "Gendarmerie," the Powers were induced to consent,
                        under certain conditions, to the increase of the Turkish Customs duties.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty's Government have fortunately ucceeded in securing an agreement
                        among the Powers as to the mode of collection, under an effective guarantee,
                        of the proposed surtax, and likewise as to the allocation of the reve nues
                        which will be available.</p>
                    <p>Sir R. Grey considers, therefore, that the assent of his Majesty's Government
                        to the increased duties has been made conditional upon the maximum of
                        concessions it is possible at present to obtain, and that further resistance
                        on this question would impede and embar- tass, rather than effectively
                        promote, the progress of reform.</p>
                    <p>I am to add that, while they cannot admit that the reforms hitherto
                        introduced have effected no change in the situation, his Ma jesty's
                        Government are none the less carefully watching, in the light of reports
                        which are continually received from the International Commission, the state
                        and requirements of the three vilayets, and they will not fail, in concert
                        with the other Powers, to urge upon the Ottoman Government such measures of
                        reform as are necessary to establish real and substantial improvement in the
                        condition of Macedonia.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty's Government do not, however, consider themselves precluded, in
                        the event of the schemes now in force proving inadequate, from making or
                        supporting at any future time alternative proposals with the same
                        object.</p>
                    <p>I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant, B. GORST.</p>

                    <p>PROBABLY every case of consumption begins with a cold. </p>
                    <p>Consumption is generally classed as a hereditary disease, but consumption is
                        not hereditary. </p>
                    <p>A constitutional weakness is inherited which renders one liable to
                        consumption. </p>
                    <p>Even people who have strong lungs may acquire consumption from a cold. </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Addie Harding, 121 W, Brighton Ave., Syracuse, N. Y., writes: </p>
                    <p>"I have been a user of Peruna for the last twelve years and can truthfully
                        say that there is no better medicine on earth. </p>
                    <p>"A SURE PREVENTATIVE." </p>
                    <p>"With me it is a sure preventative for colds and many other ills. In my home
                        can always be found a bottle of Peruna. Two or three times a year I am
                        troubled with my throat. </p>
                    <p>"I always had to have the services of my physician two or three times in each
                        case. </p>
                    <p>"Although a user of Peruna, I never thought of taking it for my throat until
                        about two years ago.</p>
                    <p>"I tried Peruna to check it, and to my great delight I was not troubled with
                        the smothered and choked feeling and never have since. </p>
                    <p>"I can check it every time with Peruna. </p>
                    <p>"I certainly would not be without Peruna one minute." </p>

                        writes: </p>
                    <p>"I have been annoyed with a cough for years. </p>
                    <p>"Often it was so bad that I could not sleep half the night. Many people
                        thought I had consumption.</p>
                    <p>CONSUMPTION WAS FEARED.</p>
                    <p>"A woman recommended Peruna to me two years ago. I began to take Peruna and
                        now I am perfectly free from a cough, </p>
                    <p>"I am glad to say that Peruna cured me entirely, I take Peruna occasionally
                        when I do not feel well and I also give it to my children. </p>
                    <p>"Peruna is the best medicine for coughs and colds. I have told many people
                        how much Peruna has helped me.” </p>
                    <p>A neglected cold is a well-worn path to consumption. </p>
                    <p>Many a person catches cold and pays no attention to it. </p>
                    <p>He scarcely recovers from the first cold when he takes the second.</p>
                    <p>Still he gives it no heed, and possibly takes another cold, and so on. </p>
                    <p>He doses himself with bromides, quinine and various expectorants. </p>
                    <p>His case is catarrh, at this stage, and his case should be treated as
                        catarrh. </p>
                    <p>A common cold is acute catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Finally, if the cold is allowed to continue, it becomes chronic catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Mrs, Frances Wilson, 82 Nelson street, Clinton, Mass., writes: </p>
                    <p>"Had you seen me at the time of my illness and now, you would not wonder that
                        1 take delight in sounding the praises of Peruna. </p>
                    <p>"My ailment was a severe cold which attacked the bronchial tubes and lungs. </p>
                    <p>"I followed your special directions and after using six bottles of Peruna I
                        was on my feet again.</p>
                    <p>"I think Peruna a wonderful medicine." </p>
                    <p>All colds, coughs, bronchitis, laryngtis and tonsilitis should be treated as
                        catarrh, as they are in reality catarrh. </p>
                    <p>The success of Peruna in relieving these cases entirely depends upon the fact
                        that Peruna is a catarrh remedy. </p>
                    <p>It relieves catarrh wherever located in the system. Whether in the throat,
                        bronchial tubes or lungs. </p>
                    <p>CONSUMPTION PREVENTED.</p>
                    <p>It has saved a multitude of peo-ple from consumption by eradicating catarrh
                        before it reaches the lungs. </p>
                    <p>The tendency of catarrh of the throat or head is to spread downward to the
                        lungs. </p>
                    <p>If taken in time, Peruna will prevent these cases. </p>
                    <p>We have in our files many testimonials from people who thought they were
                        victims of consumption, but have been permanently relieved by the faithful
                        use of Peruna. thus showing that catarrh was really the cause of their

                    <p>Le Caire, Mardi 3 Juillet 1906. Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres vient
                        d'être réduit de 1/8 à 31/8 pour bent.</p>
                    <p>Hier, an Stock Exchange, le Consolidé an- glais &amp; dotaré en reprise de

                    <p>Comme nous l'avions fait pressentir dans notre Circulaire d'hier, la tendance
                        à la faibless s'est accentuée sur notre marché des valeurs par suite des
                        circonstances que nous avons xposéer. Les cours de Londres et de Paris nt,
                        d'ailleurs, contribué à rendre la séance de ce matin plus lourde qu'on ne le
                        prévoyait, et il y aà enregistrer des moins- values notables, principalement
                        sur les valeurs dirigeanter. C'est là, répétons-le, un tassement transitoire
                        naturel, dont il n'y a pas liea de se préoccuper ontre mesure.</p>

                        intéressantes ci- après</p>
                    <p>"Ce qu'on appelle le marasme de notre Bour- se ne lui est pas particulier. Il
                        se fait sentir à celle de Londres, et il est complet à Berlin, où il est
                        accompagné d'an petit resserrement d'ar- gent sur le marché libre. A Vienne,
                        les affaires sont également rares, et elles le sont aussi à Bruxelles. La
                        Bourse de Madrid est encore moins active que la nôtre, et l'on se repose à
                        Rome comme à Paris. Bref, nous sommes en plein dans la période où les
                        marchés jouissent d'un repos bien gagné et où les revues finan- cières sont
                        à court. Le réveil et la reprise d'ao- tivité sont pour Septembre et
                        Octobre. Nous avons done trois mois devant nous, pendant lesquels nous
                        n'aurons sans doute à constater que de petits mouvements et à commenter de
                        petites nouvelles, à moins que la Douma russe trouble cette quiétude et
                        fournisse aux chroni ques une matière plas abondante que celle qu'elles
                        offrent aujourd'hui."</p>

                    <p>SPECULATIVE BUILDER IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>DESERT SUBURBS,</p>
                    <p>(BY A TELEGRAPH" CORRESPONDENT.) In my previous article I dwelt upon the
                        wholesale transformation of Cairo, To show how this transformation has
                        brought about the present land boom is now my object. Fabulous is the only
                        term I can apply to the sudden rise of prices given for building land in
                        Cairo. I cannot use the word fluctuation in regard to these inflated prices,
                        for up to to-day the rise has been almost continuous. Let me cite a few
                        instances to show the magnitude of the boom. out of the scores upon scores
                        which have come within my personal knowledge. Four years ago the Kasr e Ali
                        Palace, adjacent to the British Agency, and running down to the banks of the
                        Nile, was sold for £80,000. Happily for the owners, the sale could not be
                        carried into effect, owing to the right of pre-emption being exer- cised by
                        neighbour. Shortly before I left Cairo the price offered for the palace and
                        gardens was half a million, and within the last few weeks it has been
                        finally sold for £700,000.</p>
                    <p>I know, too, of a small property which was bought some years ago for £2,000,
                        which was sold towards the end of last year for £8,000. Within the course of
                        a very few months it was re-sold by the purchaser for £16,000, again re-
                        sold for £24,0:0, and, finally, in so far as I know, parted with for
                        £32,000. Up to a few years ago pound for a square mètre was con- sidered a
                        fair price for land in the most fashion- able quarters of Cairo. Only a few
                        weeks ago some land in a comparatively unfashionable situation was bought by
                        friends of mire, con- trary, I own, to my advice, for £19 per square mètre,
                        and within a day or two, they were offered £4. I might cite instance after
                        instar cs of similar purobases being made, which have, one and all, resulted
                        in large profits.</p>
                    <p>If I am saked my own individual opinion, I should say that speculations of
                        this kind must inevitably result in a sma-h. Shares which go up, so to
                        speak, in a balloon, are, according to my experience, certain to come down
                        as a para- chute. But I am bound to add that this opinion is not shared by
                        local experts, who are får more competent than I am to form a correct
                        judgment. They contend that the constant influx of Greek would-be
                        bouseholders into Cairo and its vicinity is certain to continue for a
                        considerable time; that the area of land available for building purposes
                        cannot well be largely extended; and that, therefore, the present prices of
                        such land must advance. materially before the supply exceeds the de mand. I
                        have reason to believe that a ring has been formed by some of the wealthiest
                        capitalists in Egypt, including a number of very influential magnates,
                        politically as well as financially, and exceptionally acquainted with the
                        land market, in order to buy any property in Cairo that comes up for sale,
                        and the fact ha these financiers are backing their conviction with their own
                        money is not one to be lightly disregarded.</p>
                    <p>1 am much impressed, too, by the knowledge that men of great experience and
                        high autho- rity are variously contemplating the construc- tion of outlying
                        suburbs, in order to counteract the over low into Cairo proper. Various
                        schemes are afloat for building towns at Tourah, on the Helouan railway,
                        along the road to the Pyra- mids, which are now connected with Cairo by an
                        electric tramway; and even on the slopes of the Mokattem hills, which are,
                        according to the programme, to be reached by a fanioular railway. The only
                        one, however, of these schemes which has actually taken form and shape is
                        the Oasis Company, of which the well-known Belgian capitalist, M. Empain,
                        the concessionnaire of the Cairo tramways, is the chief promoter. This
                        company, which includes amongst its directors many of the leading
                        notabilities in Egypt, has secured from the Bgyptia Government, at a very
                        moderate price, the concession of some six to seven thousand acres of land
                        in the desert, about eight miles distant from Cairo in the direction of
                        Suez. The company are about to build an electric ailway from the new
                        township to the capital, which will carry passengers to and fro in about ten
                        minutes. They propose to cater mainly for the minor officials and for the
                        seo- tion of the public which is unable or unwilling to pay tile enormous
                        renta demanded for house- room in Cairo. Very reasonable terms are offered
                        to applicants, by which they can obtain leases on payment of a moderate
                        interest, secured on the premises of which they are to have inmediate
                        occupation. The ossis is situated some 100 to 200 feet above the level of
                        the Nile, where the air is exceptionally dry and healthy Owing to the recent
                        discovery of subte traneous rivers in the Suez desert-a discovery which, if
                        it ex'ends to other parts of the Nile Valley, may modify the whole system of
                        Egyptian irrigation-the Oasis Company consider they are in a position to
                        provide a con- stant and copious supply of fresh water. I have no interest
                        in the company. I do rot hold, I regret to say, a single share, as the £1
                        share sold at £6 on allotment. I only single out this company because its
                        board is composed of men who justly command high authority in Egypt, and the
                        fact that such a board should stake their reputation on the possibility of
                        creating a Cairene suburb in the desert, and that the application for shares
                        should have been unprecedentedly large, shows how widespread the belief is
                        in Bgypt that the present enorm- ons rentals demanded and obtained in Cairo
                        are likely to prove permanent. On any other hypothesis the anxiety of the
                        Egyptian public to invest money in the oasis suburban town- ship would be
                        absolutely unintelligible, as the</p>
                    <p>enterprise, even if ultimately successful, cannot be expected to yield any
                        large profit for many years to come.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the fatore may have in store, there is no possit ility of disputing
                        the contention that so far the boom in Cairo town lots has enriched Egypt
                        for the time being Apart from the Alexandrian and Cairene capitalists, there
                        are any number of small people, who a year ago had no capital to speak of,
                        and who now have realised fortunes varying from £10,000 to £50,000. This
                        sudden diffusion of wealth has given an immense impetus to speculation, and
                        up to the period when I left Egypt-that is in the beginning of May, when
                        business is practically suspended owing to the departure for Europe of all
                        the classes who can afford to quit the country during the summer heate
                        scarcely a day passed without some new indus- trial company being brought
                        out, and in most cases with success. Capital was asked for hotels,
                        irrigation works, electric lighting, tram- ways, steamboats, land
                        reclamation, and, indeed, for every and any scheme by which money seemed
                        likely to be made. Lord Cromer's warn- ings in his annual reports about the
                        dangers of over speculation were well meant, but so far they have fallen on
                        deaf ears. and I am inclined to think that the men who have speculated
                        beyond their means have so far had good reason not to regret their lack of
                        caution.</p>
                    <p>One curions festare of the situation is that, though the well-to-do natives
                        have made money by selling their lands, they have taken little or no part in
                        the companies which have succeeded one another in rapid rotation. My own
                        belief is that the number of native born Egyptians who own shares in any
                        Egyptian company form an insignificant proportion. Nine tenths of the
                        original allottees are, as a rule, residents in Egypt who, even if they were
                        born there, and are therefore subjects of the Khedivial Government, are
                        not-in the ordi- nary sense of the word-natives. By race and creed religion
                        they are Greeks, Armeniane, Jews, Syrians, and so on, who are best describ-
                        ed by the general term Levantines. This is also the case with the banks,
                        financial instita- tions, and mortgage companies. Even this category of
                        Levantine shareholders does not, as a body, take shares in Egyptian
                        companies as an investment, bat for speculative purposes. Their intention is
                        to place their shares in Europe at an advance above the price for which they
                        have purchased, and in the great majority of instances their intention has
                        been carried out with success. It is very difficult to speak with absolate
                        certainty on such a matter, especially in Egypt, where all shares are issued
                        to bearer, and where no register of the names and addresses of the
                        shareholders is forthcoming. The general impression, however, amongst
                        well-informed persons is that, in the event of a financial crisis occurring
                        in Egypt, the ultimate loss would fall as a role on European shareholders.
                        If this impression is well founded, it follows that a crisis which, with or
                        without reason, depreciated, the value of the numerous companies doing
                        business in Egypt, would not materially affect the native population.</p>
                    <p>A corroboration of this view is to be found in the fact that the great
                        Sucréries col'apse, which for the last twelve months has excited intense
                        interest in Alexandria and Paris, has attracted comparatively little notice
                        amidst the general public. The catline of the case may be told very briefly.
                        In the days of Ismail Pasha's grandeur his Highness conceived the des of
                        introducing the production of sugar into Egypt: This idea, once adopted in
                        his fertile brain, in common, for that matter, with many others which have
                        largely contributed in the end to the present prosperity of Egypt, was
                        carried out with extraordinary energy, and with a lavish disregard of
                        expenditure. He built factories on the banks of the Nile, stocked them with
                        all the most perfect machinery to be found at that time in Earop, gollected
                        a number of experts conversant with the trade of extracting sugar from cane,
                        constructed and equipped a most elaborate network of railways in order to
                        convey the canes to the mills, and as antocrat employed his supreme
                        authority to compel all tenants on his private estates which bore the name
                        of the Daira Sanieh to grow cane as a condition of their tenure, and to
                        supply the same exclusively to the factories. Before, however, the sugar
                        factories got into full swing Ismail Pasha's financial difficulties stopped
                        the development of the sugar manu- facture, just as they hindered the
                        prosecution of the Sudan Railway.</p>
                    <p>In 1877 Ismail Pasha, under the pressure of the Commission cf Inquiry, agreed
                        to assign his own private estates, and those of his child- ren, to provide
                        for the liquidation of the floating debt, which then amounted to £8,000,000.
                        By so doing he saved Egypt from bankruptcy. In 1878, after the deposition of
                        Ismail Pasba, the Commission of Liquidation, appointed under his successor,
                        Tewfik, and presided over by my old friend, Sir Rivers Wilson, who had been
                        previously noting president of the Com- mission of Inquiry, agreed to place
                        the Daira Sanich estates, including the sugar factories, Pin the hands of an
                        International Commision, in which French it finence was supreme. The new
                        Administration did not prove a succes, and after the accession of the
                        present Khedive the sugar factories were leased to a syndicate formed by
                        Raphael Suares, the wealthiest and most influential of Levantine capitalists
                        resi- dent in Egypt. It may fairly be assumed that the enterprise did not
                        turn out highly re- munerative, as within a few years the sugar factories
                        were re-sold in Paris to a French com- pany, presided over by M. Cronier,
                        the re presentative of the great French sugar making firm of Henri Say and
                        Co., and known himself as the "Sugar King," on account of his sup- posed
                        control of the sogar market. Up to last year the Daira Sanieh sugar
                        factories, which had hitherto proved a white elephant to all their various
                        administrators, began to pay large dividends under Cronier's
                        administration.</p>

                    <head>THE STRAINS ON MASONRY DAMS.</head>
                    <p>A USEFUL INVENTION.</p>
                    <p>An interesting feature of the recent soirée of the Royal Society was the
                        demonstration given by Professor Karl Pearson and his assistant, Mr.
                        Pollard, of an invention by which the strain placed upon masonry dams can be
                        successfully mapped out. In the case of the Assonan dam, and similar large
                        stroo- tarer, it is found that the pressure of water involves every section
                        in a state of strain, and it has been a very serious difficulty with
                        builders to accurately ascertain the points where the strain is most severe.
                        Professor Pearson and his assistants have discovered what would appear to be
                        an ingenious method by which the difficulty should be considerably reduced
                        if not altogether removed.</p>
                    <p>To demonstrate the capabilities of this method they constructed a small model
                        of a dam about twelve inobes in height, in jelly. This jelly, when the water
                        is poured into a tank-Arepresenting the upper part of the river becomes
                        deformed. Needles are thrust into the jelly at regular intervals, and the
                        rising of the water in the tank causes the relative position of the needles
                        to alter, it being pos sible to follow their movements by a clever optical
                        contrivance. Thus the strains all over the cross-section of the model can be
                        mapped</p>
                    <p>out.</p>
                    <p>One objection brought against this method is that the great difference in the
                        substances of masonry and jelly render the results of an experiment in the
                        case of a masonry dam doubtful, it being common knowledge that, while jelly
                        can be wrenched out of shape in a very considerable degrae without being
                        broken, a similar piece of masonry would be destroyed before the alteration
                        in its shape would be sufficiently large to be noticeable. The answer to
                        this is that both substances are subject to the law which demonstrates that
                        within certain limits the elastic deformation of a given substance is
                        proportionate to the force applied to it. Hence the value of the model.</p>
                    <p>We understand no shorthand notes were taken of Professor Pearson's
                        instructive des- cription of his method, but our London repre- sentative
                        submitted to him the above report, which he was kind enough to say was
                        substantially correct.</p>

                    <p>EGYPTIAN COTTON SEED IN INDIA.</p>
                    <p>The recent sale in Manchester at a good price of the consignment of cotton
                        grown experimentally in Sind from Egyptian seed has clearly demonstrated
                        (the "Westminster Gazette" says) the suitability of the soil and climate,
                        aided by the irrigation canals, of at any rate one district of India for the
                        growth of the higher grades of cotton. Properly to estimate the far-reaching
                        effects of the success, now assured, of the experiments that have been going
                        on for two years and a half under the direction of Mr. Fletcher, the Deputy.
                        Director of Agriculture to the Bombay Govern- ment, it must be borne in mind
                        how unsatis factory for the trade has been its dependence on the United
                        States: and that Egypt, the other established source of supply of the class,
                        of raw material required by English mana- facturers, has, in the opinion of
                        experts, reached the limit of production. The result or this year's sowings
                        over a much larger area, which, with the experience gained, were made in
                        February and Marob, four months earlier than usual, will be watched with the
                        deepest interest.</p>

                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
