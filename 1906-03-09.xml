                    <head>GERMANY AND PEACE.</head>
                    <p>Germany ought by rights to be a great bulwark of peace. The Constitution with
                        which she was left in 1815 was not a good one, for it left her divided up
                        into so many principalities and powers that no one now except a few
                        professors of history can remember their names. Bat after an abortive
                        revolution and three wars Germany obtained her unity, and stretches now from
                        the Alps to the North Sea and tbr Baltic, from the Moselle to the Memel. The
                        German Empire has a larger population than any European State except Russia.
                        The people have for thirty-five years been constantly increasing in
                        prosperity. They have plenty of good schools and universities. They are not
                        so completely absorbed in industrialism and urban life as to be without
                        great stretches of country each as might be envied them by smaller States
                        suffering from too much rush to the towns. German trade spreads all over the
                        earth. Her shipping is prosperous beyond the wildest dreams of the fathers
                        of the present generation of Germans. Such a people in such conditions might
                        be expected to be happy and contented. Yet, says a writer in the "Morning
                        Post," if those persons whose business it is to observe and report on what
                        German public men and German writers for the Pres are thinking and saying
                        are to be trusted the inference must be drawn that the Germans are neither
                        happy nor contented, but are living in a state of terrible uneasiness.
                        Bismarck, who used to be their spokesman, once said in their name: "We
                        Germans fear nothing but God." Some more recent utterances almost suggest
                        that to make the saying true today the word nothing would have to be changed
                        to everything. Bismarck's last great achievement in the lifetime of the
                        Emperor William I. was to secure the passing of a Bill for rearranging the
                        periods of liability to military service by which the strength of the Army
                        for a war was increased by three-quarters of a million men. He explained
                        that the idea was to be able to fight at the same time on the eastern and
                        the western Frontier, to put down a million men on each of these fronts, and
                        have a third million in reserve. With such forces Germany might be easy.
                        Since the last war in Manchuria the risk, it it ever existed, of a war on
                        two fronts cannot be said to exist. The German Army is enongh to form a sure
                        defense against any attack that can reasonably be anticipated, and it is as
                        certain as anything in this world can be that no Power contemplates an
                        attack on Germany. Yet in these conditions, which might seem to approximate
                        to those of the millennium, the Germans seem to have become nervous.</p>
                    <p>It is, for example, reported from Berlin that Prince Bulow recently gave a
                        confidential lecture to leading members of the Reichstag to explain to them
                        why a Bill should be passed making provisional tariff arrangements with the
                        United States. He and his hearers were believers in retaliation. They would
                        like to have raised their duties against American imports. This, Prince
                        Bulow explained, would be their best economic policy and would be morally
                        sound. But Germany wanted American support, or at least her benevolent
                        neutrality in the "world-theatre." The banking of the United States would be
                        needed by Germany whenever England and France made a joint assault on her.
                        It was to get President Roosevelt and America on his side in the game he was
                        playing in tha "world-theatre" that the Emperor sent Prince Henry to the
                        United States, that he sent friendly messages to the President, and that he
                        arranged for an exchange of professors between German and American
                        Universities. Germany was expecting a time when she would want help to
                        attack the British Empire at its periphery. Then it would be useful to have
                        ten thousand German troops in German South-West Africa to march on Capetown,
                        while the American Army could invade Canada. So far Prince Bulow's
                        confidential speech, an interesting speech, a speech which very likely the
                        Imperial Chancellor will say has not been accurately reported. Someone has
                        let the cat out of the bag, which was indiscreet no doubt; but, then, the
                        German people must be kept in touch with the thoughts of the statesmen who
                        control their destinies. Prince Bulow is evidently thinking the same
                        thoughts as Dr. Otto Stern and Seestern and Major von Bruchhausen and the
                        rest of the panic mongers and war promoters. It will, perhaps, be declared
                        to be a calumny, this unauthorised report. If it is an invention it is, at
                        any rate, a German invention. Its object is not peace and goodwill, but to
                        spread the hatred of England, which Prince Bulow has done so much to foster.
                        The frame of mind which keeps thinking of armies and navies and wars appears
                        to pervadeall Germany from the cottage to the throne. The Emperor himself on
                        Sunday, receiving a congratulatory address on his silver wedding, said: "My
                        first and last thought is for my fighting forces by land and sea," and
                        added: "May God grant that war may not come. Should it come, however, I am
                        firmly convinced that the army will acquit itself as it did thirty-five
                        years ago." War cannot come to Germany unless Germany and the Emperor want
                        it, for no foreign Power has the slightest idea or intention of attacking
                        Germany.</p>
                    <p>Side by side with these echoes in high places of the talk of possible wars
                        that floods the German Press at present come some interesting comments from
                        Vienna. The "Neue Freis Presse," receiving its inspiration from Berlin,
                        talks of an improvement in Anglo-German relations and a change in the
                        character of English policy. This is the attempt to carry out through the
                        medium of Vienna Major von Bruchhausen's suggestion that England must be
                        lulled to sleep, and friendship professed towards her until the German Fleet
                        is ready to cover a landing in England. But even this limited kindness as
                        accompanied with its dose of spiteful poison. The highest circles in
                        England, says the same article, have the intention of driving France into a
                        war against Germany, and the inspired writer goes on to say that if there is
                        a war it will be of England's making. For whose consumption is this rubbish
                        circulated? Not for that of the French ; they know better. Hardly for that
                        of the Hungarians. Perhaps it is for the benefit of the German-speaking
                        Austrians and for reproduction in the newspapers of Germany. It seems absurd
                        to suppose that any educated German believes the fables that are connected
                        for him abont England. But though it ought to be absurd the fact is that
                        many of them do believe a great many stories about our country which have no
                        foundation in fact. It is a pity, but what are Englishmen to do? There is
                        nothing to be done except not to follow the German example and not to
                        believe stories about Germany except upon German evidence. The facts about
                        Germany are those that we have recited at the beginning of this article, and
                        that her people until the end of the last century were friendly and amiable
                        so that it was a pleasure for Englishmen to travel among them. But since
                        then they have for the most part come to believe about England all sorts of
                        things which no Englishman can with equanimity hear them say, and they are
                        quite sure that they are better informed than the Englishman about his own
                        country, its feelings, its policy, and the intentions of its Government.
                        Meantime, the war-fever in high places in Germany is not without its
                        dangers, and to add a few millions to the British Navy Estimates would have
                        been a wise measure of precaution.</p>

                    <p>An exciting scene was witnessed in the London Stock Exchange's Miscellaneous
                        Mining Market last Thursday afternoon, when 200 North Egyptian Land shares
                        were bought in. The Official Broker commenced by bidding 1 1/4 for the
                        shares but gradually increased his bid to 4 5/16, when at this price the
                        shares were at last supplied. The incident will serve as a useful reminder
                        of the danger of being caught short of shares in a market which is more or
                        less nominal. Some said that the business rather reminded them of the
                        Anglo-Dutch affair, which has not yet been forgotten.</p>

                    <p>The "Globe" of Thursday last in its City article remarks : The ten per cent,
                        dividend declared by the Egyptian Investment and Agency Company (Limited) is
                        a hopeful sign. This concern appears to have embarked on a prosperous
                        career, and those who prefer for the purposes of speculative investment a
                        share which is not entirely dependent upon the fortunes of mining might do
                        worse than give Egyptian Investments and New Egyptians attention. The New
                        Egyptian is a company doing serious work under a very sound international
                        control. Fresh reconstruction proposals have been formulated in the case of
                        the Nile Valley Company. These provide that dissentient shareholders will
                        have the right to be paid off as a valuation. The reconstruction scheme we
                        have already recommended as desirable, and the inclusion of this provision
                        makes it more satisfactory than ever. We may state on official authority
                        that the rumour as to a pending reconstruction in the case of "Mummies"
                        (Egyptian Mines Exploration Company) is entirely without foundation. Some of
                        the smaller shares, such as Fatira and Eridia, are being picked up by those
                        who can afford to wait, against an anticipated improvement in Egyptians

                        Anglo-Belgian group, to whom allusion hss already been trade in our columns,
                        is now a fait accompli. The deal was effected last week through Messrs.

                        but with the infusion of new blood and capable administrative and executive
                        work it is a foregone conclusion that this company will enter on an era of
                        prosperity which it was utopian to expect under previous conditions.</p>
                    <p>The capital will probably be considerably increased with a view to extending

                        improvements.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter for public congratulation that a crying scandal should cease
                        and that the Fayoum Light Railway Company, which has been so harshly, if
                        justly, criticised in the past by the authorities as well as the public,
                        should now become an integral part of the vast machinery of works of utility

                    <head>THE LATE WILSON PACHA.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent sends to the "Times" the following particulars of the career
                        of Wilson Pacha, whose death occurred lest week : — The death of Mr. James
                        Wilson (Wilson Pacha) Assoc. M.In.C.E. M. In. M.E. which occurred at
                        Hampstead on February 24, deprives the ranks of Anglo Egyptians of one of
                        their oldest members. He was born in 1831, at Bridge of Weir, in
                        Renfrewshire; and, after serving his apprenticeship as engineer with the
                        famous ship-building firm of R. Napier and Son, of Govan, he joined the
                        Cunard Company. In the service of this company be spent some time in the
                        Crimea during the period of the war, at one or two engagements of which he
                        was present. Soon his duties called him to Egypt ; and, in the year 1858 he
                        entered the service of Ismail Pacha during the governorship of Mohamed Ali's
                        fourth son, Said Pacha. Thereafter Egypt claimed him, and throughout the
                        Khediviates of Ismail Pacha and Tewfik Pacha until 1901 (Abbas Pacha), when
                        he retired from active work, his abilities and energies were employed in its
                        service. For over 40 years he was associated, as engineer in chief, with the
                        Daira Sanieh, and to the improvement and development of that great sugar
                        growing and sugar-manufacturing enterprise he devoted the greater number of
                        the years of his career. In view of the important advances which have been
                        made latterly in the agricultural and industrial life of Egypt, it is
                        interesting to note that he was instrumental during the crisis brought about
                        by the cattle plague—in introducing steam ploughing into that country.
                        Wilson Pacha, furthermore, was one of the first, if not actually the first
                        (1880-81) to build an iron dahabeah—bending plates and frames by aid of
                        native labour on the banks of the Nile, which, apart from the interest
                        attaching to the conditional difficulties involved in its construction, was,
                        and we believe still is, the largest boat of its order ever launched open
                        its waters. From Ismail Pacha he received the firman of Bey in 1879 ; from
                        Tewfik Pacha the Star of Egypt in 1883 ; and, in the same year, he was
                        raised to the rank of Moutamais. The decoration of the third class or
                        Commander of the Imperial Order of the Medjidieh was conferred upon him in
                        1886 (permission to accept which he received from Queen Victoria), later the
                        Order of the Osmanieh ; and in May, 1895, he was promoted to the grade of
                        Mirmiran with the title of Pacha.</p>

                        BRITAIN.</head>
                    <p>The Constantinople correspondent of the "Times" remarks :––"Some irritation
                        is shown in Turkish official circles at the intervention of Great Britain in
                        what Turks affect to regard as an internal affair of the Ottoman Empire. In
                        spite of the changes which have taken place in the last 20 years,
                        Constantinople still clings to the view that Egypt is a Turkish province.
                        The British Government, of course, has no intention of permitting any one to
                        question its right to defend Egyptian interests from encroachment, whether
                        by the suzerain State or from any other quarter. The aggressive conduct of
                        the Turks is generally explained by a desire to strengthen their position at
                        Akaba, which it is thought they wish to make the terminus of a branch line
                        from Ma'an, connecting the Hedjaz railway and the Red Sea.</p>
                    <p>The Suzerain's Rights.</p>
                    <p>It will be no bad thing for diplomatic calm, says the "Globe," if the coming
                        delimitation of the frontier between the Ottoman Empire and Egypt results in
                        a dearer definition of Turkey's suzerain rights in the latter country. Among
                        Old Turks, it is still held that the British occupation and control of
                        Nileland do not produce any alteration in the ancient condition of affairs
                        prior to the successful revolt of Mohamed Ali. This fossil iufluence being
                        still strong at Yildiz Kiosk, the Sultan, swayed by it—partly, perhaps, by a
                        much more potent influence in the background—has sent troops to a part of
                        the debateable territory, apparently on the principle that possession is
                        nine-tenths of the law. It is believed that this bold attempt to solve the
                        boundary question has connection with a scheme for establishing railway
                        connection between Asia Minor and the Red Sea, via Akaba. Germany has, for
                        some time, taken a lively interest in that enterprise; some Berlin
                        Chauvinists have even urged the expediency of canalising the isthmus
                        separating the Gulf of Akaba from the Mediterranean, as a rival waterway to
                        the Suez Canal. But the route passes through territory claimed by Egypt, and
                        Great Britain, as her protector, will see to it that the Ottoman troops are
                        withdrawn before the Joint Delimitation Commission gets to work. As for
                        Turkish suzerainty, it is no more than a diplomatic make-believe ; if it
                        were really recognised, there would soon be an end of British dominance on
                        the Nile.</p>

                        SHAREHOLDERS.</head>
                    <p>The following circular has been issued to the shareholders of the Nile Valley
                        Company, Limited: I am instructed to inform you that it is necessary to make
                        a slight amendment in the scheme proposed for the reconstruction of this
                        company, and which was put before the shareholders on February 12th last,
                        owing to the action taken by a shareholder holding 20 shares to restrain the
                        company from carrying into affect that scheme. This decision is, of course,
                        binding unless and until reversed on appeal, but as the decision will
                        necessitate only slight alteration in the original scheme, and as time is of
                        the greatest importance, it is not deemed worth while to appeal. The
                        directors are sorry that you should be troubled with another meeting, but
                        the alteration in the scheme most be submitted to the shareholders, and I am
                        therefore instructed to enclose you a notice calling an extraordinary
                        general meeting for Monday, March 5th, at 12 o'clock. As the resolutions to
                        be proposed will require a three-fourths majority of those voting, I am
                        instructed to enclose you a stamped form of proxy, which, if you are unable
                        to be present, I shall be obliged if you will be good enough to sign and
                        return to the office of the company, on-or before Saturday, March 3rd. The
                        amended scheme which will be put before the shareholders is shortly as
                        follows:— (1) A new company to be called the Nile Valley (New) Company,
                        Limited, will be registered with a capital of £150,000, divided into 250,000
                        shares of £1 each ; (2) the liquidator of this company is to be authorised
                        to sell the undertaking and assets of this company to the new company ; (3)
                        part of the consideration for the solo is to be the allotment of 218,257
                        shares of £1 each in the new company, credited as 16s paid—that is to say,
                        with a liability of is a share —30 that each shareholder in the present
                        company will be entitled to subscribe for one new share credited as fully
                        paid for each share now held by him, and all shares not subscribed by
                        shareholders will be offered for sale by the liquidator. The liquidator will
                        also have a call at par for one year on the unissued shares, videlicet,
                        31,743 shares ; (4) as further part of the consideration for the sale, the
                        new company will pay any amount which may become payable to dissentient
                        shareholders, in excess of the amonnt realised by the liquidator on the sale
                        of the shares, which such dissentient might have claimed, and will discharge
                        all the liabilities of the old company including advances and interest
                        thereon, and will pay the reconstruction and liquidation exceases of the old
                        company. You will notice that the scheme, so far as it concerns shareholders
                        who take up the new shares, is practically unaltered, although it meets the
                        technical objection taken to the previous scheme.</p>

                    <head>KOCHANSKI'S CONCERT.</head>
                    <p>The fine concert-room of the Khedivial Hotel was thronged to overflowing last
                        night upon the occasion of the second concert given by M. Paul Kochanski.
                        Such a musical treat as this wonderful young violinist of only 21 accorded
                        his enthusiastic andience will, it may safely be conjectured, not be
                        forgotten for long by those who were so fortunate as to listen to the
                        exquisitely rendered performance of this, one might say, second Paganini.
                        The programme opened with the well known and beautiful Concerto of
                        Wieniawski in three movements. The first, Allegro Moderato, was perhaps the
                        least attractive, having a good deal of that gymnastic element in its
                        composition which, even in the hands of the best violinist, rarely affords
                        so much pleasure as the more seductive strains of sweeter melody. The
                        Romanza which followed may certainly claim to rank amongst the finest
                        compositions written for the violin ; last night it was heard to the best
                        advantage, and during this performance particularly M. Kochanski gave us a
                        fine exhibition of his masterful talent, bringing out with inborn pathos the
                        very essense and soul of his istrument. The final sprightly movement "Ala
                        Zingara" gave a must pleasing example of the lighter style of this
                        violinist's playing and was much appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the concert commenced with a strikingly quaint but
                        nevertheless interesting composition by Tartini, "Le Trille du Diable." This
                        dates from about 1770, and it may be of interest to relate that one night,
                        while Tartini was working at a composition, the muse of inspiration having
                        completely deserted him, he threw himself on his bad but to sleep fitfully.
                        Suddenly he saw seated at the foot of his bed the awe inspiring form of
                        Satan, who had taken his violin and was playing an air quite new to the
                        composer. This was the theme upon which Tartini subsequently composed his
                        "Le Trille du Diable," and it is considered one of the chef-d'oeuvres of
                        this master. "Le Trille de Diable" was followed by an Intermezzo (Dogaresse)
                        of N. Sinadino, with harmonium and piano accompaniment, the music of which
                        produced by the blending of the three instruments was particularly
                        effective. A Mazurka of Zarzycki completed the second part of the
                        programme.</p>
                    <p>Tha final three items could hardly have been better chosen. The Chopin
                        Wilhelmy Noctnurne, a Fileuse of Lotto, and last but not least, Paganini's
                        "Le Streghe," all gave proof of the fact that variety of style in no way
                        affected M. Kochanski's thorough mastery of his instrument. Two encores were
                        given, the first, Bach's "Aria," calling forth genuine applause, and the
                        finale, a most pathetic romanra "Con sordino," giving no less pleasure.</p>
                    <p>A criticism of the evening's performance would not be complete without
                        mentioning the fine accompanying of Miss N. Goldsmith, who in no small
                        measure contributed to the success of the concert, as well as M.
                        Marini-Simonetti, who presided at the harmonium. We most sincerely hops that
                        the rumour may be true that M. Kochanski may be induced to give us yet
                        another concert at the Zizinia Theatre with fall orchestra before leaving
                        Alexandria. In conclusion suffice it to say that after the grand performance
                        of last night, M. Kochanski may at any rate feel confident of being accorded
                        a very warm reception, if he does give us the pleasure of another
                        hearing.</p>

                    <p>POSITION AND PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY.</p>
                    <p>The fifth ordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Egypt and Sudan
                        Mining Syndicate, Limited, was held at No. 6, Queen Street Place, London
                        E.C., on February 27 last, the Rt. Hon. Lord Vaux of Harrowden (chairman of
                        the company) presiding,</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. W. F. Garland) having read the notice calling the
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : When I last had the honour of addressing you, some 12
                        months ago, it was my pleasant duty to ask you to consider as to the
                        declaration of a dividend, as the result of the sale to the Sudan Gold
                        Field, Limited, of the concession which we had been developing in the Sudan
                        for some three or four years previously. The consideration received for the
                        property so assigned enabled you to declare a dividend of 5s per share in
                        cash, equivalent to £ 3,125, in addition to which a distribution of Sudan
                        Gold Field fully-paid shares was made in the proportion of three of such
                        shares for every four syndicate shares. The cash and share distribution
                        together represented taking the shares at the par value of £1 each) a
                        dividend of 100 per cent, upon the nominal capital at that time. Naturally,
                        being an exploration company, and not a development company, we cannot
                        expect to be in a position to make large profits every year. Before we can
                        effect sales we have to prove that the property to be disposed of contains
                        auriferous reefs, not only of an encouraging nature, but of a character
                        which, so far as the indications and probabilites are concerned, leads us to
                        believe that they will eventually prove to be valuable, and place the
                        company acquiring the property in a profitable position. Although during the
                        past year we have not advanced any of our properties in the matter of
                        development to a point at which we should be justified in appealing to the
                        public for a large amonnt of working capital, to develop them, yet we have
                        accomplished a great deal of useful work towards the proving of their value,
                        and are very hopeful that in respect of our Negem mine we shall find it
                        practicable to deal with it in the near future. In Egypt we have continued
                        active operations at the two centres, Dungash and Barrshme, at each of which
                        we have had at times rich ore. The Dungash mine, notwithstanding that the
                        ore bodies met with so far have been short, is one which in our opinion
                        should be further developed, and at one point in particular—viz., the 200 ft
                        level east of the No. 3 shaft—we consider that there is a reasonable
                        probability of our intersecting a valuable run of ore. At Barrahme, also,
                        where we have most extensive old workings, and where during the past twelve
                        months we have had some of the richest ore we have yet met with either in
                        Egypt or the Sudan, there is every inducement to continue the exploration
                        both laterally and in depth. We have spoken in our report of the valuable
                        rock met with at the bottom of the old workings at the No. 1 shaft at a
                        depth of 192 ft from the surface. Some of the stones would give very high
                        assay results, but at the depth referred to this remarkably rich chute is
                        short, and we have now to open it up at deeper levels where we hope to find
                        it more extensive.</p>
                    <p>On our Berber concession the opening up of the reef at the Negem mine is
                        proceeding, and it is in connection with that portion of our Berber property
                        that we hope that our next flotation may be made. You will have observed
                        that Mr. Llewellyn regards this Negem mine as an extremely good prospect,
                        and states that the reef is strong and well defined, and can be traced
                        continuously for over half a mile. He further observes that an usually good
                        results have been obtained from it even close to the surface, and that there
                        is no apparent reason why the auriferous quality of the reef should not
                        become more pronounced below the weathered zone. He concludes by saying that
                        few reefs seen by him either in the Sudan or Egypt have been of greater
                        promise. A statement of that kind from so capable and cautious an engineer
                        as we have always found Mr. Llewellyn is extremely encouraging. He has
                        within the past two or three weeks been visiting the mine, and will be
                        shortly returning to England, when he will give us his latest impressions
                        regarding it. We hope that by the time we may be ready with a scheme for
                        dealing with this property, the market position in relation to Egyptian and
                        Sudan mining enterprises may have considerably improved. We still retain our
                        very large interest in the Sudan Gold Field, Limited. It is probable that
                        many of our shareholders are also shareholders in that company, and have,
                        therefore, seen the report issued by the Sudan Gold Field, Limited, in
                        October last in anticipation of the annual general meeting, which was held
                        on November 8th. That report was a very comprehensive and a very
                        satisfactory one. It may, however, be interesting for me to quote Mr.
                        Llewellyn's summary of the results of the operations at that mine for the
                        twelve months to June 30th last. He stages : "(a) Development of the main
                        reef through a practically continuous length of 2,000 ft., to depths varying
                        from 100 to 200 ft below surface. (b) Discovery end partial development of
                        three off shoots there from, one of which appears to be of as good value as
                        the main reef itself. (c) Discovery and development to a depth of 100 ft of
                        a seperate and distinct reef, which promises to greatly enhance the value of
                        the northern blocks. As an indication of the practical value of these
                        discoveries and the developments thereon, it may be said that over 1,000 ft
                        in length of the reefs opened is regarded as of payable character." And at
                        the conclusion of his report he remarked : 'I may say that the work of the
                        past year has, more than that of any previous period, impressed me with the
                        possibilities of the property you are here developing. The main reef has now
                        been traced beyond all doubt through a continuous run of 2,000 ft., and it
                        seems probable that it will be found to extend through the remaining 1,000
                        ft. to the western boundary. The continuity of the reef is, ipso facto, the
                        best argument for its continuation in depth, although on this vital question
                        the year's developments do not permit my carrying assertion much beyond the
                        point reached in my previous report to the syndicate. Development in depth
                        has been impossible in the absence of all machinery, except at greatly
                        increased cost; but at the few points where the reef has been followed
                        downward below the present drivage level there has been no diminution in
                        value of the ores shoots within their normal dip. On the contrary, as far as
                        I am able to form an opinion, the general tendency is towards improvement.
                        Should this view be correct there is little doubt that in Om Nabardi you
                        have a very valuable mine." We have, therefore, every reason to anticipate a
                        successful future for the Sudan Company, and we hope to see our interest in
                        it become of increasing value. In our report we also refer to an interest we
                        have acquired in the Dareheib and African Syndicate, Limited. That syndicate
                        is developing what is known as the Daraheib concession, in which are
                        contained the Oaib old workings, of which for some years a high opinion has
                        been entertained by mining engineers who have visited the property.</p>
                    <p>The Suakin Mining Syndicate, in which we hold in all 10,700 shares, was
                        originally formed to explore a property in the Suakin district. The result
                        of the investigation of the concession, however, was unfavourable, and that
                        syndicate has recently acquired under option a property in the Sudan 1,000
                        square miles in extent, forming a portion of the territory owned by the
                        Sudan Gold Field and situated a comparatively short distance from the Om
                        Nabardi mine and from the Government railway. It has therefore, facilities
                        for carrying on its exploratory work, and we hope to hear before long that
                        the expedition which is now prospecting the area has succeeded in finding
                        payable reeds. I have now, gentlemen, I think, touched upon the principle
                        point in the report excepting the matter of the accounts, upon which it is
                        not necessary to detain you for more than a moment or two. As we state in
                        our report, at September 30th, 1904, there was a credit balance at profit
                        and loss account of £84,460 12s 10d. On March 17th, 1905, a dividend of 5s
                        per share in cash was paid and with the distribution of 39,234 fully-paid
                        shares of the Sudan Gold Field, Limited, a total dividend of £52,500, or 100
                        per cent., upon the capital of the syndicate. That left a balance of £31,960
                        12s 10d, out of which had to be met income tax and the additional
                        remuneration payable to the directors and managers, and after taking into
                        acccount the further deductions to September 30th, 1905, you will notice
                        that we have a balance at the credit of profit and loss account at that date
                        of £19,090 17s 10d, which amount it is proposed to carry forward to the
                        accounts for the current year ending September 30th, 1906. At the meeting
                        held on February 28th, 1905, the capital of the syndicate was increased from
                        £52,500 to £80,000 by the creation of 27,520 additional shares of £1 each.
                        These shares were issued to the shareholders in the proportion of one of
                        such new shares for every two old shares, at the price of £1 10s per share,
                        or 10s per share premium. This new issue placed the syndicate in funds for
                        the continuance of its development work. When we next have the pleasure of
                        meeting you we trust that we may be able to report having succeeded in
                        floating a company to deal with the Negem mine, and that the company's
                        financial position is again such that we can recommend the payment of a
                        substantial dividend. I beg to move :––"That the report and accounts now
                        submitted be received and adopted." (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robert Taylor, in seconding the resolution, described the mining work
                        done during the year, and the resolution was carried unanimously.</p>

                        <p>The Polo Tournament was continued on Monday afternoon, two more ties
                            being played. Most unfortunately a ''hubbub" arose towards the end of
                            the first game which completely spoilt the rest of the polo, the
                            Tourists and the E.A. playing in a hurricane of wind and dust. The first
                            game between the Freebooters and Mosquitoes was quite good, and was
                            remarkable for the accuracy with which the latter team repeatedly met
                            the ball, and their extraordinary good shooting at goal, two of
                            Stockwell's goals and one by Graham being wonderful good shots. For all
                            that the Mosquitoes thoroughly deserved their victory and had a good bit
                            the best of the game. The Tourists continued their successful career,
                            defeating the E.A. rather easily. They have now won all their games, but
                            it is yet uncertain who they will play in the final on Friday. If the
                            60th win their game on Wednesday against the Freebooters the final will
                            be between these two teams. It will be remembered that by the conditions
                            of the tournament, the two teams scoring the most points meet in the
                            final irrespective of the points already made.</p>

                        <p>FIRST CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>From the throw-in Stockwell hit up, Rumbold returning. Graham got away
                            and with two big shots nearly scored, Dunbar clearing. The Mosquitoes
                            pressed and hit behind. From the hit-out Kennedy made a very good run
                            the whole length of the ground, just missing a subsidiary with his final
                            shot. Dunbar got away and Bartlett missing the former hit a goal with a
                            good clean shot. From the throw-in the Mosquitoes ran the ball down and
                            Stockwell hit a very good goal from a difficult angle. Freebooters, 1
                            goal ; Mosquitoes, 1 goal.</p>
                        <p>2ND CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>From the throw-in Graham hit up with a long shot, Rumbold returning. The
                            Mosquitoes ran the ball up but hit behind. From the hit-out Graham got
                            hold and with a fine long shot hit a goal from a difficult angle. From
                            the throw-in in the Mosquitoes again attacked and Bartlett nearly
                            scored, Rumbold saving with a fine shot across the goal which went
                            behind. Bartlett took the penalty, but Rumbold met the ball and Dunbar
                            passing to Kennedy the latter got away and with a good run hit a goal.
                            Up and down play followed the throw in. Dunbar got away and with a very
                            long shot hit a subsidiary. Both sides were now attacking in turn.
                            Dudgeon with a good shot passed to Stockwell, who hit a subsidiary. From
                            the hit-out Stockwell hit an extraordinary good goal from the boundary
                            line near the club house. Freebooters, 2 goals 1 sub; Mosquitoes, 3
                            goals 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>3RD CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>The Mosquitoes were first on the ball from the throw-in but Rumbold
                            returned well. Graham then hit behind. From the hit-out the Freebooters
                            attacked and Dunbar hit goal. On the game being resumed the Mosquitoes
                            pressed, Kennedy cleared, and Bartlett hit behind. The Freebooters were
                            now entirely on the defensive, and if it had not been for the good
                            defence of Dunbar and Rumbold they would have had a big score against
                            them. After several good chances Graham hit a goal. Towards the end of
                            the chukker Dunbar got away and looked like scoring but hit wide.
                            Freebooters. 3 goals 1 sub ; Mosquitoes 4 goals 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>4TH CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>Give-and-take play followed the hit-out. The Freebooters pressed and
                            Dunbar hit a goal. The Mosquitoes now attacked and nearly scored. Again
                            they attacked and all but scored, Dunbar saving well brought the ball
                            round and hit up to midfield. Graham returned. There was only a few
                            minntes left and the score level, the result was not long in doubt,
                            however, as Graham getting hold with a huge shot, hit a goal. From the
                            throw-in the Mosquitoes again attacked, Bartlett hitting up in front of
                            goal. The Freebooters had bad luck as Rumbold had an easy backhander but
                            the ball bumped and his pony kicked it through. Mosquitoes, 6 goals 1
                            sub; Freebooters, 4 goals 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>It was a good fast game with very rapid scoring on both sides. The result
                            was rather surprise as most people expected to see the Freebooters
                            victorious, but the Mosquitoes showed improved form both in combination
                            and hitting. For the winners all played well. Graham and Dudgeon hitting
                            particularly well. Stockwell also hit well, but he does not stick close
                            enough to his back. For the losers Rumbold and especially Dunbar played
                            brilliantly, the latter having to do more than his fair share of the
                            work.They were by no means well supported by their forwards and that was
                            where they failed.</p>

                        <p>FIRST CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>From the throw-in Paravicini hit up and Brakenridge returned. Rome
                            brought the ball across the ground, Akers Douglas centered well in front
                            of goal, when Paravicini, with a good backhander, hit a goal. From the
                            throw-in the E.A. attacked and Broadbent hit a subsidiary. From the
                            hit-out the E.A. again pressed and hit behind. Another hit-out followed
                            and Pickering made a good run up the ground. Rome missed badly and
                            Parravicini hit a goal. Several exchanges followed the ball going out.
                            Tourists, 2 goals ; EA., 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>2ND CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>From the throw-in the Tourists ran the ball down and scored a goal.
                            Brakenridge returned well from the throw-in and gave Broadbent a dear
                            run, but both he, Gordon, and Rome all missed a good chance of scoring.
                            The Tourists now attacked, Rome returning well. Back the Tourists come
                            again and Paravicini hit a goal. The E.A. were now mostly on the
                            defensive till just at the end of the chukker the E. A. ran the ball
                            down but hit wide. Tourists, 4 goals ; E. A., 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>3RD CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>On play being resumed Brakenridge hit up and Akers Douglas meeting the
                            ball returned to E.A. goal, where Pickering scored with a good shot
                            behind his pony's tail. From the throw-in Rome got on and with a good
                            run took the ball to the Tourist's goal and scored. The E.A. now
                            attacked. Pickering, meeting the ball, got away, but missing,
                            Brakenridge returned. Scrambling play followed, the ball going from one
                            side of the ground to the other. Pickering centred with a nice shot in
                            front of goal but Brakenridge cleared well. Again the Tourists attacked
                            and Akers Douglas scored a subsidiary. Rome took the ball from the
                            hit-out and made a very good run up the side line and looked like
                            scoring but Sparkes returned well and Akers Douglas brought the ball
                            back. Gordon then made a clear run but missed and Sparkes returned. Just
                            before time the E.A. very nearly scored, the ball going behind.
                            Tourists, 5 goals 1 sub ; E.A., 1 goal 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>4TH CHUKKER.</p>
                        <p>The last chukker calls for little comment, the Tourists pressing hard the
                            whole time. They scored two more goals, the best by means of Akers
                            Douglas, who with his good shots hit up to the E.A. goals, and
                            Brakenridge missing he hit through. Result : Tourists, 7 goals 1 sub. ;
                            E A., 1 goal 1 sub.</p>
                        <p>Not a good game, being greatly spoilt by the high wind and dust. The
                            Tourists had matters all their own way, being very sure on the ball and
                            combining. For the winners, all played well, Pickering and Akers-Douglas
                            especially hitting well. Sparkes had little to do. For the losers,
                            Brakenridge played best, his backhanders being very good. As a team they
                            never seemed to get together and there was a lot of missing.</p>

                            Saturday next when they are the guests of the Victoria College F.C. on
                            the College ground. This will be the fourth meeting of these clubs for
                            the season. The college XI. have had the better of the previous games,
                            running out winners on two occasions, and one game ending in a draw.
                            Tomorrow's game should be a good one and a good turn out of spectators
                            is looked for. Kickoff at 3 p.m. prompt.</p>

                    <p>Extract from the Report of Lt. Col. von Donop to the Board of Trade (England)
                        with reference to the recent accident at Witham, Great Eastern Railway, in
                        which, it will be remembered, ten people were killed and about twenty
                        injured.</p>
                    <p>DECEMBER 1905.</p>
                    <p>The third vehicle, a first class carriage, was also found derailed about 130
                        yards from the north end of the down platform, but its wheels appear to have
                        taken the rails of the through connection on the down main line leading to
                        the Maldon line, as it was alongside that connection that it was found
                        standing; <hi rend="italic">the gas in the cylinder underneath this carriage
                            appears to have been ignited, and all the woodwork of the upper portion
                            of the carriage was completely destroyed by fire.</hi> There was only
                        one passenger in this vehical, and he fortunately escaped.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <p>Attention should also be drawn to the fact that one of the carriages was
                        destroyed by fire, owing to the ignition of the gas in the cylinder
                        underneath the framework. Fortunately, no lives were lost thereby on this
                        occasion, but the occurrence points to the desirability of adopting some
                        other source of illumination, probably electricity.</p>

                    <p>As the outcome of this accident the Great Eastern Railway have decided to
                        equip <hi rend="italic">the whole of their main line rolling stock in the
                            future with Stone's System of Electric Lighting instead of gas as
                            heretofore</hi> and Messrs. Stone have already in hand very large orders
                        for their apparatus from the Great Eastern Railway, and, in fact, from
                        nearly every Railway in England, Scotland, etc.</p>
                    <p>It will be remembered that many similar fatal accidents have occurred, not
                        only in England, but in America and on the Continent.</p>

                    <p>KEARSLEY AND CUNNINGHAM'S WEEKLY REPORT</p>
                    <p>Liverpool, March 1.</p>
                    <p>The demand for Egyptian has been much smaller this week. Prices however, are
                        considerably dearer, especially for the fine qualities, which are in good
                        request. Quotations of Brown are raised 3/16d @ 1/4 per lb. ; but Fine is
                        exceptionally 1/2d lb. higher. Uppers are in less demand, and are only
                        1/16d. @ 1/8 up. In Futures a large speculative business has been done, and
                        prices have advanced considerably.</p>
                    <p>The following are the latest quotations :––</p>
                    <p>Mch. 9.5d June 9.4 Sept. 8.59</p>

                    <p>American Futures. The Market this week has displayed more activity; at the
                        opening, continued free liquidation and some "Bear" manipulation caused a
                        decline of 5 @ 6 points; but evidently the markets became sold out, and a
                        steadier feeling has prevailed, resulting in a recovery of 14 @ 15 points
                        from the lowest rates touched. The full improvement has not been maintained
                        ; but closing values are 7 @ 8 points above those of last Thursday. The
                        chief features have been the large takings of spinners whose requirements
                        are apparently much greater than had been generally supposed, less free
                        offerings from America, and some signs of a falling off in the movements of
                        the Crop, which, it is expected, will shortly become more accentuated.
                        Although the general sentiment is not what can be described as "bull-ish,"
                        there is an impression that prices can easily be carried upwards
                        temporarily. The latest values are delivery :––</p>

                    <dateline>Le Caire, 8 mars.</dateline>
                    <p>A Londres, le Consolide anglais a hausse hier de 3/8 a 90 3/4 et l'Unifiee da
                        1/4 a 103 1/2. La National Bank et l'Agricole sout egalement renseignees en
                        reprise de 1/8 a 27 5/8 et 10 1/4. La Daira Sanieh est restee invariee a 17
                        7/8.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, l'action Credit Foncier Egyptian a gagne 6 francs a 797. La Banque
                        d'Athenes a reagi de 3 franca a 144.</p>
                    <p>Notre marche des valeurs a presente, encore ce matin, la meme caracteristique
                        que ces jours derniers: la plupart des valeurs sont plus ou moina negligees;
                        en revanche, beaucoup d'animation et de transactions sur un groupe de titres
                        qui sont les favoris du moment.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank et l'Agricole ont cloture un peu plus faibles qu'hier a 27
                        7/16 et 10. Le Credit Foncier s'est inscrit a 792-793 et la Behera a 39.</p>
                    <p>Les actions Land Allotment ont avance a 3 15/16, presque a 4 en cloture; la
                        part de fondateur a hausse a 135.</p>
                    <p>L'action Immobiliere est restee a 386 ; la part de fondateur a hausse a
                        525.</p>
                    <p>La part de fondateur Enterprise and Development a gague encore L.E. 1 1/2 a
                        18 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Le mouvement qui s'etait dessine sur la Societe d'Entreprises et de Travaux
                        s'est accentue vivement ce matin; l'action a cloture a 4 7/16—1/2, et la
                        part de fondateur a 12 1/2 acheteurs, gagnant L.E. 2 1/2 en une séance.</p>
                    <p>A signaler, d'autre part, les Omnibus du Caire qui, de £20 3/8, cours d'hier,
                        ont cloture aujourd'hui a 26.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hotels, les Nungovich sont restes a 16 7/16 et les Baehler
                        a 6.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Estates se sont raffermis a £2; les parts de
                        fondateur ont atteint 10 3/16. Les Egyptian Constructions ont cloture a 1
                        3/4 et les Cotton Mills a 7 sh.</p>
                    <p>On nous fait remarquer que nous avons fait erreur hier en mettant a l'actif
                        de l'exercice 1905 de la Compagnie Immobilize d'Egypt l'enorme benefice
                        resultant de la revente de l'immenble de l'ancienne Zaptieh.</p>
                    <p>Ce profit et celui donne par la revente de l'ex-propriete Borelli, s'elevant
                        tous deux a environ 40,000 livres, doivent etre imputes a l'exercice
                        1906.</p>
                    <p>Au reste, si nos informations sont exactes, le total des benefices bruts pour
                        les deux premiers mois de l'exercice courant, atteint deja la somme de
                        60,000 livres, par suite de la revente de petite lots de terrain que la
                        Societe effectue presque journellement, depuis le 1er Janvier, aux
                        conditions les plus remuneratrices.</p>
                    <p>On a commence hier a traiter a la Bourse d'Alexandria les actions du Banco di
                        Roma, qui viennent d'etre admises a la cote officielle. Le cours pratique a
                        ete de Frs. 128.</p>
                    <p>Hier, a la meme Bourse, les actions Spinning and Weaving ont atteint £11/16
                        pour cloturer a £l sur des realisatioms. Le bruit courait que la Societe
                        paierait un premier dividende.</p>
                    <p>A l'assemblee generale ordinaire de la Cassa di Sconto ce di Risparmio, tenue
                        dimanche passe a Alexandria, le dividende de l'exercice 1905 a ete fixe a
                        P.E. 34 par action sur les 25,000 actions des anciennes emissions P.E. 25
                        1/2 sur les 25,000 actions de l'emission 1905. Ces sommes sont payables a
                        partir du 12 du courant.</p>
                    <p>Les assemblees generales extraordinaire et ordinaire de l'Egyptian
                        Improvements Corporation ont eu lieu hier dans l'apres-midi au Caire. Les
                        propositions du conseil d'administration tendant a porter le capital-actions
                        a £200,000 et a creer des obligations jusqu'a concurrence de £100,000 ont
                        ete adoptees.</p>
                    <p>Un dividende de P.E. 10 par action a ete vote. Il est payable des le 12 du
                        courant a la Banque d'Athenes.</p>
                    <p>Nous prions les personnes qui veulent bien nous transmettre des
                        communications pour notre Circulaire d'avoir l'obligeance de signer leurs
                        lettres ou leurs envois, non pas que nous entendions faire le moindre usage
                        de leur nom, mais simplement pour mettre notre bonne foi en garde contre des
                        surprises possibles.</p>
                    <p>Les cours du coton arrivent en petite baisse d'Amerique. Hier, le disponible
                        a perdu 5 points, le Mai et l'Octobre 6 points respectivement.</p>
                    <p>Les arrivages ont ete de 20,000 balles contre 24,000.</p>
                    <p>Le marche de Liverpool est plus ou moins stationnaire.</p>
                    <p>Ici, le Mai, qui avait fici hier soir a 20 5/32, a ouvert ce matin a 20 3/32
                        pour eloturer a 20.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These express steamer's have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very
                        high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially
                        built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going
                        straight through to England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi
                        which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements
                        for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the
                        fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
