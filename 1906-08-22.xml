                    <p>The "Temps," in a remarkable article, shows that Mustapha Pasha Kamel is no
                        friend to the Egyptians, and is working with Baron von Oppenheim in the
                        interests of Turkey, which wishes to make Egypt a Turkish vilayet. The
                        sooner the Egyptians realize the nature of their supposed friend, says the
                        journal, the better for them. Englishmen are already aware of Mustapha
                        Kamel's antecedents and intentions. The "Temps" says that his campaign will
                        only produce an evolution in British policy towards a protectorate or
                        annexation.</p>

                    <p>We regret to announce the death of Antonio F. Inglott Bay, who was one of the
                        oldest members of the British colony at Alexandria. He was born in Malta in
                        1831, and was the son of the late Vincent Inglott, chief clerk and cashier
                        of the Commissariat of the British Army in Malta and of Armenia, the
                        daughter of a Neapolitan merchant. He came to Alexandria in 1855, and was
                        appointed chief clerk to the Egyptian Railway Administration, where he
                        remained for some years, afterwards becoming a coal merchant. He rendered
                        great services to the British Army during the "Events," and for these
                        services was made a Bey and was also presented with a magnificent
                        chronometer by Queen Victoria. He retired from business fitteen years ago
                        and had been in good health until quite lately, when he caught cold in the
                        langs owing to drinking iced lemonade while perspiring. Complications set in
                        and he died yesterday evening at 8 o'clock. He had been a widower since
                        1872. He leaves three sons and a daughter. His brother is Mr. Saverio
                        lcglott, chief shipping clerk, cashier, and Pro-Consul at H.B.M.'s Consulate
                        at Alexandria. The funeral of the deceased will take place to-day, from his
                        residence, 24, First Khedive street, at 4.30 p.m.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE PRINCE MOHAMED IBRAHIM.</head>
                    <p>A pleasing anecdote of the good nature of the late Prince Mohamed Ibrahim is
                        told by. a contemporary. His Highness was staying at Geneva, and while out
                        one day he was flicked in the face by a cab-driver, who had meant the whip
                        for some boys who had got on to the back of the carriage. The cabman was
                        much distressed at his mistake, but the Prince good- naturedly would have
                        none of his apologies but stood him a drink.</p>
                    <p>It was at Geneva also where last winter the Prince had that nasty fall from
                        his horse that nearly cost him his left leg, and his recovery was thanks
                        entirely to the skill of the practitioner who attended him.</p>
                    <p>August has, it seems, been fatal to the Prince's house. In that month his
                        grandfather died in a railway accident; his father died in August, and so
                        did the Princess, his first wife, in 1900.</p>
                    <p>The Prince had just acquired a fine residence in the Avenue Kleber, Paris,
                        where he intended spending the winter.</p>
                    <p>The Princess Salibab, the widow of the Prince, will probably not leave Paris
                        as she expects to be confined shortly.</p>
                    <p>The Prince was a Miralai in the Egyptian Army.</p>
                    <p>It is not yet known when his mortal remains will be brought to

                        18th ult. :- Egypt, one of the few steady, consistent and friendly allies of
                        Australia at the International Postal Convention at Rome, has entered into
                        an arrangement with the Commonwealth by which the postage between her
                        territory and Australia is reduced to 1d. per ounce, and vice-vers â to 2d.
                        When making the announcement yesterday Mr. Chapman, Postmaster- 1 General,
                        remarked that the Egyptian Postal administration is one of the most
                        progressive in the world, and its representative at the congress, Siba
                        Pasha, one of the cleverest and most accomplished men he ever met. "Egypt,
                        Australia and America stood together in the battle for the universal penny
                        postage system in the congress, and in the end we shall win," said Mr.
                        Chapman. "Some people sneered at our vote as only a demonstration, but they

                    <dateline>Port Said, Tuesday.</dateline>
                    <p> For the last few days three Turkish transports have been lying in Port Said
                        harbour with troops en roate for Hodeidah to join Feizi Pasha in his
                        atttempt to quell the rebellion in the Yemen.</p>
                    <p>The mer, judging from what one can see from the shore-for no one is allowed
                        on board the ship being in quarantine, - seem a lusty, hardy lot of fellows.
                        Peuned up on board almost like animals in a cage, allowed neither to go
                        ashore nor receive anything therefrom, they sit for hours gazing from their
                        floating prison at what is going on ashore. It is hard to think that
                        probably of the present 2,000 going to Southern Arabia few will return as
                        the many thousands of the troops poured in last year have succumbed to
                        scurvy, typhoid, and the other scourges of a campaign conducted under the
                        most adverse conditions.</p>
                    <p>As the rebels are once more in possession of Sanaa, with their position
                        greatly strengthened by their previous victories and the joining of the
                        warring tribes as well as actual deserters from the invaders, it looks as
                        though the struggle would drag on as long as it is hoped to maintain the
                        country as a Turkish province.</p>

                    <p> The Turkish troopship Bars, which was towed to Suez yesterday by the B. I.
                        steamer Warora, is still lying at anchor in the Suez rads. Contrary to her
                        commander's statement, it was discovered that she had on board 535 troops,
                        of whom 70 are sick and wounded.</p>
                    <p>It is stated that her hospital on board is in a horrible condition, on
                        account of the filth. The medical officer, on examining it, almost fainted
                        from the smell. Among the sick, it was found that two of the unfortunate
                        soldiers were already dead, which fact was not declared on arrival as the
                        hospital had apparently not been visited for many hours.</p>
                    <p>I understand that the steamer will be towed through the Canal shortly, owing
                        to the danger of having such a crowded vessel at Saez.</p>

                    <p>The following information respecting the progress of the Hedjaz railway from
                        Damascus to Medira and Mecca is derived from a trustworthy source. This time
                        last year 514 kilomètres of theline had been constracted, carrying it as far
                        as Maan. Since then the progress of the line has been somewhat retarded by
                        the simultaneous construction of the connecting line from the coast at
                        Haifa. The main line, has, however, been continued to the station of Tebuk,
                        making up to the present 692 kilomètres. The earth- works have been advanced
                        some 3) kilomètres further, but it is estimated that it will take three
                        years more before the line can be completed as far as Medina. Meanwhile, the
                        line from Haifa inland, of which only 104 kilomètres were constructed this
                        time last year, was completed up to Dara for the Sultan's name day. Indeed,
                        some trains have already begun to run on this section. Furthermore, a large
                        railway station is being built at Haifa and is now almost finished.</p>

                    <p>Quite a stir took place on board the French S.S. Floria on its arrival on the
                        12th inst. at Algiers. It was conveying home from the Hedjaz a party of
                        three hundred pilgrims who had been sent on from Alexandria at the expense
                        of the Egyptian Government. It appears that seventy, who were Algerians, had
                        without the permission of the French Governor General embarked at Moroccan
                        and Tripolitan ports, and no sooner had the Floris put into harbour than she
                        was boarded by an official of the Prefecture who took them into custody.

                        States, recently visited Egypt, and is sending impressions of his visit to
                        the American Press. In his remarks on the Cairo Museum he says:--</p>
                    <p>"I am constrained to offer one criticism of the museum in passing. It is
                        under the control of a French society, and the only catalogue obtainable is
                        printed in French. While most e of the exhibits bear a brief description in
                        both French and English, some are labelled in French only, and a few not at
                        all. As there e are no guides to show a visitor through the numerous rooms
                        and point out the principal objects of interest, those who are anable to
                        tread Franch are at a great disadvantage. Considering the number of English
                        and American tourists, it seems strange that more attention should not be
                        paid to their accommodation."</p>

                    <head>SINAI MINING CONCESSION CASE.<lb/>RESULT OF APPEAL.</head>
                    <p>In the Court of Appeal, before the Master of the Rolls and Lords Justices
                        Moalton and Farwell, last week, the case of Diamant v. Bawick Moreing and
                        Co. was heard, on the application of the defendants for judgment or new
                        trial on appeal from verdict and judgment at trial before Mr. Justice
                        Lawrance and a special jury.</p>
                    <p>The action was brought by Mr. Hermann Diamant to recover from the defendants
                        damages in respect of the defendants' alleged breach of a contract relating
                        to a mining concassion in Egypt, made between the parties on 25th January,
                        1900. The plaintiff, a German, came to Cairo in 1890 and practised as a
                        physician. While there he became aware of the possibility of working the
                        turquoise mines in the Sinai Peninsula, and in 1899 he was in a position to
                        promote a concession for working the mines, and was approached by Dr.
                        Goldstone, an agent of the defendants, with a view to the concession being
                        obtained by the defendants. The concession was ultimately obtained for the
                        defendants, and an agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and the
                        defendants by which it was agreed that, in consideration of the plaintiff
                        having materially assisted the defendants to procure the concession, the
                        defendants would give him 15 per cent. and all the profits of whatever
                        nature that might accrue from the working of the mines, after deducting all
                        working and management expenses and moneys and interest that under the
                        concession should be paid to the Egyptian Government. It was further
                        provided that in the event of the defendants capitalising the mines the
                        plaintiff should receive a like percentage of the capital stock, less the
                        amount necessary for the working capital, the percentage being payable
                        one-third in cash and two-thirds in stock. In 1900 a syndicate was formed
                        called the Egyptian Development Syndicate, Ltd., and the main question
                        between the parties was whether by the formation of the syndicate the mines
                        had been capitalised within the meaning of the contract. The trial resulted
                        in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for £725 damages, hence the
                        present appeal. Mr. Rafas Isaacs, K.C., and Mr. Atkins appeared for the
                        appellants, and Mr. Duke, K.C., Mr. Lashington and Mr. R. Sutton for the
                        respondent.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the arguments of counsel Master of the Rolls in giving
                        judgment said that the case had given him a great deal of difficulty, and he
                        felt that at all events the case would have to go down for a new trial, as
                        the decision of the jury could not be allowed to stand. The difficulty he
                        felt was in being able to make up his mind whether or not there was an issue
                        of fact to ba determined and whether there was any evidence fit for the con-
                        sideration of the jury; or farther whether they oaght not to take the matter
                        into their own hands and decide the case on a point of law. He came to the
                        conclusion that the Court was in the position of dealing with the matter as
                        question of law arising under the agreement between the parties. The
                        question of law was whether the formation of the company not to work, but to
                        find out whether it was worth working these mines, was such a company as
                        could be said to have been capitalised within the meaning of the agreement,
                        so as to admit of the assertion that in the events which had happened the
                        plaintiff was entitled to the sum he claimed. Rading the agreement as a
                        whole, he came to the conclusion that the capitalisation agreed upon was the
                        capitalisation of a company for working and not for exploring. The plaintiff
                        to succeed was bound to show that a company for working the mines had been
                        formed, but he had not proved that, but merely a company for prospecting. He
                        came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was not able to show that the
                        condition precedent to the right which he had claimed had been performel,
                        and therefore there must be judgment for the defendants. The Lords Justices
                        concurred and the appeal was accordingly allowed with costs</p>

                        the beneficent British rule. According to the official returns jast
                        published, the total receipts of the Exchequer for the six months ending
                        June 30.h amounted to no less than L.E. 6,686,526, against L.E. 6,391,048 in

                        tribute the trifle of L.E. 269,015. L.E. 386,699 were spent on irrigation

                    <head>THE MORGANS AND THE WAR STORES REPORT.</head>
                    <p>Colonel Morgan was stationed for so long in Cairo and his brother made so
                        many friends at Alexandria during the time he was coal inspector at Gabbari
                        for the E.R.A., that it is pleasant to know that the War Stores Com-
                        mission's Report declares that there is no evidence of fraudulent conspiracy
                        against either Col. Morgan or Mr. F. C. Morgan.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners report very fully on the relations of Colonel Morgan,
                        Meyer, Limited, and Mr. F. C. Morgan (the colonel's brother). The last named
                        was cabled to in Egypt by his brother to come at once to a "permanent posi-
                        tion, £1,200 a year," and went into Meyer's employ. Col. Morgan swore that
                        he did not know this, but the Commissioners report that this "seems
                        improbable in view of the close relationship and daily meetings of the two
                        brothers, and is not consistent with F. C. Morgan's own statement that
                        Colonel Morgan contemplated his serving under Meyer until Meyer tendered,
                        and only objected to his doing so when that event took place."</p>
                    <p>The dates suggest the truth, says the report. When Colonel Morgan was
                        director of supplies, and local contracts were probable, Meyer was willing
                        to give Colonel Morgan's brother employment at £1,200 a year, nominally as
                        managing clerk, but, in tact, for the performance of services of a more
                        mechanical kind. But as soon as Colonel Morgan was recalled and left the
                        country his brother's employment ceased by mutual arrangement, and F. C.
                        Morgan received a bill for £300 at three months. F. C. Morgan did not, in
                        fact, do any more work for Meyer . . . and the latter purporting to show a
                        formal resignation as from November 1 is at variance with the truth, and was
                        probably intended to conceal the previous employment by Meyer.</p>
                    <p>"We are of opinion," add the Commissioners, "that this arrangement with Meyer
                        for the employment of F. C. Morgan was contrary to the spirit and letter of
                        the King's regulations. "There is no evidence to support the suggestion that
                        Colonel Morgan received any pecuniary consideration from Meyer or any other
                        contractor.</p>
                    <p>"We find no evidence to show that any fraudulent conspiracy between Colonel
                        Morgan and Meyer and Frank Morgan ever existed." The Commissioners, in
                        concluding this part of their inquiry, say that they are compelled to add
                        that Colonel Morgan "can hardly complain if his conduct in these matters has
                        given rise to grave suspicion."</p>

                    <p>LETTER FROM THE SULTAN'S NEPHEW.</p>
                    <p>AN INTERESTING STATEMENT.</p>
                    <p>A long and interesting letter addressed by Prince Sabah-ed Din to Sir E. Grey
                        appears the "Times." Prince Sabah-ed-Din, who is grandson to the late Sultan
                        Abdul Medjid and nephew to the present Sultan Abdul Hamid, went into
                        voluntary exile more than six years ago in order to carry on his opposition
                        to the present régime at Constantinople in the interests, as His Highness
                        contends, of liberty, justice, and civilisation in Turkey.</p>
                    <p>The letter, which voices the opinions of the Turkish Liberals who are
                        striving to free their country from the yoke of arbitrary rale, discusses
                        the question of Pan-Islamism, which was raised a few weeks ago by Sir E.
                        Grey in the House of Commons. In the course of his remarks the writer
                        says:-</p>
                    <p>"Of all Islamic peoples the Turks, owing to their geographical position, have
                        always been the readiest to adopt the ideas of Western civilisation, which
                        attracts the younger Turks irresistibly and has their whole-hearted
                        sympathy. In social matters no event of any importance ever take place
                        without supply ing them food for study and meditation, The present régime
                        having checked the economic development of the Turkish nation, the more
                        enlightened representatives of young Turkey have devoted themselves to
                        intellectual studies, and by dint of persevering efforts have acquired an
                        intellectual outlook which is quite up to date. It is not on ground thus
                        prepared and cleared henceforth of every germ of fanaticism that the seed of
                        a reactionary and anti- Earopean policy can ever succeed in striking root.
                        But the Government, openly averse as it is to all reforms, however
                        legitimate and argent they may be, and distracted in presence of the
                        steadily rising tide of emancipation, has conceived it necessary to enfold
                        itself within a 'spiritual mantle' in the endeavour once again to save the
                        tottering edifice of despotic rale trom utter rain."</p>
                    <p>Prince Sabah-ed-Din proceeds to show the necessity of Tarkey keeping on
                        "correct if not on friendly terms with all the Powers," and concludes by
                        stating :-</p>
                    <p>"With the triumph of Liberal ideas in Turkey the great moral influence which
                        Constantinople possesses over Islamism at large is destined to assume an
                        intellectal character. Such an influence would then serve a powerfal agent
                        of reconciliation between the two worlds. But the goodwill of the East alone
                        could not accomplish such a needful task. It desirable that the action of
                        Europe in the East should be more equitable and more respectful be m of
                        human dignity. It is on this condition only that progress and peace may be
                        secured there," But this reservation does in no way hinder us from rendering
                        justice to your noble country for her colonial administration, which is
                        unquestionably of all Earopean administrations the most favourable to the
                        liberty of nations."</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>LONDON, August 15.</p>
                    <p>The War Minister has officially informed the country that the Egyptian
                        garrison is to be permanently increased by a cavalry regiment of the line, a
                        battery of Royal Horse Artillery, and four companies of infantry, which have
                        been lately transferred from Crete. In the face of Lord Cromer's report on
                        the anrestful state of Egypt, which has been further excited by speeches
                        from members of the House of Commons, we believe that further
                        re-inforcements will be necessary if we are to remain masters of the
                        Egyptian situation.</p>
                    <p>-</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Coldstream Guards embark for Egypt at the end of next week, and the
                        tact of its going abroad on important foreign service is taken as an in
                        fication that it may not after all be disbanded. The battalion is an
                        exceptionally fine one, well up to strength in all ranks, and as the
                        reduction of the Guards is greatly disapproved in hith quarters it i just
                        possible the Government may see the folly of doing away with so serviceable
                        a unit and reconsider their decision. It will be grossly unfair to the 3rd
                        Scots Guards if they are dis' anded on return home, for foreign service
                        entails great hardship on both officers and men, and they ought not to be
                        compelled to bear these and then experience the disappointments and
                        difficulties attendant upon disbandment. Married officers, non-commissioned
                        officers, and men are to bear the cost of the move to Egypt just as though
                        the battalion were to be retained, but they ought to be met by the
                        authorities in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Colonel C. S. Ewart, at present military secretary to the Minister for War,
                        has be. n selected to succeed Major-General J. M. Grierson as Director of
                        Military Operations. Colonel Ewart is well known in the service as a capital
                        staff officer. He has seen a good deal of field service, having been in four
                        expeditions in Egypt, and was twice mentioned in despatches, being also
                        rewarded with a bravet-lieut.-coloneley and the 5th class Medjidieh. He was
                        also in the late South African war on the staff, where he was twice
                        mentioned, and received a bevet-colonelcy and was created a C.B.</p>
                    <p>A well-deserved appointment is that of Colonel E. S. Eardley Childers from
                        half-pay to be Chief Engineer of the London District in the room of Colonel
                        N. M. Lake, appointed Chief Engineer of the Eastern Command. Colonel
                        Childers is the third son of the late Mr. Hagh Childers, who for years held
                        office in Mr. Gladstone's Government, his last appointment being that of
                        Home Secretary twenty years ago, and he has written an excellent biography
                        of his father. The gallant effi er has an excellent record of thirty-three
                        years' service in the Engineers. He served throughout the Afghan war, taking
                        part in Lord Roberts's famous march to Kandahar, and in the Egyptian
                        campaign against Arabi Pasha he was aide-de camp to Lord Wolseley. Co'onel
                        Childers also served in the Nile expedition of 1884 85, and he was created a
                        C.B six years ago. He married Miss Florence Leslie, daughter of Mr. William
                        Leslie, of Warthill, Aberdeenshire.</p>
                    <p>What work will Lord Kitchener take up cn leaving India? There are important
                        posts in this country that he could fill, says the "Daily New," and I fancy
                        that his brilliant gifts of organization will not be allowed long to remain
                        idle. He is only 56 years o'd. One would like to have his candid opinion of
                        War Offi se administration under the Brodrick and Arnold- Forster
                        régimes.</p>
                    <p>There is no foundation for the statements that the Dake of Connaught is to be
                        appointed Commander-in-Chief in India when Lord Kitchener's term of office
                        expires. I believe, says the London correspondent of "The Manchester
                        Guardian," that the Duke's name has never been considered in connection with
                        this appointment. The authorities have already made their selection of a
                        saccessor to Lord Kitchener, and it is generally understood in the service
                        that General French, who retires from Aldershot during the coming autumn,
                        will be offered the ap pointment.</p>
                    <p>The tinned meat scandals have caused much trouble with military authorities
                        in their dealings with the soldiers on Salisbury Plain. It is officially
                        announced by Major General W. E. Franklyn that preserved meat is in fature
                        to be issued to the troops at Tidworth Garrison once a month. As this meat
                        has to be inspected by a Board of Officers, all commanding officers of units
                        are to arrange to have tins open ready for inspection by the Board on the
                        morning of the day of consumption of the meat.</p>

                    <p>Some interesting discoveries have been made by the divers engaged in the
                        explorations in and about the Bay of Navarino. Sixteen out of the 72 sunken
                        Turkish ships are still to be seen at the depth of 125ft. in the bay. In the
                        Channel of Cerigotto the divers found the remains of an ancient galley,
                        which was conveying bronzes, at a depth of 164ft. ; it is 160ft. long by
                        33ft. broad; bat it is now a mere hulk, and has been filled np with 5ft. of
                        sand. The precise epoch of the galley, the "Morning Post" correspondent
                        says, has not been ascertained, but some details of its constraction are
                        unique in the history of ancient shipbuilding. Eleven amphoræ, of the Roman
                        period, have been brought up from the wreck.</p>
