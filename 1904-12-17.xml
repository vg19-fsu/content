                    <head>RAISING OF ASSOUAN DAM.</head>
                    <p>In his recent observations on the raising of the Assouan dam and the future
                        of the Phile temples, Mr. Somers Clarke strikes a happy mean between the
                        extravagances of the autim quarian sentimentalist and the brutality of the a
                        materialistic advocate of raising the barrage to in any possible height
                        without taking any mea-C sures to guard the Ptolemaic ruins and those of t
                        the half-civilisation of Ethiopia from destruction. E The latter class of
                        men is, we are thankful to a say, rare enough, but the sentimentalist is
                        always with us, and his past attempts to prevent the construction of a work
                        of astonishing economic value by describing the perils that, would encompass
                        relics of the most degenerate period of Egyptian Art, would have been
                        laughable had they not given a cue to those prejudiced observers of the
                        British control over Egypt who longed and prayed for the breakdown of the
                        reconstructed Delta Barrage, and foreseeing the success of the Assonan weir,
                        used every effort to prevent its construction. </p>
                    <p>We have every sympathy, with those who urge upon governments the necessity of
                        pref serving monuments or natural beauties from vandalism or profanation,
                        and of establishing 'sanctuaries" where strange or rare forms of life may
                        find an abiding place. But if in the early years of the last half of the
                        19th century an energetic naturalist had clamoured for the preservation of
                        the Fens from drainage and tillage on the ground that a peculiar fauna and
                        flora would perish, would the ague-stricken inhabitants have borne with him
                        any more than their mediaeval ancestors would have borne with some
                        enthusiast in advance of his time, who urged upon them the preservation of
                        bears and wolves as a remarkable and picturesque feature of the wooded
                        midlands We can imagine cases where the preservation of ancient monuments is
                        imperative in the interests of art and know ledge, but will anyone argue
                        that it would have been better to spare the Phila temples the risk of
                        ultimate delapidation than to enrich a country which, through circumstances
                        not under its own control, had fallen into sore financial straits and was
                        still in bondage to its creditors. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, there is no reason to suppose that Phil is irretrievably doomed. If
                        the Govern ment can see its way to afford the small neces sary sum for the
                        support and maintenance of the roof and architraves of the temple, it will
                        doubtless survive, as Mr: Somers Clarke states, "for an indefinite period."
                        That the Govern ment, which has already spent LE18,000 on the underpinning
                        of the foundations, will for a moment grudge the necessary money, is
                        unthinkable, and we think that a grant might well be set aside for the explo
                        ration of some of the temples and sites south of Phil, which have never
                        been. properly explored, and which are of some hig torical interest, in that
                        they are situated on that borderland between Egypt and Nubia which was
                        alternately ruled by the Pharaohs and by the Ethiopian kings. We are glad to
                        know that the matter is to be thoroughly examined, and we hope that if
                        private enter prise fails to come forward the Government may see its way to
                        equipping an expedition, composed of a few experts who will examine those
                        less-known ruins which are certain to be submerged by the raising of the
                        dam, and take records of their most important features before the Nile
                        covers them for ever. </p>

                        <p>Mr. Chamberlain has reopened his campaign by addressing 4,000 workmen. He
                            dwelt especially upon the advantages his policy possessed for the
                            working classes. He pointed out that it is impossible to maintain
                            protection of labor with unrestricted imports of paupers and cheap
                            foreign goods, made cheaper by artificial means. Unless his reforms are
                            adopted, the workmen will have to accept lower wages or lose their
                            employment. This question is one of life or death for the working
                            classes. Mr. Chamberlain also forcibly recapitulated his imperialistic
                            arguments. </p>

                            eye. Famagusta enjoyed great importance in the Levant during the middle
                            ages, but since its capture by the Turks in 1551 it has been an utterly
                            dead city. </p>

                            issued, accompanied by a statement of the number of animals tended
                            during that period. The latter comprise :-in 1902, 57 horses, 51 mules,
                            119 donkeys, 2 camels, 9 calves, 9 sheep, 37 goats, 2 monkeys; in 1903,
                            64 horses, 32 mules, 92 donkeys, 1 camel, 3 calves, 8 sheep, 35 goats.
                            The amount of subscriptions is ridiculously small for a society formed
                            for such an object as this one. In 1902 they amounted to the miserable
                            sum of P.T. 505, while in 1904 they were absolutely nil! The main income
                            of the society seems to be derived from the sums paid for the treatment
                            of animals under the society' care, which amounted to P.T. 4,320 in 1902
                            and P.T. 4,475 in 1903. A balance of P.T. 25 was all the society had in
                            hand to commence work in 1904.</p>

                        the Pyramids and a Venetian fête on the Nile. The committee intend to
                        arrange for a performance of one of the great Italian operas (probably Aida)
                        to be given at Luxor in the course of the next winter season of 1905-6, and
                        also to discuss the question of an International Exhibition to be held on a
                        later date in the Capital. The pro- posal has been submitted by our confrère
                        M. Paul Manse, proprietor and editor of L'Egypte. The committee is composed

                        GAZETTE.</head>
                    <p>Sir,-Referring to a statement which appeared in the issue of the Phare
                        d'Alexandrie of 21st Sept., 1904, under the heading "Allen, Alderson &amp;
                        Co., Ltd.," relating to a steam thrashing machine competition which had been
                        held at Evora, in Portugal, in which Messrs. Ruston, Proctor &amp; Co., of
                        Lincoln, and other firms took part. The paragraph in question states that
                        the firms of Clayton &amp; Shuttle worth, Limited, Lincoln, and Marshall
                        Sons &amp; Company, Limited, Gainsborough, entered for the competition and
                        afterwards withdrew, an absurd reason being alleged that these two firms
                        recognised the superiority of the Ruston machine. </p>
                    <p>Feeling convinced that it was extremely unlikely that the facts were as set
                        forth we communicated with Messrs. Marshall, Sons, and Company, Limited, of
                        Gainsborough, for whom we act as representatives in Egypt, and we are now in
                        receipt of their explanatian. We are authorised to state that Messrs.
                        Marshall, Sons, and Company, Limited, definitely declined to enter or take
                        part in the trials referred to, it being difficult for them to consider
                        same, owing to excessive pressure of work in all their de partments, caused
                        by an extraordinary and record demand this season for their machinery, which
                        taxed to the utmost even their well- known and unequalled manufacturing
                        facilities. Further, they were strengthened in their decision not to compete
                        on learning that Messrs. Clayton and Shuttleworth were unable to take part,
                        and thus the trials could not be considered representative of the leading
                        makers. </p>
                    <p>The statement in the paragraph in question is therefore untrue and
                        misleading, and is cal- culated to prejudice the interests of Messrs.
                        Marshall (the largest firm in the trade), the excellence of whose machinery
                        is universally acknowledged. </p>
                    <p>We request that you will kindly insert this letter in your valuable paper in
                        order to cor rect the misrepresentation complained of. </p>

                        <p>One of the most vital. public questions in the United States for many
                            years, and constantly agitated in the National Congress and before the
                            public, has been that of the irrigation of the arid lands of the rich
                            and fertile agricul- tural sections in the Western states. </p>
                        <p>Only a few days ago the latest national irri- gation congress was held in
                            the city of El Paso, Texas. It was the largest and most represen tative
                            gathering of the kind ever held, and President Roosevelt not only
                            strongly commended its objects, but pledged his official efforts to
                            secure action by the coming national legislature. Interest in the action
                            of the New Orleans gathering is still acute and is somewhat intensified
                            by the investigations in this country of M. K. E. Bakhati, engineer of
                            the Irrigation Department Projects Office of Egypt. </p>
                        <p>The gentleman from your country attended the national congress at El Paso
                            and, in addition, visited the Far Western states of Colorado, Utah,
                            Wyoming, Nevada, and California, in which there are millions of rich
                            arid lands and where the matter of irrigation of the soil is the most
                            important factor in all public affairs. The coming of Mr. Bakhati from
                            Egypt, the ancient land of irrigation, to study the American methods in
                            the matter, was something of a surprise to the engineers and scientific
                            agriculturalists of this country. In an interview in Chicago regarding
                            his mission in this country, Mr. Bakhati said, in part :- </p>
                        <p>"I find that one great difference governs American and Egyptian
                            irrigation. Egypt com- paratively is level, while American irrigation
                            must consider great slopes. In Egypt the whole water distribution is by
                            gravity, but in Ame- rica you have immense machinery which is both
                            complicated and efficient. But of all I have seen in America I am taking
                            with me as. suited to Egyptian irrigation but one machine, and that is a
                            marvellously delicate instrument to measure the velocity of the water." </p>
                        <p>While a visitor to the recent congress at El Paso, Mr. Bakhati made an
                            address to the delegates in which he fully explained in a very
                            interesting manner the Egyptian system of irrigation, giving many minor
                            details that were new to Americans, even to those who had carefully read
                            of the subject as it affects Egypt. </p>
                        <p>When the congress opened at El Paso President Roosevelt sent a letter to
                            the delegates expressing regret at his inability to be present, but
                            commending the purposes of the congress and declaring that irrigation
                            and all other interests of the country were interlaced, as irrigation
                            would make the West prosperous, and if the West prospered it would cause
                            other sections of the country to prosper as a result. In irrigation the
                            President found that expansion would be most effective. </p>
                        <p>The convention generally reported favorably on measures now pending
                            before the national congress in the interest of irrigation, and adopted
                            memorials urging more definite action to carry out Acts which have
                            already been passed by Congress to aid states which are putting systems
                            in operation. </p>

                        <p>The Teatro Verdi gave a rather uneven performance of Gioconda on
                            Wednesday night. Signora Popovici was certainly the best all through;
                            Signor Baldelli and Signora Fabri did well in their respective parts;
                            but we were not greatly impressed with the other members of the company.
                            The orchestra gave an admirable rendering of the music of the 'dance of
                            hours' but we were surprised to see no dance !. We cannot on the whole
                            pronounce the perfor mance to be on the same level as those of Mignon or
                            Aida, or indeed Carmen. And we hope that this was more in the nature of
                            an 'off-night," and that Otello will once again show the company at
                            their best.</p>

                    <p>Port Said, Friday.- Yesterday, while the S.S. "Queensland" was taking up her
                        moorings, her anchor cable parted. She lost her anchor and about 20 fathoms
                        of chain cable. Visions of salvage fees soon attracted a large crowd of Arab
                        boatmen to the spot, but the captain of the "Queensland" preferred taking
                        the more orthodox course of applying to the Canal Company for a European
                        driver with his gear to recover the chain than trusting to the primitive
                        methods of the native. The driver arrived, and in due course a rope was
                        attached. to the submerged chain and buoyed. But the wily Arab was not to be
                        so easily deprived of, what he considered, his just pay, so when the
                        "Queensland" men proceeded to pick up the rope they found that it had been
                        severed under water by some native. By this time quite a little water
                        carnival was taking place, the 3 laudable, if futile, efforts of the Port
                        Police increasing the amusement. The Canal Com- pany's diver refused to go
                        down again, unless the police could clear the course, fearing that his
                        air-tube might be treated in the same manner as the rope, and to the great
                        delight of the Arab, ingenuity, coupled with a disregard of law and order,
                        prevailed, and the job was handed over to them and speedily accomplished.

                        was disem- barking at the passport pier at Port Tewfik, owing to the

                    <p>The Greek national concert given last night by Messrs. Sakellaridis at the
                        Khedivial Hotel was a very great success. The large "salle des fêtes" of the
                        hotel was thronged with a most attentive and appreciative audience, composed
                        of the cream of our Greek colony, delighted to hear the melodious songs of
                        their country. Mr. Th. Sakellaridis conducted the full orchestra with
                        masterly skill, the Greek national dance "Sirto" eliciting an enthusiastic
                        encore. Messrs. I. &amp; A. Sakellaridis, (father and son) sang, together
                        and separately, a great number of Greek songs so charmingly, and with such
                        art and delicacy, as to arouse loud applause and encores. What may be termed

                        <p>Yesterday the inaugurating competition of the ninth season of the Helouan
                            Golf Club took place and proved a decided success. The weather was
                            simply splendid, although the scores were not up to the usual average.
                            Fulford, the professional to the Bradford Golf Club, and son of W.
                            Fulford, the well-known professional at Northwood, had got the links in
                            excellent order, and it was difficult to find an adequate excuse for the
                            scores returned; but no doubt in future com- petitions, which will take
                            place almost every Friday, the play will be on a much higher level. On
                            the 18-hole course we are glad to welcome the success of Mr. Stewart
                            Fildes, who played a steady game throughout and returned a useful 85,
                            which for these somewhat redoubtable links nearly always obtains a
                            place. Dr. Page-May was unfortunate in topping an iron shot into the
                            railway, or his gross score of 91 would have been considerably less. On
                            the 9-hole course Miss Sargent, who has been known for some years in
                            golfing circles at Helouan, tied for first place with Miss Hobson, and
                            the tie will have to be played off later. Mrs. Page-May was only one
                            stroke less. Mrs. Lye is evidently a very promising player and we shall
                            expect to see her higher up in the list before long. Below is a list of
                            the scores: </p>

                    <p>Among the various matters of local interest to which the attention of readers
                        of the Gazette is drawn by means of letters, reports and leading articles,
                        no subject is of greater or more pressing importance than that of the
                        Trainage of the town. When its bearing on the health and well-being of the
                        people is taken into account, it is very extraordinary to note the apathy
                        that exists and the want of public spirit that keeps the question so much in
                        the background. </p>
                    <p>1 remember reading a very exhaustive report on the subject which was
                        published, I think, early last year. In this it was pointed out that the
                        very small fall obtainable here rendered the disposal of the sewage a very
                        difficult matter; but still difficulties far greater are overcome by
                        engineering science, and no doub some means could be devised by which the
                        sewage could be carried out to sea sufficiently far to enable. it to be
                        dispersed without danger to the health or annoyance to the olfactory nerves. </p>
                    <p>Important too, and quite apart from the question of drainage, is that of the
                        smells, which, in some places, are simply overpowering and to my knowledge
                        cause, not only much discomfort, but positive illness. Are there no bye-laws
                        in force requiring owners of vacant building spaces to effectually enclose
                        them, and thus prevent Arabs from invading them, and causing a nuisance to
                        surrounding houses! </p>
                    <p>It is quite time that someone moved in these matters and took away from the
                        fair city of Alexandria the reproach of its being "a city- of sinells." In a
                        short tale which appeared in the Gazette a few months ago, the writer
                        suggested that the simplest way of directing a stranger in this city would
                        be to tell him to "follow the smell he was now in and take the third smell
                        to the left." Many a true word is spoken in jest,and in this instance the
                        cap-fitted admirably, for the whole place at times reeks with filthy smells,
                        many, I am persuaded, capable of being done away with, once and for all, by
                        the exercise of a little vigilance on the part of the Sanitary Department of
                        our Municipality. </p>
                    <p>Probably few foreign residents in Alexandria visit the neighbourhood of
                        Pompey's Column, so the disgraceful state of the area surrounding the
                        greatest monument of the past that this city possesses passes unnoticed. The
                        side on which are the steps provided for visitors is just tolerable, but
                        venture, if you can, on a hot sunny day to explore the other portions of the
                        space! It wants a strong stomach to be able to do so, I can assure you. </p>
                    <p>It is a well-established fact that few resi dents in a city containing
                        interesting relics of the past, ever take the trouble to visit them, but
                        perchance, as the old Roman tower close to Ramleh station is to be
                        demolished, some people may wish to take a last look at it, before it
                        finally disappears. Let me warn any such to provide themselves with a
                        handkerchief soaked liberally with eucalyptus oil or some powerful
                        disinfectant. They will need it! And as to the state of their boots after
                        their venture, well, the less said the better! Verbum Sap. </p>
                    <p>In one sense the removal of the old remains will be welcomed by all who
                        fréquent the greatly improved sea frontage and appreciate healthy
                        conditions. But so long as the dis charge of sewage takes place underneath
                        under their noses, I am afraid that the new sea wall will offer little
                        attraction to promenaders. - </p>
                    <p>The pity of it all! Fine handsome buildings coupled with drainage that is
                        condemned on all hands as miserably inefficient; nice walks and drives on
                        the neighbourhood that it is impossible to frequent at least with any sense
                        of enjoyment and safety to health;- objects of interest that it is
                        impossible closely to inspect. All this and more, too, under a Municipality
                        that seems to lack eyes to see and noses to smell. </p>
                    <p>Have we to wait for an epidemie of cholera, plague, or typhoid fever before
                        anything is done to remedy this most serious state of affairs! It would
                        almost seem so for public spirit appears to be at so low an ebb here, that
                        there is no sign of any pressure being brought to bear on the authorities,
                        and the sanitary de- partment, left to itself, shows so little signs of life
                        that it must be almost hopeless to expect any action from that quarter. </p>
                    <p>I have occupied a good deal of space this week with a very unsavoury, though
                        important subject, and with but faint hope that any good will result from
                        what I have written. Perhaps some day means will be devised to greatly
                        lessen, if not entirely abolish, these nuisances; --meanwhile we must all
                        trust that no epidemic will come to stir up and awaken the sleepers, for we
                        should live in hope if we die in despair. </p>
                    <p>Alexandria's sanitary needs, have received a sad and striking illustration
                        this week in the death from small-pox that occurred in the Deaconesses'
                        Hospital. The immediate establishment of a small-pox hospital on a suitable
                        site a little way out of the town, and there must be many such sites
                        available should at once be seen to. The matter is really urgent and it
                        would not take many weeks to erect or adapta building for temporary use. I
                        have no doubt that the foreign residents here would all join in the movement
                        if only some public-spirited. man would take the lead. </p>
                    <p>Would Mr. G. B. Alderson spare a little of the time he devotes to the Housing
                        Problem -which so many think might wait a-while- to agitating this very
                        important matter! Universally respected as he is, he would easily secure a
                        hearing on a question affecting all the hospitals of the town, and the thing
                        could be quickly arranged with the cooperation of a few of the wealthy and
                        influential resi- dents of Alexandria, whose purses would surely open
                        readily for such an object. </p>
                    <p>And while this is being done by private enterprise our Rip Van Winkles could
                        sleep placidly on, and be left to rub their eyes and wonder when-if
                        ever-they awake. </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, is not this a question that ought to come within the range of
                        vision of the British Advisers of the Egyptian Government, seeing how
                        vitally it concerns Englishmen in Egypt I wish that, on the subjects about
                        which I have written this week, as well as many others, I could gain Lord
                        Cromer's ear. Then I might, perhaps, do some little good. </p>

                    <head>THE RESURRECTION OF OLDEST EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Though this book bears Canon Rawnsley's name on the title page, by far the
                        most inter- esting part of it is the first half, by his son, Mr. Noel
                        Rawnsley, which is, in effect, a sketch of the daily life in Prof. Petrie's
                        excavation dcamp at Abydos. It gives a moving picture of the minor
                        discomforts of camp life, including a grimble at having to eat porridge,
                        biscuits, and tinned meat for breakfast, while others a are indulging in
                        eggs and other luxuries which seems to throw some light on the schooly
                        breakfast controversy lately raging in the news papers and shows also the
                        difficulty of dealing with the natives. One is, perhaps, rather astonished
                        to find that an antiquity dealer, in whose "bulging bag you may find
                        something you want," is allowed to visit excavation camps, and that the work
                        sometimes included the throwing down of "an ancient wall." Also we get a
                        glimpse of the somewhat slender foundation on which many Egyptological
                        theories are based, when we read that, "knowing the dynasty to which a
                        certain shape of pot belonged, it became possible to tell at once the times
                        in which the wall that covered it was built." The most frantic partisan of
                        "sequence-dates" has not yet contended that n the fashion in pots changed in
                        Egypt with every dynasty; and if this is all that the excavators had to
                        depend upon, it is plain that they must often have gone very wrong in their
                        dating. For the rest, Mr. Rawnsley writes a fresh and hearty appreciation of
                        the delights as well as of the drawbacks of life in the desert, and his
                        remarks on the difficulty of forming any idea of the general design of the
                        sand-buried buildings on which he was engag ed should prove useful to
                        intending explorers. </p>
                    <p>The second part of the book, by the nominal author of the whole, was at first
                        sight a puzzle. Canon Rawnsley seems to have been inspired by a visit or two
                        to the Egypt Exploration Fund's annual exhibition in Gower Street to write
                        of Prof. Petrie's doings at 0 Abydos in such lyrical phrase as the follow-
                        ing:- </p>
                    <p>"The old temples of Abydos refused to listen to the sound of harper or
                        flute-player in the days when Osirian mysteries went forward; but there is
                        an older burial-ground beyond the temples, where today the triumphant song
                        of the explorer is loud, and the mysteries of the resurrection of Egypt's
                        oldest kings go forward to such historic harmonies as were seldom be fore
                        heard." </p>
                    <p>As he tells us on another page that as "patient, peace-loving Prof. Petrie"
                        has "virtually re-dated Greek civilisation," we may hope that these historic
                        harmonies may not be heard again. Later we are told that Prof. Petrie's
                        discovery at Ballas of the New or Neolithic race which, by the way, he
                        referred to an 0. interval between the fourth and twelfth dynasties-led
                        Canon Rawnsley to expect that Prof. Petrie would "yet be able to report of a
                        chapter in Egyptian history which would make the first dynasty king a kind
                        of compar atively modern being," and we gather that, in his opinion, this
                        curious report has now been made. This is the more extraordinary because it
                        was M. Amélineau and not Prof. Petrie who first discovered the early remains
                        at Abydos. It was he who unearthed and published the inscriptions of such of
                        the first dynasty kings as have absolutely been identified with those in
                        Manetho's lists, and he has never ceased to complain that his concession
                        was, as he alleges, taken from him and handed over to Prof. Petrie before he
                        had finished his work upon it. Astonishment deepens when we read that when
                        Canon Rawnsley visited the exhibition in question his eyes "went at once to
                        the little bit of crystal vase which bore the name of Mena; for now seemed
                        to feel myth fade away, and the real king who drank from a crystal goblet to
                        the success of the city of Memphis, the city he had .built in fair fields,
                        from which he had turned the great Nile flood, seemed to stand before me." </p>
                    <p>For the little bit of crystal vase, as may be seen in the Egypt Exploration
                        Fund's Royal Tombs, Part I. does not bear the name of Mena at all, but only
                        that of Aha, and was not discovered by Prof. Petrie, but as there stated,
                        bought by him, perhaps from some of the dealers who, teste Mr. Noel
                        Rawnsley, hang about his camp. </p>
                    <p>The explanation of all this is, doubtless, .that although the hands may be
                        those of 5. Canon Rawnsley, the voice is that of Prof Petrie. In other
                        words, Canon Rawnsley, who seems to have no special knowledge of his subject
                        other than that afforded by a few trips to Egypt, has preferred, instead of
                        forming his own opinions, to listen to Prof. Petrie's voluble .theories. He
                        has supplied laudatory adjectives . to nearly every substantive, and
                        indulged in much apostrophic admiration of Prof. Petrie and his works. We
                        must say that we prefer the Professor's energetic, if sometimes slipshod,
                        English at first hand. (Athenæum). </p>

                    <head>THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION,</head>
                    <head>WITHDRAWAL FROM EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>BY ALURED BELL.</p>
                    <p>It is surely very curious, and not a little pathetic, this epoch-marking
                        decision to with- draw from Egypt the last remnants of the military majesty
                        of Britain. We are assured that the step has the approval of Lords Cromer
                        and Kitchener; and certainly the Foreign Office in the one case, and the War
                        Office in the other, need no better names to endorse any cheque that they
                        may draw on the con- fidence of the British electorate. Again, the
                        Anglo-French agreement is admittedly a blessed instrument it promises a free
                        hand to England in Egypt, and a free hand to France in Morocco, but no one
                        who has resided in North Africa will deny that it is quite incapable of
                        allaying fanaticism or quieting the racial hostility to the European.
                        Therefore, I am confident that I voice the first feeling of Anglo- Egyptians
                        when hearing of the resolve to withdraw the British garrison from Egypt-
                        and, indeed, of the hundred and forty thousand Europeans in the country-in
                        laying stress on a note of uneasiness. On the other side of the ledger,
                        however, we have several satisfactory assets. In the first place, since
                        1888, the British garrison has never exceeded five thousand of the three
                        arms, and is to-day considerably below that figure. There is the blessed
                        Angio-French agreement referred to above. The Egyptian people, particularly
                        the peasants, to the number of some nine millions, have become accustomed
                        to, and have con- fidence in, British administration. The Egyp tian and
                        Sudanese soldiery have fought many a dangerous field under their British
                        officers, and are no longer the ill-tutored rabble of the days of
                        Tel-el-Kebir, Kassassin, and El Teb. There are one hundred and fitty British
                        officers in the Egyptian Army to-day compared to the seventy or eighty
                        previous to the reconquest. of the Sudan in 1896-98. The old and
                        incorrigible native advisers of the young Khedive have gone the way of
                        flesh, or have retired from the cares of State, or are supposed to be to-day
                        the most exemplary of Anglophiles. There remain not even a Swiss Rounler
                        Bey, nor a Greek Comanos Pasha, as in 1894, to give stily anti-English
                        advice to the youthful, ambitious Vali. The prime ambition of the Egyptian
                        youth is to learn the English language as a passport to a comiorble salary
                        under Government, and to qualify for a subsequent liberal pension. The
                        Egyptian Gazette no longer troubles to read lectures to the Arabie and
                        French Press, which merely maintains a daily criticism of Lord Cromer's
                        administrative measures, as a duck persists in swimming, from instinct or
                        natural propensity. Finally, as a closing argument to the excellent
                        amicability of the modern Egyptian, bail-cartridge has not been served out
                        to the British garrison of Cairo in anticipation of a street riot, since the
                        spring of 1893. </p>
                    <p>The familiar letters G.O.C., the bearer of ,which has always taken precedence
                        of the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army in Cairo society,are to be transferred as
                        an appendage to the title of Major General Sir Reginald Wingate, the present
                        Sirdar. Sir Reginald will have more than fifteen hundred miles of country to
                        patrol, north to south, with his 150 British lieutenants. Should one of the
                        Egyptian battalions in Cairo mutiny, what will be the Saar's remedy? He has
                        already decided. He wi!! call upon two or three Sudanese bat- talions to
                        keep the peace. The ultimate appeal from any such conceivable resort to
                        force will, of course, be the British Army proper, which may then be engaged
                        elsewhere. I am drawing a black picture merely to emphasise the import- ance
                        of the decision now auiounced to with- draw our Egyptian garrison. We may
                        heartily congratulate ourselves upon the emphatic testimony which this
                        decision gives to the solidarity and acceptability of twenty-two years of
                        British civilian and military adminis tration in Egypt. The desire fora
                        purely civilian control was announced to the world so long ago as 1882 by
                        the victor of Tel-el-Kebir, Lord Wolseley. It is recorded in official black
                        and white, that the Britisit military occupation would cease when no longer
                        necessary to the welfare of the country. Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone
                        promised it, but have not lived to see this day. I am almost tempted to say
                        that if the Japanese people have startled the world with their efficiency,
                        the military evacuation of Egypt must startle the world with its
                        complacency. Will France ever with- draw her prospective garrison from
                        Morocco Has France withdrawn from Tunis ? Can Japan withdraw from Korea?
                        Will Russia evacuate Kushk, or the United States of America, take their last
                        roughrider from the Philippines? </p>
                    <p>It will justly be a gala good-bye that the residents of Alexandria will
                        accord to the last departing troopship as she weighs anchor within the
                        purview of the Khedive from the windows of the Palace of Ras el-l'in.
                        Egyptian gunners will man the fort of Kom el Dik. After all, one had almost
                        forgotten that Napoleon sneaked out of Egypt, while we shall go out in sight
                        of every eye. The British Govern ment tried to reform Egypt, and has done
                        it; and perhaps not the least of its credit there lies in the men it has
                        loaned to the Egyptian" Army. We "advise" India, with several thousand
                        officers-about one lieutenant to every seventy-five thousand of her
                        inhabitants -the hundred and fifty Bimbashis that we leave in Egypt will
                        advise even a smaller number of tellaheen per capita. Commanding them will
                        be the brilliant chief of Lord Kitchener's Intelligence Department, a
                        soldier who would be an ornament to any European General Staff, and having a
                        lengthy expe- rience of his duties and a scholarly know- ledge of Arabic.
                        Sir Reginald Wingate has witnessed the metamorphosis worked by his brother
                        officers in the army now to be entrusted with the sole policing of the Nile
                        Valley and Delta, and has doubtless affirmed his belief in the sufficiency
                        of tuat army for the future internal duties of the peace. Complacent race as
                        we are, we have, therefore, competent guarantees that the departure of the
                        "red- coated devils" from Cairo and Alexandria is indicative of no
                        strategical aberration on the part of our native genius for empire. When
                        again called upon they can return.</p>

                    <head>THE CONSTANTINIDI CASE</head>
                    <p>The Constantinidi case is attracting con- siderable attention in Egypt, as
                        both the parties have many relations and connections here. Mr. Constantinidi
                        is the brother of the Countess Antoine de Zogheb, of Cairo, and the uncle of
                        Mr. A. G. Kefhala of Alexandria. The respondent is the daughter of the late
                        Mr. Stephen Ralli, many of the representatives of whose family are in Egypt.
                        Last week, in the London Divorce Court, Sir F. Jeune again, had before him
                        the case of Constantinidi v. Constantinidi and Lance, which came on by way
                        of an application against a Régistrar's re port on variation of settlement.
                        This was the suit in which the petitioner was awarded £25,000 against the
                        co-respondent, Dr. Lance, who had attended on the wife's father, the late
                        Mr. Raili, the well-known Greek merchant. Mrs. Constantinidi, it appeared,
                        was interested in two settlements, one of £51,000, made by her father, and
                        the second, a post-nuptial settlement of £10,000 by the petitioner upon her.
                        It was pointed out that respondent and co-respondent had been married, and
                        were now enjoying the income from these settlements, and there would be an
                        increased income at the mother's death, Mrs. Lance being entitled to about
                        £150,000. Mr. Lawson Walton, K.C., for the petitioner, said it was against
                        that he wished to appeal. The result of all this litigation was that the
                        petitioner had become indebted to the extent of £10,000, whereas by the
                        report the petitioner was put back in exactly the same position as he was
                        before he was married, while the wife was to enjoy all the advantages of a
                        separate income, attributable to their being married, and the co-respondent
                        had possession not only of the lady herself, but also of a very large
                        income. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Walton continued his arguments on behalf of the petitioner. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Bargrave Deane, K.C., on the other haud, pointed out to his Lordship that
                        in all the cases which had been cited against him the petitioner had been an
                        innocent party, whereas the petitioner in this case had himself admitted
                        that he had been guilty of misconduct. </p>
                    <p>Sir F. Jeune decided that the petitioner should receive a sum not exceeding
                        £2,000 a year out of the settled property. Mr. Barnard pointed out that the
                        amounts in dispute would not realise more than £2,200.</p>

                        <p>Catarrh is a very frequent cause of that class of diseases popularly

                        writes as follows concerning Peruna: </p>
                    <p>"I was suffering from catarrh of the throat and head. One of my college
                        friends, who was visiting me, asked me to try Peruna and I did so and found
                        it all and more than I had expected. It not only cured me of the catarrh,
                        but restored me to perfect health."-Alice Dressler, </p>
                    <p>Miss Mamie Groth, Platteville, Wis., writes: </p>
                    <p>"I have for several years suffered with frequent backache and would for
                        several days have splitting headaches. Several of my friends advised me to
                        take Peruna and I asked my physician what he, thought of it. He recom mended
                        it and so I took it and am entirely without pain of any kind now." -Mamie

                    <p>"Some six years ago my husband suf- fered with nervous prostration, and
                        advising with a friendly druggist he brought home a bottle of Peruna. His
                        health was restored from its use, his appetite was increased and restful
                        sleep came to him."-Ida L. Gregory. </p>

                    <p>"I suffered for over a year with female trouble, and although I tried several
                        physicians none of them seemed to be able to help me permanently. </p>
                    <p>"It only took a little over three bottles of Peruns to make me well and
                        strong. Inever have backache, headache or bear ing down pains any

                            contracted the disease. It is a duty which the hospital owes not only to
                            itself but to the public at large, and it would be most satisfactory for
                            all parties to have a statement of the hospital's case. It would be a
                            source of great satisfaction it the hospital could, for example, declare
                            that there was no contact between the attendants on the patient already

                        <p>Sir, Although a member of the British community, I did not know the
                            unfortunate young Englishman Yousbashi Armstrong. I can only speak of
                            what I have read in the newspapers. Ever since coming to Alexandria, I
                            have felt strongly upon the subject of there being n British hospital in
                            this city. Surely, this is the time for some action to be taken in this
                            matter. A properly equipped British Cot- tage Hospital would not cost a
                            fabulous sum. I would commend this idea to the philanthropie spirit of
                            Mr. Alderson, in lieu of the much- vexed question of the housing of the
                            artisan class. I feel sure an appeal for funds for this object would
                            meet with a generous response from every member of the British community
                            here. The hospital in which this young Englishman contracted the disease
                            by which he met his death no doubt does good work, but when one reads of
                            a patient, concalescent from one disease, contracting another within the
                            walls of the hospital, there is something wrong somewhere. If the
                            infection is in "the Air" the sooner the occupants of the adjacent
                            houses quit their abodes the better.</p>

                            venture to believe, of all your readers. The deep feeling displayed by
                            that effusion and the strenuous earnestness of its style characterise
                            .it as a "human document" in the best sense of that term. Will not the
                            Khedive and Lord Cromer take up the exhortation of Mr. Geo. B. Alderson?

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Sir, I read in the Gazette this
                            afternoon that Article 11. of the new Pharmacy Regula- tions is still
                            the crux of the question between my confrères at Cairo and Sir Horace
                            Pinching. As a practical pharmacist, I am strongly of the opinion that
                            on public grounds, no less than in the interests of us chemists, Article
                            11 of the new Regulations is objectionable. When, as now, the proprietor
                            of a pharmacy is required to hold a diploma, there is far more kelihood
                            that the drugs sold will be of supe- rior quality and the prescriptions
                            dispensed with greater care than when he is not. In the latter event,
                            owing to the increased expense of employing a duly quantied chemist as
                            manager, there will be a strong temptation to run the business "on the
                            cheap." Furthermore, Art. II is calculated to multiply considerably the
                            num- ber of chemists' establishments-a by no means desirable contingency
                            so lar, at least, as Alex- andria and Cairo are concerned, where they
                            are already greatly in excess of public require- ments and to render
                            thereby competition amongst us unduly severe, which again is not for the
                            public benefit.</p>

                        <head>AN ANGLO-EGYPTIAN GAUGE OF SELF-ESTEEM.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir, I was inspired on reading your notice of "Who's Who" for 1905 to
                            look up the biographies of the eminent Anglo-Egyptians- whose names you
                            mentioned as appearing there. The world knows little of its greatest
                            men, and in Cairo we are so brought into contact with the crowd of
                            K.C.M. G.'s and M.V.O's, and lesser notabilities that we little think
                            how great they really are until we are reminded that they have been
                            thought worthy of inclusion in the 50,000 "eminent" men who figure in
                            "Who's Who." Thus it came about that I purchased a copy of that work and
                            care- fully perused the histories of the gentlemen. While doing so I was
                            struck by the strange dis- crepancy between the length given to the
                            various personages, and as they give the details themselves and correct
                            the proofs it is clear that, by a comparison of the length of these
                            gentlemen's notices, we can gauge roughly their capacity for
                            self-esteem. Leaving out the Khedive, Lord Cromer, and the Sirdar,
                            details about whom are too easily obtainable for the editor of "Who's
                            Who" to trouble them, I arrived at the following results by counting the
                            lines in the notices of the other Anglo-Egyptians whose names you gave.
                            Of all, the one who takes up the largest amount of space with minute
                            details as to his career is Mr. Malcolm Mcll- wraith, the Judicial
                            Adviser, who takes no less than 22 closely printed lines to narrate his
                            life and works. The extreme antithesis to this is Mr. Harry Boyle, who
                            thinks that one line and a quarter is all the information that the world
                            should know as to him. The Judicial Adviser is run very close by
                            Crookshank Pasha with 22 lines, while Mr. Boyle's proxime accessit is
                            Coles Pasha with one word over two lines. The order of the others is as
                            fol- lows Mr. Foster 21, Dean Butcher 18, Captain McMurdo 17, Sir
                            William Garstin 15, Sir Elwin Palmer 13, Sir Horace Pinching 13, Sir
                            William Willcocks 12, and Chitty Bey 7. I was unable to find the names
                            either of the Financial Adviser or the Adviser to the Ministry of the
                            Interior. Meanwhile, further inspired by your notice of the names of
                            Anglo-Egyptian and other local celebrities who figure in the
                            Anglo-African "Whos Who," I have written to London for a copy of that
                            work, and as soon as I have leisure I hope to spend many a quiet evening
                            in perusing the lives of the members of the British Recreation Club and.
                            of other Anglo-Egyptians who appear to figure prominently in that
                            remarkable com pilation.</p>
