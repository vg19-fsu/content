                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can

                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be

                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or

                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot

                    <head>EGYPT'S "MORAL RETROGRESSION"</head>
                    <p>Some years ago a member of the Anglican Church announced to an amazed world
                        that Cairo was the "grave of the soul," and if our memory does not betray us
                        gave a reasonably full account of the moral shortcomings of the population
                        of the Capital. Whether any attempt was made to defend the reputation of the
                        Cairene by qualified advocates, we know not, but Mr. John Robertson, M.P.,
                        has clearly taken up the mantle that has fallen from the shoulders of his
                        predecessor and in an article entitled "The Moral Retrogression" has accused
                        the Administration of being-indirectly of course-responsible for the
                        increase of crime in Egypt. Mr. Robertson's thesis may be summed up as
                        follows. While revenue has increased crime has increased, thanks to the fact
                        that popular instruction has been neglected and that omdehs are no longer
                        selected by the inhabitants of villages but are appointed by the Central
                        Government. Moreover, the Government, according to Mr. Robertson,
                        "encourages" servility among its employés, with the result that its "omdehs"
                        deteriorate or become simply trucklers to the Administration. The whole of
                        Mr. Robertson's thesis is based upon three assumptions : 1. That crime is
                        absolutely on the increase ; 2 That intellectual training per se can
                        moralise ; 3. That the Egyptians of to-day are less moral and inore servile
                        than formerly. We have here three bold premises on which Mr. Robertson's
                        conclu-ions depend. The first is the hardest by far to prove or disprove,
                        for what we require is not the knowledge that more persons were imprisoned
                        for cattle poisoning, say, in 1903 than in 1893, etc, etc., but accurate
                        data covering long periods of years both before and after the British
                        Occupation. Such data are unobtainable end we must therefore fall back on
                        historical evidence. </p>
                    <p>We learn that in Lane's days crimes of violence were prevalent among the
                        fellaheen The author of the "Modern Egyptians" states that faction fights
                        were prevalent in the 'thirties among the villagers, who were also addicted
                        to theft and murder, that the crimes of the "Saad" and "Yemen" parties were
                        frequently of an atrocious nature and contrasted with the generally
                        law-abiding behaviour of the towns people. Men went unpunished in the
                        country for offences which would have been visited with instant decapitation
                        by the stern Mohamed Aly, had they been committed within reach of his police
                        and soldiers Further, we have the opinion of Sir Richard Burton--perhaps a
                        more reliable authority on Oriental matters than Mr. John Robertson. The
                        great Orientalist, Hadji, and traveller described the Egyptian peasantry in
                        the 'sixties ag singularly prone to crime and deceit. It is true that he
                        was, per contra, over inclined to emphasise the superiority of the pure
                        Arabs and the warlike peoples of Western Asia, but his evidence cannot be
                        dismissed as valueless. In Ismail's days crime appears to have diminished to
                        some extent owing probably to the severity with which criminals were
                        punished, and above all to the fact that the whole population was occupied
                        in preserving or attempting to preserve its very existence from
                        tax-gatherers, usurers, and inspectors of the Corvée. A people that is
                        desperately trying to live has little opportunity for the indulgence of
                        vicious "tendencies or for the perfection of ethical virtues. After Ismail's
                        days crime remained stationary for a while and then increased, and we have
                        given Mr. Robertson's explanations of this phenomenon above. They are in our
                        opinion insufficient. We do not know, to begin with, whether Egypt is more
                        criminal than in Mohamed Aly's days, nor do we know how far the increase
                        lately noted may not be a purely temporary phenomenon. We know something of
                        its causes : the wholesale annexation of a code framed for highly civilised
                        peoples and its application to men still in a lower stage of moral
                        development than most Europeans ; the revival of the traditions of feud and
                        faction which had been in abeyance in Ismail's later days ; the discovery by
                        the criminally minded that the kourbash had been abolished and that prisons
                        were getting to resemble hotels (from the fellah point of view). </p>
                    <p>What about education ? Mr. Robertson would ask. Would it not have
                        counteracted the other tendencies? We are doubtful, for we are not yet
                        convinced that a community can be morally saved merely by education. It is
                        all very well to point to noble agnostics--moral free-thinkers and the like,
                        but what proof have we that secular education alone cap in a generation make
                        a race exceptionally virtuous ? What we do realise is that Islam, which is
                        the religion of an enormous majority of the Egyptians, has, owing to the
                        neglect of its leaders, had little moralising effect on the masses. Had the
                        Moslem leaders of Egypt been animated by the same moral zeal that fired the
                        Indian and Russian-Tartar reformers, the moral condition of the fellabeen
                        would be higher. A man does not necessarily become better because he is
                        cleverer; his increased intelligence is often enough expended in baffling
                        the policeman. But we are assured that public opinion will control him and
                        that thanks to the growth of servility under the British Occupation such
                        public morality is fading away ! If so why did the moral and independent
                        public of Egypt lift no voice and raise no hand against the tyranny of
                        Ismaili Why did no patriot among the followers of Arabi protest against the
                        massacre of Europeans at Alexandria and the torture of Turkish officers at
                        Cairo ? Why was Egypt allowed to go to ruin ? Servility exists in Egypt but
                        as a legacy, a survival from a terrible and tyrannous past, and how long, we
                        may ask, I would Ismail Pasha in his prime have borne with Mustapha Pa-ha
                        Kamel British influence in Egypt has created the Nationalist party ; it has
                        taught Egyptians to exercise their rights of free speech for the first time
                        in their history, and Mr. J M. Robertson would have us believe that it has
                        encouraged servility! </p>

                        to develop the great amount of new business which the parent company is
                        unable to cope with, and which is somewhat outside the scope of the objects
                        which the Egyptian Estates was origin. ally intended to deal with. It is an

                        deprecated by the British Chamber of Commerce but the leading European
                        merchants of Alexandria, without any distinction of nationality, have joined
                        in protesting against the movement in favour of handing over the control of
                        the finances of the country to an Egyptian Parliament. </p>
                    <p>The members of such important international institutions as the Alexandria

                        (Association du Commerce d Importation) have signified their approval of the

                        protest to Lord Cromer and of passing a resolution against any material
                        change in the existing system of Administration. Both these influential

                        of Egypt's commercial capital, have forwarded their protests against the

                        followed by other Chambers of Commerce at Alexandria. In fact, the European
                        capitalists of Alexandria are practically unanimous in holding that any

                    <p>It is stated that M. Grandmoulin intends claiming damages to the extent of
                        L.E 5,000 from the newspapers which have libelled him. </p>
                    <p>The Parquet will question the Omdeh of Warrak on the matter, as Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel has declared that he only gave the facts of the case in
                        accordance with the information contained in the let er from the omdeh. </p>
                    <p>We regret to see that our contemporary the "Egyptian Standard" fails to
                        explain away the atrocious charge which it recently brought against M
                        Grandmoulin. The English organ of Mustapha Pasha Kamel recently asked, as we
                        noted in our leading article of Tuesday last : "How is it possible that M.
                        Grandmoulin still keeps his Government employ accused and guilty as he is of
                        assassination? </p>
                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard" in reply says : "The sentence which the "Egyptian
                        Gazette" has the kindness to draw our attention to is at its very worst but
                        ambiguous. In itself it implies no accusation on our part nor a prejudgment.
                        When its context is compared with all our other statements in the same
                        paragraph (and which the "Egyptian Gazette" took care not to print in
                        italics) it is self-evident that no doubt whatever could cling to our
                        meaning in writing those words, namely that M. Grandmoulin had been accused
                        of something he had done. Because, the moinent the shot went off while the
                        gun was in M. Grandmoulin's hands, and killed a boy, it is certain that
                        before the law M. Grandmoulin was not innocent of a charge brought against
                        him. As to its being a wilful or an involuntary act we expressed no opinion
                        whatsoever in any one of our organs. The word employed by us to designate
                        the act accident which had taken place, was simply and solely one of three
                        at our disposal." </p>
                    <p>Nobody can consider that the above futile explanation in the slightest degree
                        clears or contemporary. The point is not what the writer meant by his
                        statement, but what would his readers understand him to mean, and there
                        unfortunately can be no question about the meaning of the phrase guilty as
                        he is of assassination. </p>

                    <p>A Greek carpenter for two years past had been living with a Greek girl of the
                        name of Mirka Souloyanni in the Mousky quarter of Cairo. A few days ago a
                        cousin of the woman arrived in Cairo and was invited to spend last Sunday at
                        their residence. The guest had only just sat down at table when he suddenly
                        asked his hoste if they were married. They replied in the negative but added
                        they would get married as soon as they had the money. Their guest, whose
                        name is Gheorghi Souloyanni, thereupon rose from the table and declared that
                        he would never go back to their house until they were married. He, however,
                        returned on Tuesday and, finding his cousin alone, plunged a knife into her
                        three times. The assassin, who is a Greek subject, has been incarcerated in

                        received with much faith by the judicial authorities, who believe that there
                        may be other and more sinister motives. The unfortunate woman died without

                        ents keenly and well contested. The tent pegging was better done than in
                        previous years, some of the squads and individuals—distinguishing themselves
                        greatly; while the displays of physical drill, gymnastics, sword v. bayonet,
                        and bayonet v lance, etc, were all worth watching. The wrestling on
                        horseback supplied an unusual feature, a horse getting rid of its nose bag
                        and seizing a trooper by the forearm. As far as one could see, however, the

                    <head>THE ITALIAN OPERA SEASON.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <p>Italian Opera in Cairo came to an end last week. It is with mixed feelings
                        that one must summarize the performances, some of which were admirable and
                        some deplorable. The first performance of P ccini's "Bohème" was about the
                        best piece of work I ever saw in Cairo, there were really great moments in
                        "Mefisto fele," "aida" was excellent, and the march therein remarkable.
                        "Fedora" was good, as weg "Tosca," very good in parts, and there were
                        pleasing moments in most of the pieces. "Carmeu" I committed, that was quite
                        excellent But we must set against this many disappointments ; and as these
                        were due to arrangements and singers we may as well cite names. Signora
                        Isaia rather spoilt "Faust." She is a type of what the Italian soprano can
                        be, too florid and with excessive and wearisome vibrato. Signora Fabris,
                        though conscientious and accurates, has often deplorably thin, reedy, high
                        notes. Her lower and middle notes are charming, but the rest are trying
                        Signor Tschierdo went completely to pieces through overwork ; and Signor
                        Battani--it was pathetic when one remembered the exquisite voice we had
                        heard in the summer of 1906, and contrasted it with what he now is : harsh
                        and cracked, singing with manifest effort. Except for a note now and again
                        all the beauty had left his voice-- again overwork and the evil climate are
                        to blame. Signor Valls, who has a really fine voice, only appeared once or
                        twice. Signor Lucenti was the mainstay and real delight of the whole
                        company. His reading of Mefistofele is remarkable. One can hardly see how it
                        could be surpassed As Ramfis, as Mefistofeles in "Faust," as Alviso in
                        "Gioconda," in his one appearance in "Bohème," wherever he appeared, he was
                        splendid He is one of the three or four best, if not the best singer we have
                        had in Egypt this season. Signori Arrighetti and Pompa have both improved to
                        a great extent. Their voices are full and true and pleasing in tone. Signora
                        Orbellini was charming as Tosca and very good in almost all she did, and
                        Signora Fassini was delightful. Her voice has great depth and fullness, and
                        yet" is soft and sympathetic. Her dance in "Carmen" was purely fascinating
                        Signora Mastropasqua always looked attractive, and sang prettily though her
                        voice is rather light for such parts as Gilda. The rest were fair at times,
                        but not always very sympathetic or tuneful. Signora Garagnani is better than
                        most "utility" sopranos. She has plenty of voice, rather hard at times, but
                        always true, and her acting is quite good. Of the chorus, the male voices
                        were decent enough, the rest.very poor; when under Signor Campanini's eye!
                        they sang well ; but the singing behind the scenes usually resulted in
                        collapse. The orchestra are fair as musicians, but careless. They do not
                        always time their instruments well ; and to this the conductor ought to have
                        seen. Signor Ricci was hardly forcible enough for them ; he was too
                        painstaking and pei haps even-tempered. Signor Campanini was very different
                        to him and to inost conductors we have had here. He was remarkable at times,
                        and transformed orchestra, chorus, and singers; he seemed to be able to do
                        anything with them. To watch his baton and his hands alone was the keenest
                        pleasure. He and Lucenti between them did not merely save Mefistofele : they
                        made it memorable. His reading of the 3rd act of "Tosca," or "Aida," of some
                        parts of "Faust" was unusually a mirable : he is the son of the famous
                        Campanini and if he continues and enhances the promise he gives now, he
                        should be famous himself. The one important omission was the "Huguenots"--a
                        great, pity as Valls and Lucenti would both have sung in it. On the whole
                        the fine performances amply made up for the failures, and were a real relief
                        and contrast to the trying and uneven efforts of the Khedivial Theatre. If
                        the management had only secured another and a really good soprano, and had
                        not overworked their light tenors, and-more especially--had selected a good
                        chorus of sopranos and altos, the whole programme might have been as
                        brilliant a success as were its best iteins. The receipts should have been
                        good enough to warrant this, as there were often crowded houses. We must
                        hope for their reappearance and that they will have introduced some such
                        improvements. Signor Lucenti is, it seems, coming here next year. Let us
                        trust the rest will be worthy of him. </p>

                    <head>FINAL ROUND.</head>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the markers' billiard tournament had already been won
                        by Percy by his two victories at Shepheard's and one at Ghezireh Palace, the
                        interest shown in the final round, which was played at the Grand Continental
                        Hotel on Wednesday night, Syer being "at home" to Percy and Flowers, was
                        keeper t' an ever, for Syer's many supporters looked forward to him taking
                        ample revenge for his defeats by his two opponents on their own tables. </p>
                    <p>On this occasion the billiard saloon of the Continental was excellently
                        filled, and at 9.80 p.m. Syer and Percy commenced their match. Almost
                        immediately after the opening Syer got ahead of his opponent, to whom, it
                        must be remembered, he coucerled 50, by steady play and a very pretty break
                        of 34, and though Percy at times looked like drawing level with him, he kept
                        a good lead throughout. In the course of the game Syer gave several pretty
                        exhibitions, including breaks of 23, 28, 21 (all off the red), 26, and ran
                        out with a splendid 43 unfinished, which he continued in response to the
                        general demand, and only broke down very unluckily at 84. Percy's play was
                        steady throughout and showed much thoroughness, while his principal breaks
                        were 28, 21, and 28. The game lasted an hour and ten minutes, the final
                        score being Syer, 800 ; Percy (received 50), 226. </p>
                    <p>After the customary collection had been made for the benefit of the hotel
                        markers by Mr Bernie Mansfield (and, we are glad to note, with more handsome
                        results than ever) Syer and Flowers commenced the final match, by Flowers
                        playing a safety miss into baulk. Two more safety misses followed and Syer
                        then made a good break of 26 from a pretty cannou off the red off three
                        cushions. This he speedily followed with a very neatly compiled 50, and he
                        good overtook his opponent, who had received a start of 75. Though doing
                        nothing brilliant, however, Flowers kept on playing some very neat shots and
                        by a series of small breaks kept within measurable distance of Syer The
                        latter broke down rather badly once or twice, but, besides the breaks
                        already mentioned, he put together 24, 28, 35, and 28 and gained the victory
                        by 58, the final scores being 300-242. Play in this game lasted 55 minutes. </p>

                    <head>BRITISH CONTROL OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <head>THE MORAL RETROGRESSION. </head>
                    <p>By John M. ROBERTSON, M.P. That moral life is going back in Egypt, while the
                        material life is going forward, lies on the face of the official reports.
                        Year after year it is announced that the increase in revenue is accompanied
                        by an increase of crime ; and in Lord Cromer's Report for 1905 there is
                        communicated the opinion of Captain Machell, the British " Adviser " to the
                        Ministry of the In. terior, that the increase of crime is the direct result
                        of the advancing prosperity Thus the British administration in Egypt is in
                        the piquant position of demanding gratitude from the Egyptian people for
                        having increased the national income, while affirming that that very
                        increase is the cause of national demoralisation. </p>
                    <p>I do not for a moment gay that Captain Machell's theory of the causation of
                        crime is sound. I met only one man in Egypt in e month who subscribed to it;
                        and the British officials are as little satisfied with it as the Egyptians.
                        In no other country, I fancy, has such a theory ever been put forward. But
                        it holds the ground as the official theory for the time being ; and it
                        entitles every Egyptian Nationalist to say : " So be it : if the prosperity
                        you claim to have caused be the source of our moral retrogression, you had
                        better clear out and let us revert to honest poverty. And you will be good
                        enough, in the circumstances, to dispense with our gratitude." Were a father
                        to say to his son : " I have given you a large income and enabled you to
                        live in luxury : it.. is your own fault if, living in tutelage, you have
                        grown vicious," he would not generally be held to have a strong case. </p>
                    <p>SERVILITY - ENCOURAGED.</p>
                    <p>What the British Control has done for Egypt, on the side of the moral and
                        intellectual life, is to upset and deracinate the old social and political
                        organisation without substituting any. thing equally efficient and, above
                        all, without giving any such popular instruction as shall | put the people
                        upon the way of healthy self government on new lines. In the old days, the
                        omdeh or headman of every village was chosen by the people ; and under that
                        system crime </p>
                    <p>was checked by the feudal or quasi-patriarchal power with which he was
                        invested. By the admission of Captain Machell, the British Control during a
                        number of years pursued the policy of disregarding the feudal spirit of the
                        people, with bad results. The excuse was that the feudal method involved
                        feuds; and the idea was to appoint men of less weight on the score that they
                        did not represent a faction. To this it should be added that the constant
                        tendency of the British Administration, despite the bias of its best men, is
                        to insist upon and develop servility in all natives to whom it gives
                        appointments; and that every sign of self respect and independence on the
                        part of village headmen or mudirs (governors of provinces) is officially
                        represented --if not by the chief authorities then by the majority of the
                        inspectors, </p>
                    <p>The outcome is that while we in Britain boast of our racial conservatism as
                        having made us wisely slow to upset old usages -- in contrast with the rash
                        French, who so readily "break with the past"—in Egypt, as elsewhere, we have
                        played skittles with the oldest institutions and the most important social
                        relations. What we consider risky for ourselves we force upon less advanced
                        communities without scruple, though in their case all sudden and sweeping
                        change is obviously more hazardous. The result is a noticeable increase of
                        criminality in certain provinces. The crimes on the increase are mainly
                        those of personal malice and retaliation ; and one of the causes would
                        certainly appear to be the lowering of the status of omdehs by the method of
                        selection latterly pursued. Where the headman is seen to be of no account,
                        primitive crime grows bold There are, of course, other cases. In some
                        districts the reclamation of land involves 1 the expulsion of Bedouin
                        "squatters, who revenge themselves as best they can. It is certain that
                        really good inspectors--men with a gift of conciliation can do, and have
                        done, much to end old feuds. But the official figures tell of a general or
                        frequent failure to cope with the evil ; and there is no prospect whatever
                        of an improvement. </p>
                    <p>It is admitted that even now a really capable o ndeh can keep his village
                        nearly free of |irimo The Administration protest that their difficulty is
                        precisely that of finding good men. </p>
                    <p>The answer is that their attitude towards independent men loges thom thg
                        service of many of the best that their arbitrary methods of appointment can
                        succeed only by accident ; and that finally, they will not take the right
                        way to increase the number of instructed and competent men in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>EDUCATIONAL NEEDS.</p>
                    <p>To raise the levels of social life, two things are required -- the better
                        instruction of all classes of natives, and the enlistment of all classes to
                        some extent in the cause of better government. Ia neither of these
                        directions does the Administration make any general advance. Something is
                        done for education in the way of providing new kuttabs, or elementary
                        schools (mostly built by native notables), and in the development of primary

                        be worked. But there is needed a great national system of popular education
                        to overtake the enormous mass of illiteracy, and an enlightened system of

                    <p>One of the grounds on which popular education has been restricted in the past

                        faces educationists at home. But to fall back on a policy of inaction is no
                        solution, The way to prevent elementary education from multiplying harmfully
                        the competitors for clerkships is to make it so general that it is no
                        special qualification ? </p>
                    <p>The answer is that their attitude towards independent men loges thom thg
                        service of many of the best that their arbitrary methods of appointment can
                        succeed only by accident ; and that finally, they will not take the right
                        way to increase the number of instructed and competent men in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. </p>
                    <p>To raise the levels of social life, two things are required -- the better
                        instruction of all classes of natives, and the enlistment of all classes to
                        some extent in the cause of better government. Ia neither of these
                        directions does the Administration make any general advance. Something is
                        done for education in the way of providing new kuttabs, or elementary
                        schools (mostly built by native notables), and in the development of primary
                        and secondary Government schools. One entirely hopeful feature is the
                        creation of schools for girls, and the beginning of a system of training
                        native female teachers for these. Should this movement continue, wonders may

                    <head>EGYPTIAN NATIONALISM,</head>
                    <p>Mr. Edward Dicey has published an article in the "Daily Telegraph" in which
                        he ridicules Mr. J M. Robertson's efforts and calls him a well meaning
                        doctrinaire. He shows that the less Parliament takes up the Egyptian
                        Question the better for all concerned Mr. Dicey attacks Mustapha Kamel
                        Pasha,charging him with wishing to restore Turkish supremacy in Egypt. " The
                        Egyptian Standard," continues Mr. Dicey, will prove a dead failure. </p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Standard" comments on Mr. Dicey's article under the heading "Mr
                        Dicey's Relapse," as though he were guilty of apostasy. Mustapha Pasha
                        Kamel's organ remarks :- </p>
                    <p>It is (we think) almost equivalent to his repentance for having written some
                        of the most able chapters in his book on "The Egypt of the Future"-it can
                        carry but little weight. Had his opinions concerning our Director's desires
                        to restore Turkish supremacy been written a month ago when "Al Lewa" was the
                        only National organ and could not deny in broad English false accusations
                        brought against it, some importance might have been attached to Mr. Dicey's
                        statements. But to-day 1. They are behind the times and unimportant The
                        National party is simply and solely fighting for the liberty, the self
                        government in Egypt, the keeping of those promises made by England and which
                        have not been kept.It wishes Egypt to be the free friend of Europe and not
                        the oppressed vassal slave. Does that signify that it is the National
                        Party's desire to restore Turkish supremacy ? It does signify that the
                        National Party's aim is to restore to Egypt, Funder a constitutional form,
                        her old liberty, existing prior to the coming of the English and French. As
                        regards the financial control of Egypt as long as she is in debt to Europe.
                        Our Director accepted an international control in a previous issue of the "
                        Egyptian Standard," so that this matter would not create a scare among
                        fearing stock-brokers, capitalists and bond-holders. </p>

                    <p>The following is the conclusion of Mr. Dicey's article in the "Daily
                        Telegraph," the first part of which was published in our issue of yesterday
                        :-- </p>
                    <p>There upon negotiations were entered into between the Khedivial Government,
                        which owns all unoccupied desert land in Egypt, and MM. Boghos Pa-ha Nubar
                        and Empain, which resulted in the following arrangement : The Government
                        agreed to cede the promoters of the Oasis City scheme. 6,000 acres of desert
                        land, distant about five miles east of Cairo, adjoining the track of the old
                        Cairo to Suez Railway, which had been abandoned aş uşeleg after the
                        completion of the Suez canal. The land thus ceded was given for an almost
                        normal price, subject to the conditions that the city should be erected in a
                        block of 1,000 acres, while the remaining 5,000 were never to be built upon,
                        so as to gecure for perpetuity an open space between the old and the new
                        Cairo. There was no dispute as to the site of the Oasis City. The desert of
                        Suez does not border any. where on the Nile, and the ground riser gradually
                        from the baņks of the river till it reaches the crest of a row of sandhills,
                        which look to me as if they were spurs of the Mokattam Range, over-hanging
                        the citadel of Cairo. The time had now arrived to settle the plans and
                        dimensions of the Oasis City. It was then that M. Empain's marvellous genius
                        as an organiser of great enterprises came into play. </p>
                    <p>My impression, from what I have heard, is that at the outset the idea had
                        been to build a certain limited number of houses at Oasis City. and to
                        ascertain whether there was sufficient demand for such dwellings at so great
                        a distance from the business quarters and the public offices of Cairo. M.
                        Empain, however, contended that an experiment of this kind would be
                        insufficient, that the construction of a number of specimen villas would
                        require a stafi of engineers, architects, builders, experts in irrigation,
                        roadmakers, and railway constructors of almost equal numbers to those
                        required to construct the whole city ; that in the long run the outlay would
                        be infinitely less onerous if the new city was constructed in parts, instead
                        of as one big job; and that tenants would not be found to take houses in a
                        barren desert till they were provided with waterworks, roads, tramways, and
                        electric railways, and all the "amenities," to use a Scotch phrase, of a
                        civilised city. The force of M. Empain's arguments, and I suspect even more
                        the extraordinary vigour of his individuality, carried the day ; his
                        fellow-promoters not only followed his advice, but threw themselves heart
                        and soul into his project. In the early part of last year the prospectus of
                        the Oasis City Company was issued in Egypt, and the demand for shares was 90
                        great that before the application list was closed the £1 shares bad risen to
                        a premium of between $3 and £4, at which figure they still stand. </p>
                    <p>The causes of this unwonted demand were of various character. The first was
                        the composition of the board, which, unlike most of the companies placed on
                        the Egyptian market, was, with very few exceptions, composed of men who,
                        whether English, Belgian, or Egyptian, were all known and respected in Egypt
                        both by natives and foreigners. Then the fact of Boghos Pasha having been
                        the originator of the Oasis City project told strongly with the Egyptian
                        public on account not only of his name and wealth, but of the high character
                        he holds as a man of sound judgment, great commonsense, a large and
                        successful landowner, and the last person likely to risk his own fortune and
                        that of his friends in any speculative enterprise of whose success he was
                        not well assured. Moreover, it was manifest that if men of such great
                        experience as his Excellency Boghos Pasha Nubar, M. Empain, and M Carton de
                        Wiart, the leading advocate of the Egyptian Bar, had associated their names
                        with the construction of a new suburb of Cairo in the desert of Suez, it
                        followed that in their judgment the present demand for building sites and
                        for residential houses within Cairo proper was likely to remain
                        substantially on its present scale for many years to come. This indirect
                        testimony to the probable continuance of the boom was naturally very
                        acceptable to the promoters of the various 'companies with which the Cairene
                        and Alexandrian markets have been flooded during the last two years, and
                        this may have accounted for the extraordinary number of applications for
                        shares and to the high premium the shares reached on allotment. GOOD ROADS
                        AND EXPRESS TRAMS. </p>
                    <p>In order to realise the greatness of the task taken in hand by the syndicate
                        who underwrote the Oasis City Company, it is necessary to appreciate the
                        initial difficulties with which they had to contend They had not only to
                        construct a township of comfortable houses and Aats, covering an area of
                        1,000 acres, and to find tenants at a moderate rental, but they had to
                        provide cheap and rapid modes of transit between Cairo and its new suburb,
                        to supply each tenement with gardens, water, and electricity, to place them
                        apart at a distance which would secure a current of fresh air, and to do all
                        this in conformity with the somewhat arbitrary regulations imposed upon them
                        by the Egyptian Góvernment and the British authorities. What they have
                        already accomplished is absolutely marvellous. If you visit the embryo city
                        of the desert and use your eyes you need no imagination to judge for
                        yourself what the new Cairo of the s burbs will look like when finally
                        completed. Good, hard, macadamised roads have been constructed in every
                        direction, over which you can walk, or Hide, or drive, cither by ourriaga or
                        motor, as rapidly and as smoothly as you can along the highways of England
                        of France; there is in course of construction a network of electric
                        tramways, 80 contrived as to communicate with the Cairo Electrio Tramcar
                        Company, of which M. Empain is, I believe, the chairman, and by which any
                        passenger can travel from the Oasis City to any part of Cairo without change
                        of carriages </p>
                    <p>There is to be a direct tramline worked by electricity, which is to convey
                        passengers from the Oasis city to the Cairo terminus in under ten minutes.
                        An enormous hotel is being built. The first three of its four storeys, which
                        will contain 300 bed-rooms, have been already completed, and will be open by
                        the commencement of next season. A very considerable number of plots in the
                        Oasis City have already been applied for, and most of these plots are now
                        being comtr icted by the company. The spectacle of the roads, railroads,
                        tramways, buildings, houses, offices, now in course of construction, when I
                        revisited the spot during the present week, recalled to my mind one of the
                        sights in which I have always taken the strongest interest, that of an ant
                        hill being built up or repaired by a swarm of ante. Looking down from the
                        brow of the band ridge, on which the Oasis City is to stand, the 8,000
                        labourers, mostly fellaheen, seemed to me, as seen from a distance, like a
                        multitude of insects struggling blindly in every direction, and yet, as you
                        watched them carefully from afar, bringing order out of chaos and working
                        together with a common purpose to bring about a common end. </p>
                    <p>AN EASTERN PICTURE.</p>
                    <p>I confess, however that my attention was more or legs attracted from the
                        progress of the builders and workers by the unexpected beauty of the view,
                        as seen from the ridge, which is to form the foreground, if I may use the
                        woods of the Oasis City. I have always, ever since I first visited Cairo,
                        thought the view of the Nile Valley, as seen from the citadel, to be one of
                        the niost beautiful I have ever witnessed in any country of the world. I
                        confess, however, the view of Cairo and of the Pyramids and of the Delta as
                        seen from the Suez desert surrounding the Oasis City, rivals in my
                        estimation the view from the citadel. It so happened that I was there when
                        the sun was sinking in the west, and Cairo, Ghezireh, and the Pyramids
                        themselves were all lighted up by one of those gorgeous masses of shifting
                        colour which are only to be witnessed in the East. Somehow it added, to my
                        thinking, to the Oriental character of the scene, on which gazed, to notice
                        that as the hour of prayer approached with the setting sun, workman after
                        workman dropped out of the serried ranks labouring at the foot of the ridge
                        on which I stood, knelt down, bowed his head to the ground, and repeated the
                        prayer of Islam, that there is one God, and that Mahomet is his prophet </p>
                    <p>I am not an optimist by disposition, and, even if I had any reason for
                        expressing an opinion as to the financial prospects of the Dasis City, I
                        should distrist the value of my own opinion. This much, however, I can
                        fairly say, that the air of the desert suburb is infinitely dryer and
                        fresher than that of Cairo itself, or of Ghezireh. I cannot but think that
                        visitors who come to Egypt to avoid cold and Wet and fog will do wisely if
                        they take up their abode in the Oasis City socmer than remain in Jiiro,
                        especially if it is to be pulled to pieces in order to inaugurate a system
                        of water drainage Moreover, I am certain that in one respect at any rate
                        Cairo will have reason to be thankful to the founders of the Oasis City for
                        having removed one of the great defects of the capital of Egypt from a
                        foreigner's point of view ; that is, the almost total absence of roads.
                        Practically there is only one drive in Cairo, and that is the road to and
                        from the Pyramids, a distance of about nine kilometres, a road most
                        monotonous in itself, and mainly occupied by tramways. </p>
                    <p>The Oasis Company has already constructed an excellent carriage-road, passing
                        from the Matarieh Railway terminus in Cairo, by Zeitoun, Koubbeh, the
                        Khedive's Palace, the Virgin's Tree, and so on to Oasis City, and returning
                        thence to Cairo by the Abbassi-h suburb, a distance of sixteen kilometres.
                        The roads are Bo well constructed that they may be expected to remain in use
                        for many a year to come. </p>

                    <head>M. KOEHLER'S RECITAL.</head>
                    <p>M. Heinrich Koehler gave a piano concert at the Savoy Hotel on Tuesday
                        afternoon He played some interesting music and showed considerable technique
                        and knowledge, but his interpretation is almost too conscientious to be
                        pleasing : he is too matter of fact and even monotonous at times. The
                        opening piece by Hummel and the Chopin Nocturne especially showed this He
                        minimised the perfect effect of flow in the latter and did not emphasize the
                        rhythm sufficiently. The Beethoven Andante was much better, as the player
                        seemed to be more in sympathy with the piece. The | Mendelssohn Rondo was
                        good, but it is not profoundly impressive, and much of it is rather
                        colourless. The one piece Mr. Koehler played really well was the Finale de
                        la Walkurie. This his own arrangement for piano, I understand is an
                        admirable and delightful piece, instinct with colour and great breadth and
                        variety. He brought out all its beauty and gave to the full the continuous
                        tone which characterised it. Ono part-an effect for violins-was delightful
                        though all too short, and he did full justice to it. The rest was fair but
                        showed the same tendency to apathy and even depression as the Huminel. Mr.
                        Koehler is, however, a sound musician and a good pianist. The fire and
                        temperament which he showed in the "Walkurie' would probably have been
                        called forth more fully in a selection of somewhat more emphatic music than
                        that of his programme. </p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        Bre fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. </p>

                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, aid possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than any other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to On leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some
                            will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                            sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each
                            of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. </p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co's steamers,
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            m chto interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic renmates that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in BC 212, when Archimedes was slain--his tomb is to be seen.
                            The cathedral was once an ancient pas au temple. PALERMO, with about
                            300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city he
                            Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                            Giovannia degli Erimiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                            Museum Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                            visit. </p>

                            takes you to Sorrento (you can drive too] will take you on to Capri. </p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours All who can will
                            devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                            portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well
                            known to need comment here. </p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where all other week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excurssions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade. In Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallum brosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from. Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view </p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset. </p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO, One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>- The most I picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with the record

                            phenomenally equable temperature- warm in winter and deliciously cool
                            breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer. </p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes and paintings, are
                            a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in
                            Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble calumns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santa filled with its wonderful tombs. </p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail. </p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit. </p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and-a-half from Milan is

                            <p>The steamers of the P &amp; O, North German Lloyd, Orient, and
                                Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The anchor, British India,
                                Bibby and Henderson Lines, are also excellent, and their steamers
                                are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt. As regards the train
                                journeys from Cairo the shortest is that to Alex: Indria, without
                                change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                                in 4 ½ hours. The least expensive way to England is hy the Moss,
                                Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to
                                Liverpool. The German Levant liners also good steamers from
                                Alexandria to Hamburg. </p>

                                delightful places imaginable to pass &amp; quiet stay. The total
                                absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse,
                                cart, carriage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound
                                of life at. every turn. The approach the Venice from the Adriatic is
                                unlike that of any other seaport. The town seems to be gradually,
                                like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of
                                rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the horizon,
                                then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                                of the calm lagoon. Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of
                                the beautiful Italian lakes. COMO, the birthplace of the younger
                                Pliny, is reached in olie-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of
                                Monza: Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake,
                                which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the
                                lake is most enchanting CERNOBBIO is a charming spot.; then come
                                Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town
                                of Bellaggio- opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of

                                reached by train in one-and-a-half hours It has a population of

                                resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the town, is
                                worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                                by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion. LUCERNE—A
