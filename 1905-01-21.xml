                    <head>RABIES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The prevalence of rabies and the methods to be employed for its prevention
                        are burning questions in Egypt to-day. For some years past the number of
                        cases of rabies in dogs and of hydrophobia in man in this country has shown
                        an alarming increase; but the Egyptian Government has not, up to the
                        present, adopted any active measures for dealing with the evil. Lord Cromer,
                        in his last report, touched, indeed, upon the subject; only, however, to
                        point out that the time for enforcing the usual remedies was not yet ripe.
                        Whether the real difficulty lies in the financial aspect of the question, or
                        in the suggested danger of native opposition, or in the difficulties
                        connected with the Capitulations, the need for action is none the less
                        pressing; and it is to be hoped that the public will, before long, be
                        induced to recognise the seriousness of the situation and be stimulated to
                        insist upon official interference for its amelioration. An impressive object
                        lesson to the casual observer is the grim pro cession of 'tumbrils' that
                        pass daily along the Sharia Kasr-el-Aini, Cairo, containing the dog bitten
                        victims who are sent from the Government Hospital for inoculation at the
                        Anti-Rabic Institute. These often number as many as forty or fifty persons
                        in one day, and although there is no proof that they have been all bitten by
                        mad dogs, the presumptive evidence to this effect is very strong, when it is
                        considered that the natives are not lovers of dogs and rarely treat them in
                        the light of pets, and that the common native dog, when sane, does not
                        incline to attack people but rather to slink out of their way. Happily, the
                        annual death rate from hydrophobia bears a small ratio to the number of
                        persons bitten by undoubtedly rabid dogs; this must be ascribed to the wise
                        rule which requires that all cases of dog-bites among the natives shall be
                        treated at once with a course of anti-rabic inoculations extending over a
                        period of three weeks. In this connection the following statistics, showing
                        the enormous reduction in the mortality effected by the introduction of the
                        Pasteur treatment, may be found of interest In England Sir Victor Horsley
                        gave the mortality of all cases bitten by rabid animals, not treated by
                        inoculation, as 15%; a more general concensus of opinion places it at 16%.
                        In Paris, for the first fourteen years after its inauguration (i.e., 1886 to
                        1899 inclusive), the statistics of the Pasteur Institute showed an average
                        mortality of 0.41(+)%; for the years 1895-99 a mortality of 0.29(+)%. It
                        will thus be seen that the average mortality has been reduced more than
                        fiftyfold by the adoption of the Pasteur treatment.</p>
                    <p>Excellent, however, as may be the results of inoculation after the bite, a
                        considerable economy would be effected by the employment in Egypt of some,
                        at least, of the prophylactic measures which have successfully ridden other
                        countries of the scourge. In England, for example, 668 dogs were killed as
                        rabid in 1895, and there were 20 deaths from hydrophobia. In April, 1897, a
                        general muzzling order, was brought int force and continued for six months
                        after the last case had been notified: all stray dogs were destroyed. In the
                        spring of 1899. the disease had disappeared, except in one part of Wales;
                        the the muzzling order<cb n="6"/> was consequently relaxed in October, 1899,
                        save in the area above-mentioned. It was relaxed there also in May, 1900, no
                        case having occurred since the preceding November. In the summer it
                        reappeared, and muzzling was again enforced in Wales. In December, 1901,
                        Great Britain was officially declared free of the disease. To avoid a
                        recrudescence, the importation of dogs into the United Kingdom is now
                        prohibited; it is more or less generally accepted that rabies can only be
                        transmitted by inoculation, and that, although the incubation period may
                        even extend over a year, the disease cannot arise de novo: thus, by the
                        exclusion of foreign dogs, England continues to be free from rabies.</p>
                    <p>Taking into account the prejudices and fatalism of an Oriental race, and the
                        topography of Egypt, it is obvious that such a thorough prophylactic cannot
                        be enforced in its entirety. Certain measures, however, suggest themselves
                        as practicable. 1. Compulsory enregistration of all dogs and cats. Each
                        animal to wear a collar of regulation pattern bearing the owner's name and
                        address and the registration number in European and Arabic characters; 2.
                        Muzzling to be enforced in all large towns and in the villages wherever
                        possible; 3. The enforcement of a licence to accompany the registration
                        number. The fee for this should be relatively high, to discourage the
                        maintenance of hordes of so-called watch-dogs. (It is among this class that
                        rabies is particularly rife). The list of owners to be properly inspected
                        and controlled; the non-payment of the fee to be punished by fine, or
                        confiscation and destruction of the animal; 4. Importation of dogs or cats
                        to be prohibited; 5. The destruction of all stray dogs and cats. All animals
                        without a collar to be killed at once : all dogs in towns or villages,
                        without a muzzle, but with a collar and registration number, to be lassoed
                        and taken to a depot. In the latter case the owner to be informed and fined
                        on his claiming the dog or cat; the animal, if unclaimed, to be killed after
                        the lapse of a reasonable period. For this purpose properly controlled
                        lethal chambers should be established.</p>
                    <p>For the destruction of pariahs some more efficient system than that now
                        practised is necessary. At present, notice is given from time to time that
                        the police will poison all stray dogs found in a certain quarter on a
                        certain night. At best, this is but a cruel and an ineffectual method;
                        pariahs wander by day, at night they retire to holes and other shelters to
                        sleep. It might be considered expedient to offer a reward for the body of
                        every pariah brought to the authorities. It may be objected that this would
                        result in an anarchistic campaign by the lowest native population; that an
                        armed rabble would prowl round the houses at night in order to destroy any
                        animals to be found, and that the lives of the owners would be endangered by
                        flying bullets; that pariahs would be bred in numbers for the sake of the
                        reward; moreover, that it is the European dogs which are mainly responsible
                        for the spread of hydrophobia. While it is, perhaps, true that European dogs
                        bite more people than do pariahs, upon investigation it usually transpires
                        that the dog in question was inoculated in the first place by a pariah; the
                        latter are undoubtedly responsible for the propagation of rabies. Of the two
                        evils to be reckoned with, the presence of pariahs in the neighbourhood of
                        towns, and particularly of slaughter-houses, would appear to constitute a
                        graver danger than any that might result from measures taken for their
                        extermination. It would always be easy to institute special measures for the
                        protection of private foreign dogs.</p>
                    <p>Without entering into details, a few points are to be noted with regard to
                        the symptoms of rabies in dogs. A. In canine rabies there is usually no
                        'hydrophobia,' as is the case with man; a dog may be able to eat and drink
                        throughout the whole course of the disease. In fact, excessive thirst is, as
                        a rule, a prominent symptom. B. 15 to 20% of all cases of rabies in dogs are
                        of the 'dumb' variety, when the animal passes directly into the third or
                        paralytic stage without displaying the signs of fury characteristic of the
                        second stage, although the dog shows no inclination to bite, and is
                        generally unable to do so owing to paresis of the jaw and throat muscles,
                        the saliva is, nevertheless, intensely virulent; any accidental
                        inoculation-as from a scratch or sore on the hand used in making an
                        examination-is consequently as dangerous as the most severe bite. C. All
                        animals bitten by a suspected dog should be secured and isolated, and, if
                        the dog be proved mad, they should be destroyed. If compatible with public
                        safety the suspected animal should not be immediately killed, but secured
                        and sent to an institute tor observation. If killed, the brain and spinal
                        cord should be removed and sent, in clean glycerine, to the nearest
                        institute for diagnosis. On receiving a bite from a mad dog, in the event of
                        the absence of immediate medical assistance, a ligature should be improvised
                        from a piece of string or bootlace, if the bite is on a finger; or from a
                        handkerchief, tightened by twisting it by means of a stick or rod, if the
                        bite is on the arm or leg The wound should then be thoroughly cauterised. It
                        is essential that the caustic touch all parts of the wound, which should be
                        enlarged, if necessary, by means of a sharp, clean knife. Probably the best
                        caustic is pure carbolic acid, applied thoroughly by means of a swab on the
                        end of a small stick. This to be followed immediately by the application of
                        alcohol (methylated spirit). A hot wire is also effectual. After cauterising
                        the ligature should be removed. No time should be lost in under going
                        treatment at an anti-rabic institute. Precautions after the event are,
                        however, but a poor makeshift for our preservation from the Iread disease.
                        It is urgently to be hoped that the Egyptian Government will see its way, in
                        the near future, to taking steps to stamp out the pest ere it assumes the
                        graver form of a general epizootio,</p>

                                gåve rise to wild rumours to the effect that the affair was the
                                outcome of a military plot. The men of the saluting battery have
                                been arrested. (Reuter.)</p>

                        was more successful, if possible, than any of its predecessors.</p>

                        modifications qu'il jugera nécessaires dans la suite. La question est
                        capitale, et nous ne savous pas si les Puissances n'apporteront pas
                        certaines restrictions à leur consentement, car, ainsi que le fait justement
                        observer un de nos contrères, la liberté accordée au gouvernement égyptien
                        sera l'acheminement à la suppression des tribunaux consulaires par
                        l'attribution de la compétence pénale aux tribunaux mixtes. Les agents
                        diplomatiques, qui prévoient cette éventualité, tiennent-ils au maintien des

                    <p>The annual ball given by this flourishing institution took place on Thursday
                        night, and passed off with great éclat. The ball-room was lit with arc lamps
                        and small colored incandescent lamps festooned from the centre to the sides,
                        the latter producing a very pretty effect. The verandah was covered with
                        native tentwork, and its spacious proportions made it almost a room of
                        itself. The band occupied a dais in the billiard-room. From 9 o'clock until
                        the early hours of the morning a constant stream of guests arrived, among
                        whom we may mention Major and Mrs. L'Estrange Johnstone, Major Le Breton,
                        Mr. and Mrs. A. S. Peckitt, Mr. and Mrs. Sheppard, Mr. and Mrs. Goyder, Mr.

                        by all the members of the committee of the institute. Letters of regret were
                        sent by many who were unable to attend, but spite of this some 500 were
                        present, the scene being a very gay and animated one; the only regret

                    <p>The success attending the ball was a strong proof, if any were needed, of the

                    <p>The engine-room of the electric lighting station here has been destroyed by

                        and the Grand Hotels. Owing to the vicinity of the Cataract Hotel to the
                        scene of the fire, many of the visitors were able to render invaluable
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>No inconvenience has been caused to the hotels, which are at present lighted
                        with oil lamps and candles. It is expected that the installation will be in
                        working order in a day or two.</p>

                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Egyptian Salt and
                        Soda Company, Limited, was held on Thursday, January 12, at the registered
                        office of the company, 6, Old Jewry, London, E. C., Mr. A. Turner presiding.
                        The Secretary (Mr. Henry J. Humm) read the notice convening the meeting. The
                        Chairman then made the following remarks:-</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen,-In the absence of Sir Elwin Palmer, the chairman of the company,
                        who is detained in Egypt, I have been asked to put before you and propose
                        the special resolution which is submitted to you to-day. The modifications
                        that are proposed in the statute, as you will observe, with two exceptions,
                        are justified by the fact that it is considered desirable that the whole
                        business and affairs of a company such as the Egyptian Salt and Soda Company
                        should be entirely managed, directed and carried on in Egypt exclusively,
                        and that the headquarters should be in Cairo. I trust you will agree with
                        this view and give your vote in favor of these modifica tions. As regards
                        the two exceptions that are mentioned, one refers to directors' fees, which
                        it is proposed to reduce, and I can hardly imagine that you, as
                        shareholders, will have any objection to that. The other exception gives the
                        right to bearer shares to vote by proxy, and considering the fact that a
                        very large majority of the shares are bearer shares, it would seem only fair
                        that some modification of the statute, permitting them to vote at meetings
                        by proxy, should be passed. The directors have no proposal to make to-day
                        with regard to the amalgamation with the Huileries and Savonneries Company,
                        as there are still matters of detail to be settled. I may, however, say that
                        we have come to very satisfactory terms with that company, and before long
                        we expect to be in a position to have everything in order and to submit a
                        proposal to you for an increase of capital to enable us to carry out the
                        amalgamation. The principle of the amalgamation was, as you are aware,
                        approved at the extraordinary general meeting held in September last, and
                        cannot, I think, fail to be most beneficial to the company in the future. I
                        do not think it is necessary for me to say anything further. There is
                        nothing that arises particularly from these alterations of the articles of
                        association other than I have referred to in general terms, and if no share-
                        holder has any special remark to make I will propose the resolution that the
                        articles of association be altered as follows. [The alterations have already
                        been given in full in our advertisement columns in the notice convening this
                        meeting so we need not give the details of the resolution, which was
                        seconded by Mr. E. Debourg, and carried unanimously without comment.]</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then said :- I need not keep you any longer, but you will
                        observe from the notice that a confirmatory meeting will be held here on
                        January 27, 1905, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
                    <p>The meeting closed vith the usual vote of thanks.</p>

                    <p>Rigoletto was very well given at the Verdi Theatre, Cairo, on Thursday night.
                        It was, above all, a triumph for Signor: Tomisani and Badini. Signora
                        Svicher was, needless to say, delightful as ever, and her rendering of the
                        aria displayed all that charm and skill with which we now associate her.
                        Signor Tomisani is certainly as good a light tenor as one can wish to hear,
                        and he was at his very best, except for two notes in which he was flat; but
                        one can easily forgive that when set against the rest of his singing. Signor
                        Badini was most forcible and dramatic, and in excellent voice.</p>
                    <p>We hear that La Boheme and also Mignon will be given before the company's

                        Department.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Everett, who has lately come out from England for service with the Sudan
                        Government, is at present at Railhead assisting Mr. George in erecting
                        telegraphs and telephones on the main Suakin-Atbara line.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Urquhart, the contractor for bridges for the Suakin-Atbara Railway, has
                        started erecting the first iron bridge of 106 feet span at Hambok station,
                        kilometer 31, and is making great progress with the work.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Vincent, agent for Mr. Urquhart, has lately arrived from Massowah, where
                        he was engaged in securing the services of several Italians and Abbysinians
                        as quarrymen, masons, miners, etc. They are all now at Hambok, where a large
                        camp has been formed of tents, wooden huts, etc.</p>
                    <p>All the land through which the line runs is very fertile at present. Melons
                        are abundant, and the plains are full of acacia trees. In fact, there are
                        forests of trees through which the line passes. All this is what nature has
                        brought about with simple showers of rain during a few months of the year,
                        but if this land had proper irrigation it would be more productive than some
                        lands in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that the visit of Sir William Garstin to these regions will
                        result in his proposing an irrigation scheme, which would be beneficial not
                        only to the inhabitants but also the Government, and the population would
                        greatly increase in these parts if the now barren deserts were made to
                        "blossom as the rose.</p>

                        night included all that is musical in our city, but we must say that more
                        advertisement should have been given to the concert, so as to allow many

                        correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to permit -

                        <head>MR. MCGILLIVRAY.<lb/>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</head>
                        <p>Sir, I fail to see that your correspondent "A Shareholder" has made out a
                            sufficient case against "A Friend of Mac's" to justify his employment of
                            the expression "Save me from my triends." Mr. McGillivray's friend,
                            whoever he may be, did the right thing in exposing the poor tone
                            displayed in these attacks on that gentleman. The bad taste of alluding
                            to Mr. McGillivray as having held an obscure position in the Bank of
                            Scotland prior to his coming out here, and also the allusions to his
                            having entered the National Bank of Egypt in a very subordinate
                            position, are obvious. I do not doubt that the editor of the paper,
                            which has gained such notoriety by its personal attacks, thinks that he
                            is justified in looking down upon clerks. He, of course, was never a
                            clerk himself and never held an obscure position. The pertect polish of
                            his editorial and leading articles show that he has received the best
                            education that England can bestow, and therefore, I presume, he is
                            entitled to look down on bank clerks, who occupy "obscure positions."
                            But, assuming that the newspaper has good grounds for making such
                            attacks, the snobbishness of its methods of vituperation greatly
                            detracts from the force of the criticism. "A Friend of Mac's" was,
                            therefore, perfectly justified in stigmatising these unworthy methods of
                            local journalism and in pointing out that the object of these diatribes
                            has risen to his present position without extraneous aids of any sort or
                            kind. I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>Prince Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and Norway lunched at Mena House
                        yesterday. His Royal Highness was present at Thursday's ceremony of the
                        Mahmal and was also present at last night's State ball.</p>
                    <p>The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, who left Devonshire House on Thursday for
                        Marseilles, arrived there yesterday and embarked on the P. &amp; O.
                        "Macedonia" for Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The Maharajah of Kapurthata has retained rooms at the Ghezireh Plalace
                        Hotel.</p>
                    <p>Among the many members of the English nobility, who are shortly expected to
                        arrive in Egypt, are the Earl and Countess Howe, who are due on the 3rd
                        February.</p>
                    <p>Sir Ernest Cassel is due on the same date.</p>
                    <p>We are authorised to state on the best authority that there is no ground for
                        the recent sta tements that have been appearing of late in the local Press
                        to the effect that Sir William Willcocks had resigned his post of managing
                        director of the Daira Sanieh Company. Sir William has not resigned and has
                        no intention of doing so.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Auberon Herbert has left the Carlton Hotel, Bulkeley, and is now
                        quartered at the Tewfik Palace Hotel, Helouan, for the season.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. J. G. Riddle, American Diplomatic Agent, is giving a large dinner
                        party at the Savoy on Thursday next.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the death of his brother, General Arthur de Boulinière, who was
                        recently promoted to the command of the 7th Brigade of the French Army,
                        stationed at Vesoul, M. de la Boulinière was unable to be present at last
                        night's Khedivial ball, and Mme. de la Boulinière will hold no receptions
                        for some time to come. The deceased General had served with great
                        distinction in the Corps d'Armée stationed on the Eastern frontier of the
                        Republic, which are officered by the élite of the French commissioned ranks.
                        We offer our most respectful condolences to M. and Mme. de la Boulinière in
                        their bereavement.</p>
                    <p>We regret to state that Mr. Henry Barker, of Alexandria, has been seriously
                        indisposed the last few days. He is however rather better this morning,
                        having passed an easier night.</p>
                    <p>M. de Mirabeau, director of the Suez Canal Company, arrived at Cairo
                        yesterday afternoon from Ismailia and is staying at the Savoy Hotel.</p>
                    <p>The Savoy Restaurant presented a very fine "coup d'ouil" yesterday evening,
                        several special dinner parties having been given on the occasion of the
                        State ball. Amongst those dining we noticed Mme. de Weerth and a large
                        party, including Judge and Mrs. Tuck, Hon. Mr. Riddle, and Mr. Morgan. At
                        another table we saw Lady Clarke entertaining Mr. Tod, Mr. Higgins, Mrs.
                        Jay, and Baron Haeften. Mrs. Choremi had a party of 6. Lord and Lady Craven
                        dined with Mr. and Mrs. Bradley Martin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Faber have ordered a suite of rooms at the Savoy Hotel and are
                        arriving shortly.</p>
                    <p>M. Robert, son of the Secretary of the French Chamber of Commerce, is to be
                        transferred from the Agency of the Messageries Maritimes at Alexandria to an
                        important position at the Beyrout Agency of the Company. M. Robert will
                        leave for Syria on February 2.</p>
