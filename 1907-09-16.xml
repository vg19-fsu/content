                    <head>THE ETHIOPIAN RAILWAY QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>According to a report which appears in the "Debats" the difficulties
                        regarding the Ethiopian Railway have now been practically arranged. The
                        Paris journal states that the Negus is now ready to give his support to the
                        completion of the line on condition that the enterprise will cease to have
                        anything in common with the management or methods of the company at present
                        in liquidation. It suggests that the Prench Government should guarantee the
                        enterprise as the only sure means of bringing it to a successful issue.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="itali ">Débats</hi> considers that the main interest of France
                        in the Ethiopian question lies in the completion and working of the railway
                        from Jibuti to Addis Abeba. Certain financial interests endeavoured, it
                        says, to secure international control of the railway by inculcating the
                        opinion in France that England would not tolerate a French company and by
                        giving the impression in England that public opinion and the Government in
                        France were disposed to allow a company nominally international but
                        practically English to take possession of a line which is destined to make
                        Jibuti the outlet of all Southern Ethiopia. In order to inspire the French
                        public with the necessary resignation, it was stated that Menelek was also
                        desirous of giving the matter an international character. This network of
                        intrigue, as the <hi rend="itali ">Débats</hi> describes it, was first
                        broken through by the treaty of December 13, 1906, which formally recognized
                        the French character of the line from Jibuti to Addis Abeba. After this fact
                        had been estabished it was possible for the French envoy to remove the
                        opposition of the Negus; who could entertain no mistrust of France unless it
                        were systematically inspired by persons whose situation at Addis Abeba gave
                        rise to the belief that they were supporters of French interests.</p>

                            fall of a piece of wood which mortally struck the man, and which

                            Chapeltown, on September 1. The car was driven by the Princess, and
                            contained another lady and the chauffeur, and the spped was alleged to
                            have been twenty-five miles an hour. The Princess when charged with
                            travelling at this speed, expressed her sorrow if it were true. She
                            expressed the opinion that she was not going at the speed stated. They

                    <head>MANSOURAH STONING CASE.</head>
                    <p>The statements published in the Press rê the recent stoning of Jews attending
                        a funeral at Mansourah, are of a very grave character. The disturbance
                        appears to have been absolutely unprovoked by the victims of a cowardly act
                        of aggression and if the version published by some of our contemporaries is
                        accurate, the police officer showed a curious conception of his duties when
                        he released of the ringlenders in the distance without apparently taking
                        their names. The incident is an interesting commentary on the statement of
                        some of our contemporaries that there is no such thing as religious
                        fanaticism in Egypt, for it is difficult to ascribe this act to any other
                        cause, knowing as we do the peaceful and quiet character of the Jewish
                        communities in this country. There is in our opinion no reason whatever to
                        believe that such a spirit of religious animosity is generally diffused in
                        the country but we hold, as we have always held, that there are sections of
                        the population, composed we gladly admit, in most cases of its lees and
                        scum, which cherish a violent hostility towards creeds other than their own,
                        and are ready to manifest this hostility whenever the occasion seems
                        suitable. Such sections of the population are sources of danger in view of
                        the constant efforts made by certain journalists to inflame the passions of
                        racial and religious hatred and furnish a standing dementi to the motto of
                        "Hospitable to all" which adorns the English organ of one of the chief of
                        these scribes, whose propaganda, perhaps without intention, has always
                        seemed to us most calculated to use outbreaks of hostility between the
                        various elements of the population of Egypt. We hope that the Nationalist
                        Press will condemn in suitable language the action of the rioters at
                        Mansourah. Otherwise we shall be able to estimate at their true worth their
                        professions of tolerance and disclaimers of anything approaching religious
                        hostility</p>

                    <head>THE "OLIVEMOOR."</head>
                    <p>We have this morning but little authentic news to give concerning the
                        situation of the "Olivemoor," which appears to us to be as favourable as
                        ever. Though salvage operations were commenced last Tuesday the position of
                        the vessel is to-day practically the same as last week. We are officially
                        informed that, given two days of favourable weather, there is every chance
                        of the vessel being refloated, but unfortunately for those in charge of the
                        salvage operations the elements have greatly handicaped the work. Old
                        residents of Alexandria who are qualified to express an opinion, and who are
                        interested in the wreck, tell us that it is quite possible that the wind
                        will veer round to blow from land, in which case the chances of success
                        would be considerably enhanced. No cargo has yet been discharged, beyond the
                        two hundred tons jettisoned before the arrival of the salvage steamer, and
                        the opinion has been expressed to us by one well-informed on nautical points
                        that the vessel probably now contains as mach water as previous to the
                        commencement of pumping operations.</p>

                            of the imports is chiefly due to the higher price of Egyptian cotton,

                            per cent. is accounted for by the trade in cotton seed, which, after

                        <p>Heavy shipments of corn continue to be made to Egypt from this port.
                            Since the Moss S.S. liners no longer pay their visits here at regular
                            frequent intervals, a large share of the Island produce destined for
                            Egyptian ports has been shipped by the weekly mail boat which of láte
                            has had very full cargoes, A good number of cattle and sheep were put on
                            board the Limassol S.S. "Lefkosia" last week, and we understand that a
                            good deal of stoff could not find room. At Paphos a stift S.W. breeze
                            was blowing at the time this vessel called, and owing to the state of
                            the sea and the exposed nature of the anchorage it was not possible to
                            load the merchandise which was awaiting shipment there. Indeed a
                            considerable difficulty was experienced in landing and taking on board
                            the passengers at that port.</p>
                        <p>A number of sponge boats from the Greek Islands are still here. They
                            appear to have had a good season. The Cyprus sponge boats have also been
                            here and at Paphos and report having had successful hauls. The death of
                            one of the divers occurred early in the season, but otherwise there have
                            been no mishaps or casualties.</p>
                        <p>The number of prisoners detained both in the Central Prison and at the
                            various police stations in the Island is exceptional small. It is to be
                            hoped that the satisfactory inference may correctly be drawn from this
                            state of things, that crime is diminishing in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>It is reported that an unprecedently large number of gun licences are
                            being issued this season.</p>
                        <p>A good many cases of malaria have occurred this summer. Almost every
                            large town has suffered from it, and many villages also, but fever has
                            not been of a serious nature.</p>
                        <p>The local Press announces that Mr. Crawford Noble has been appointed an
                            Assistant Forest officer. He is expected to arrive early in October.</p>
                        <p>Mr. George Harvey, Government Veterinary Surgeon is about to be
                            transferred from Nicosia to this town.</p>
                        <p>General Bullock arrived last week from Egypt on a visit of inspection,
                            and proceeded to Troodos. Mr. Fraser, of the Royal Inniskilling
                            Fusiliers accompanied him as A.D.C.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Bucknill, wife of the new King's Advocate, also came, and, with her
                            husband, has gone into camp on Troodos.</p>

                    <p>On the whole the acting of the above company is distintly good, though the
                        talent is unevenly distributed in several cases important parts being filled
                        in amateurish manner, so obvious in awkward movement and attempted abandon.
                        But the stars quite atone for the lesser brilliancy of the satellites, and
                        in particular Mlle Norbert is altogether charming Her clear enunciation,
                        perfect deportment, and mastery of the subtle possibilities of Freoch
                        dialogue and repartee are lessons in the histrionic art. The French stage
                        largely depends on prointed conversation and little setion, both of which
                        characteristics are not tolerated by our own adience. But then convertion
                        with the French is not M with us neity, but fine art. With the additional
                        advantage of its language, there is exceptional opportunity for word play on
                        the gamut of human emotions. As regards the main character MM. Charpentier
                        and Angely are good, but in common with the rest of the company mumble their
                        words, and the Alhambras has not the acoustic properties for drawing room
                        tone. They are rather stagey and occasionally far too much of the novelette
                        type. The repertoire is extensive and contains excellent pieces. "L'Abbe
                        Constantin" in particular being both well played and staged. The porta
                        contain the usual characters of French comedy and drama, the inevitable
                        Abbé, soldier, and vacuous son. The repartee was extremely good and the
                        situations excellent. French playwrights excel in their situations. They
                        know so well how to give the crux of the matter in a word, a look, a
                        gesture! The audiences are fair, and decidedely appreciative </p>

                    <head>INVESTMENT IN EGYPT. </head>
                    <head>SOURCE OF WEALTH.</head>
                    <p>(Continued.) As cotton and its future is of each vital importance to Egypt's
                        welfare, let us next consider the probabilities as regards (a) its quality,
                        (b) ita quantity, and (c) its value, during the next few years. In respect
                        to quality, the Government takes every possible means of encouraging the
                        farmers to grow food seed. The Agricultural Society yearly distributes tens
                        of thousands of bushels of selected cotton seed at cost price, and when the
                        present is temporarily short of ready money the Agrlicultural Bank furnishes
                        goods seed as an advance at resonable rates. Care is taken also that the
                        seed supplied is not only, sound, but that it is likewise of those varieties
                        of the cotton plant which, as years of experience have shown, produce the
                        best quality plus the greatest yield per pod. In like manner artificial
                        fertilizers are supplied by the same society, while the Government annually
                        spend large sums in endeavoring to minimise the ravages so often wrought by
                        the ordinary cotton-worm, by the cut-worm (which eats the roots of the young
                        plants), by the boll-worm, and like pests. As an example of the promptness
                        with which this danger is dealt with, I many mention that the report for the
                        week ending June 20 last states that of 4,891 acres (in 121 different
                        villages) found to be infected with the cotton-warm in the Beherah and
                        Dakahlieh provinces 4,382 acres were cleared, and the damage done to the
                        plants was consequently comparatively insignificant.</p>
                    <p>The quantity of the crop in the future seems assured, for each year more
                        land, chiefly in Upper Egypt has been converted from basin into perennial,
                        and when the new scheme of heightening the Assouan Dam (some 20ft., at a
                        cost of circa £1,500,000) is completed a still greater acreage than at
                        present will come under cultivation and be available for cotton. </p>
                    <p>The question of the future "price" of cotton is a more delicate one. To make
                        any dogmatic assertion would be imprudent, to prophesy would be equally
                        foolish. Certain considerations, nevertheless, may fittingly be set forth.
                        Taking first the general problem of supply and demand, we find that the
                        world's present supply of cotton is not in excess of the world's demand, and
                        that hitherto as production has increased the consumption of the raw
                        material hus likewise steadily angmented. Probably it would not be far wide
                        of the truth to estimate the world's present consumption of cotton per week
                        at very nearly 300,000 bales (say, 1,500,000 cantars), and the anxiety in
                        Lancashire is not, as a rule, a fear of over-supply, but rather takes the
                        form of the query, "Will there be enough raw material to keep all the
                        spindles running full time?" Secondly, the cotton supply of the world may be
                        divided roughly as follows:--America contributes 22/32 of the whole, the
                        East Indies 6/32, Egypt 3/32, and othercountries the remaining thirty-second
                        part. It is obvious that when America's latge crop is adversely affected by
                        weather or other conditions, Egyptian prices should rise, or, at least,
                        continue firm. Yet it does not always follow that when America's cotton crop
                        in very abundant, values of Egyptian cotton décline. For owing chiefly, and
                        this brings as to our third, point, to that dampness in the atmosphere so
                        prevalent and upiversal in Lower Egypt, Delta cotton is practically without
                        rival in colour and staple perhaps, as regards the small quantity of
                        sea-island cotton cultivated in the group off the mainland of Georgia.
                        Egyptian cotton is the only description absolutely adapted for certain
                        manufactures, though employed in many and the fact is curious that there is
                        a large and new demand for long-staple cotton (this year amounting to some
                        60,000 cantars) in connection with the manfictite of tyren for automobiles.
                        So the demand for "Egyptian" is constant and increasing, and is not entity
                        dependent on whether the United States produce good or bad crops; and this
                        is very clearly demonstrated by the fact that America herself yearly imports
                        an increasing quantity of Egyptian cotton. Since 1896 such imports into the
                        United States hate augmented by about 33%, and, owing to long staple upland
                        being now rarely grown in America, a few American mills depend almost
                        entirely on the supply from Egypt. Although Egyptian cotton seed of the
                        finest quality has been procured by foreigners, and sown in nearly every
                        cotton-growing country in the world, the product, though excellent, has
                        never, speaking generally, approached, in so far a colour and staple are
                        concerned, the cotton raised in the Delta from precisely similar seed,
                        though it is right to mention that retent attempts to acclimatise Egyptian
                        cotton on the banks of the Indias (in Sinde) are said to have met with some
                        success. Personally, I believe this to be due to the absence in other
                        contrit of that before mentioned dampness so prevalent in the Delta at a
                        critical period of the plant's growth; but whether it is really owing to
                        atmospheric or climatic influences influences, or, as has been held, to some
                        peculiar qualities of the Nile mud soil, is really immaterial, except as a
                        matter of interest to aricultural scientists, so long as the fact remains
                        that the best qualities of Egyptian cotton cannot be grown elsewhere in the
                        same perfection in the Delta. It would be futile to maintain that prices may
                        not fall, all the foregoing favourable confiderations notwithstanding, yet
                        the above data should assist in the formation of a reasonable opinion, and
                        the balance of profitabilty seems to favour the maintenance of fairly high
                        prices under normal circumstances; while under prudent guidance Egypt should
                        undoubtedly, as in her ancient days, be able in years of plenty to make
                        provision for periods less favoured.</p>

                    <p>In our article a week ago on that very prosperous undertaking, the Egyptian
                        Markets, we gave a brief outline of its position, and the scope of its
                        operations. The favourale view which we then expressed as to its prespects
                        in the future may now he confirmed by the mention of some further
                        considerations, establishing any reader to form a correct judgement as to
                        the soundness of the shares as an investment at to the present time. Not the
                        least conclusive of the evidence to be adduced is the mere fact that,
                        whereas during the past few weeke Egyptian authorities of an industrial
                        nature have almost without exception suffered a severe loss in market value,
                        the shares in Egyptian Markets have been affected to quite a trifing extent,
                        and remain still only slightly below the highest price ever noted for them

                    </p>
                    <p>The reason for this exceptional steadiness in the shares of a company which
                        stand at nearly 50 per cent above par, although they pay the holder rarely 2
                        per cent. at that price, can only be that they are in the hands of very
                        strong people whose faith in the future of the concern is founded on the
                        most reliable bases, and is not capable of being shaken to any perceptible
                        extent by the storms of advese opinion and the blasts of financial
                        discourage ment which make such wreckage of the weaker speculative ventures.
                        If, in search of reasons to account for this phenomenon, we look to
                        evidences derived from the country itself, there is no difficulty in finding
                        plenty of them. In the first place, the people for whom this company caters,
                        and upon whose custom it thrives, are the indigenous natives of Egypt - the
                        fellaheen. And to these rustics, whose views and whose interests do not
                        extend far beyond their own paddy-fields or cotton or sugar plantations,
                        the</p>

                        <hi rend="bold">Ups-and-downs of Speculation</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>in land or shares have no meaning and no importance. Many of them do not even
                        know what is meant by bank, but bury their savings in the ground. The
                        markets--of which there are no less than 120 in Upper and Lower Egypt--are
                        the one publie institution in which they believe, and where they transact
                        business. It is needless to say that this business has been growing just as
                        fast during the late bad times in Alexandria as it did in the days when the
                        Levantines and Greeks and other clever people in the cities were running
                        riot in extravagant speculations. Then, again, the agriculturist has been,
                        in his slow way, imbibing a confidence and a feeling of reliance upon the
                        British company which has brought within easy reach of him the </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">Convenience of a Ready Market.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>for his cattle and other commodition. This will be greatly fortified and
                        augmented when the Markets have become the sole agents for the two important
                        companies which work the salt monopoly. The great advantage that will accrue
                        from this agency may be roughly estimated when it is remembered that the
                        same staff which is now employed in managing the Markets will be able
                        without extra expense, to undertake the duties connected with the salt
                        tunde, which is important an item in the financial budget in Egypt as it is
                        in India. Moreover the farmer in the rich valley of the Nile, as well as in
                        the less fertile fields further removed from the river, is fast learning
                        what benefits may result to him from </p>
                    <p>The Employment of Nitrates.</p>
                    <p>The trade in this commodity, which has been secured by the company, will be
                        one of the largest and most increasingly remuneractive branches of its
                        business. If now we endeavour to find any element of danger or risk to which
                        the company's interests are exposed, we small have a difficulty in finding
                        it, except in the cattle disease, which in the years 1903 and 1904 seriously
                        interfered with operations, and practically rendered the Market
                        unremuneractive for some months. The situation has now been altogether
                        changed. The disease although not altogether eliminated, has been localised,
                        and</p>
                    <p>Precautionary Measures</p>
                    <p>have now been taken whereby it will be rendered impossible for it to spread
                        from one district to another. If the objection is taken that the company's
                        concession will expire in 1938, when the shares will have no further value
                        as an investment, the reply is that the very first charge of the annual
                        income is the contribution to a sinking fond as such sum as will enable the
                        shareholders to receive back their capital intact when the concession comes
                        to end. The details of the arrangement by which this simple result is noured
                        we must explain at another time. </p>

                            <p>The "Times" comments on the danger of the Hagne Conference seeking to
                                hide failure by nominally sanctioning a number of showy
                                ill-considered propositions in order to impress an uninstructed
                                public. It cites the case of the Prize Court and says that the
                                reason for which Russia and Japan provisionally withheld their
                                assent was weighty. It urges that England should follow the example
                                of her sagacious ally Japan and take time to minutely study the
                                Prize Court scheme before committing herself. <hi rend="italic"

                    <head>THE LEBANON EXPERIMENT</head>
                    <p>The special correspondent to the Times" writes from Beyrout as follows:--</p>
                    <p>The nomination of Yusuf Pasha to the Governorship of the Lebanon has not been
                        received with any great enthusiasm in "the Mountain." The fear that the new
                        Governor wonld follow the pro-elerical policy of his father, Franco Nasri
                        Pasha, who governed the Lebanon from 1868 to 1873, had already provoked a
                        demonstration of over 1,500 anti-clericals from the Maronite district of
                        Kesrawan, with a few Druses who, on July 3, appeared in Beirut, and begged
                        the Vali to transmit a petition to the Porte protesting against his
                        appointment. It is quite possible that the petition never reached the Porte;
                        but, however vain their protest, the anti-clericals of what was till
                        recently the most bigoted district in the Maronite territory had at least
                        the satisfaction of showing Beirut that their strength, sedulously minimized
                        by the clergy, was numerically greater than their opponents had dared to
                        admit. Other sections of the population regarded with some anxiety. the
                        appointment of the son of a former Governor, connected by marriage with
                        Naoum Pasha, who preceded the late Muzaffer Pasha as Governor of the
                        province, arguing that the new Mutesarrif was not unlikely to be influenced
                        by the supporters of his father and Naonm Pasha in the appointment and
                        dismissal of functionaries, from the point of view of the numerous
                        placehunters of the Lebanon, the most important of the prerogatives of the
                        Governor of "the Mountain."</p>
                    <p>The future will show how far these apprehensions are well grounded ;
                        meanwhile Yusuf Pasha will require greater abilities than those with which
                        he is credited, even by his supporters, if he is to make a firm stand
                        against the intrigues of families and factions and the growth of political
                        corruption, which proved too strong for his predecessor. For Muzaffer
                        Pasha's administration this much may be claimed---namely, that it equitably
                        maintained the balance between the various religious secta, each of which
                        was, and is, only too ready to take offence at the slightest encroachment,
                        real or fancied, on its rights as guaranteed by the Organic Law of 1861.
                        Otherwise, it was unsuccessful ; Liberal views and good intentions, personal
                        integrity, tact, and kindliness could not atone for the fatal weakness of
                        will that made the late Governor the pappet of intrigues local, Consular,
                        and domestic and disappointed all who had believed that his early promises
                        of administrative reform would be carried into effect. But whatever may have
                        been urged against Muzaffer Pasha's administation, what ever may be urged in
                        the future against that of Yusuf Pasha, it must be admitted that the
                        position of the Governor of the Lebanon has become far from enviable.
                        Though, perhaps, the most independent of Ottoman officials during his term
                        of office, he is none the less compelled, in view of his eventual return to
                        Constantinople, to avoid all action that may ruffle the susceptibilities or
                        arouse the suspicions of the Sultan. The Great Powers of Europe' through
                        their representatives at Beirut and Constantinople, take a more or less
                        active interest in his administration ; religious rival ries, the intrigues
                        of local notables and of the administrative council, an antiquated
                        Constitution, and an illogical system of local finance hamper his every
                        action. He is, in short, condemned to carry out a most difficult task with
                        the aid of obsolete machinery and with the certainty of interference from
                        without and within. </p>
                    <p>It may be urged that this is a somewhat cavalier criticism of the results of
                        the experiment of 1860, that since the interference of Europe the Lebanon
                        has enjoyed complete immunity from the disturbances that are endemic in
                        other provinces of the Ottoman Empire, that the Lebanese are themselves
                        mainly to blame for the growing disorganization of the administration, or
                        that, given a strong Governor of the type of Rustem Pasha, all would once
                        more go well in the Mountain." Before replying to these objections it is
                        necessary to give a brief sketch of the physical and social conditions of
                        the province, as far as they have any bearing upon local politics, and of
                        its Constitution according to the modified Organic Law ot 1864. </p>
                    <p>"THE MOUNTAIN" AND ITS PEOPLE</p>
                    <p>The province of Lebanon, as defined by the protocols of 1861 and 1864, is not
                        conterminous with the mountain range of that name. It may be roughly
                        described as a strip of mountainous country, bounded on the east by the
                        watershed and on the west by the Mediterranean, averaging some 25 miles in
                        breadth, and extending some 40 miles north and 80 miles south of Beirut,
                        which, with the towns of Tripoli and Sidon, is under direct Ottoman
                        administration. On the eastern slope of the central range of the Lebanon the
                        town and part of the district of Zahleh belong to the province, as does the
                        isolated village of Hurmil, 30 miles northwest of Baalbeck. Except in the
                        neighbourhood of Beirut and in part of the district of Kūra immediately
                        south of Tripoli, the country is simply a succession of stony ridges,
                        projecting westward like ribs from the backbone of the central chain and
                        separated from one another by deep and often precipitous ravines. Save in
                        the low-lying areas that have been mentioned, the country is naturally
                        little suited to agriculture, the whole of the corn crop, planted in the
                        stoniest of soils, being insufficient to supply the needs of the population
                        of the province for three months. The plodding industry of the pesants has
                        covered the billsides with terraces, on which mulberries, vines, and a few
                        other fruits are grown, and sericulture is now the principal, and in many
                        districts almost the only, occapation of the people, the bulk of the
                        ooooons, waste silk, and <cb n="4"/>silk thread exported, to the amount of
                        nearly 25,000 bales during the last three years, from Beirut and Tripoli
                        coming from the Lebanon villages. Some 20 silk spinning mills, few of which
                        employ more than 60 persons, are at work mainly in the central districts of
                        the province. Vines are very generally grown, and some very good wine is
                        manufactured in the neighbourhood of Zahleh. Sheep and goats are fairly
                        numerous, and the latter most destructive to the scanty remnants of the
                        forests which once covered the mountains. Minerals may exist in paying
                        quantities within certain areas, but on this point nothing appears to be
                        definitely known.</p>
                    <p>The whole configuration of the country makes for political disunion. A
                        village is often nearly a day's journey from its <hi rend="italic"
                            >vis-à-vis</hi> on the next ridge or on the next but one, only four or
                        five miles away as the crow flies, but separated by precipitous gorges
                        hundreds of feet deep, and perhaps eight or ten miles in length. Religion,
                        here as elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, the principal cause of political
                        division, has aided nature in accentuating the differences between the
                        various sections of what seems to have been originally a fairly homogeneous
                        population. There are certainly two or three general racial types that may
                        be found, at times in the same family, all over Syria; but it is equally
                        certain that some Europeans and many natives who possess a thorough
                        knowledge of the country and its people can usually distinguish between a
                        Maronite and a Greek Catholic, a Moslem and a Druse. The majority of the
                        religions and sects of Syria are represented in "the Mountain." Isolated
                        groups of Moslems, both Sannis and Metwali Shiahs, with a few mountain
                        Beduin, occur in the southern district of Shaf, near Zahleh, and in
                        Kesrawan, while isolated Hormil is mainly inhabited by Metwalis. Shof is the
                        centre of the Lebanon Druses, who are also represented in the central
                        district of Metn and in Jezzin in the extreme south. To turn to the
                        Christian sects, the northern districts, with the important exception of
                        Kura, &amp; Greek Orthodox stronghold, are almost entirely inhabited by
                        Maronites, Zahleh is predominantly Greek Catholic, and in the southern
                        provinces the sects are mixed, the Maronites being rather more numerous than
                        the Orthodox Greeks, while small groups of Protestants occur bere and there,
                        usually in the neighbourhood of mission stations. No census having been
                        taken since 1862, it impossible to give more than an approximate estimate of
                        the present population of the province. According to the best-informed
                        autborities, tbe Maronites number about 220,000, the Druses 60,000, and the
                        Orthodox Greeks some 45,000, the balance of from 60,000 to 70,000 souls
                        being mainly composed of Greek Catholics and Sunni and Metwali Moslems, </p>
                    <p>Like most mountaineers, the peasants, who constitute the great majority of
                        the population, are a decidedly attractive race. Physically strong,
                        well-made, and often good looking, they are mentally a shrewd, sharp-witted
                        folk, with an intelligence that is more Buropean-that is, more ratiocinative
                        and controlled to a greater extent by conscious logical processes-than that
                        of the average uneducated or half-educat ed Egyptian, whose pind never seems
                        to have room for more than a few fixed <hi rend="italic"
                        >quasi</hi>-instinctive ideas which he may attempt to defend, but at which
                        he seldom seems to arrive, with the aid of reason. Politically unstable and
                        inclined to petty intrigue, as opportunist as most of their neighbours,
                        still somewhat deficient in moral courage, regarding local affairs too often
                        from &amp; sectarian or personal standpoint, their civic qualities are still
                        rudimentary, though better developed than those of certain other Oriental
                        races. In enterprise, courage, self-respect, and freedom from petty crime
                        they are far superior to the Egyptian; but what most impresses the visitor
                        from Egypt is their respect for women, whose influence on the family life of
                        the people is very marked both among Christians and Druses. A girl may
                        travel alone through the most solitary districts of "the Mountain" without
                        fear of harm, and per contra the sight of a laden woman staggering along in
                        the dust behind her lord, who rides comfortably on an ass, common enough in
                        the Nile Valley, is extremely rare, if not unknown, among the Lebanese. </p>
                    <p>It would be tedious and unprofitable to describe the civil war of 1860, which
                        was simply the culmination of an ancient quarrel between the closely-knit
                        Druse community led by the powerful families of Jumblat and Arslan and the
                        less cohesive Maronites, directed and often led by their numerous and
                        powerful clergy. The conflict was marked by numerous terrible incidents,
                        such as the sack of Zahleh and the massacre at Dêr el Kamar ; but it may be
                        noted that the Druses, if ruthless in battle, abstained from inflicting any
                        insult or harm on women and children, the more brutal outrages that
                        disgraced the struggle being the work of Turkish troops and of bands of
                        fanatical Moslems from the vilayets of Beirut and Damascus. The civil war
                        and the savage antiChristian outbreaks in the vilayets caused the
                        intervention of the Powers, which resulted in granting of administrative
                        autonomy to the Lebanon. Though deprived of its natural outlets to the sea
                        and shorn of some of its most fertile areas, the new province secured the
                        inestimable advantage of being guaranteed against direct Turkish
                        interference or administration. Its constitution, as framed in the Organic
                        Law of 1861-6, its revised version of 1864, may be very briefly summarized. </p>
                    <p>The province is administered by an irremovable Christian Governor appointed
                        for a period of five years and directly dependent upon the Porte. He
                        possesses full administrative powers, save in loyal finance, is responsible
                        for the collection of taxes and the maintence of public order, and the
                        appointment of administrative and executive officials, including Judges of
                        first instance and appeal. He also convokes <cb n="5"/>the council known as
                        the Mejlis el Idarah. This body is composed of 12 representatives of the
                        seven administrative districts, or kaima kamliks, of "the Mountain" chosen
                        from the dominant seot or seots of each district. Thus Kara is represented
                        by an Orthodox Greek, Zahleh by a Greek Catholic, Shaf by a Druse and a
                        Moslem. The members are elected by the sheikhs of the villages for a period
                        of six years, four members retiring every two years with the right to
                        re-election. The functions of the council are consultative and financial;
                        the latter are of very considerable importance, for the Mejlis el Idareh is,
                        to all intents and purposes, an inde pendent department of finance, solely
                        responsible for the framing of the Budget, the imposition of taxes, infine,
                        for the entire control of the revenue and expenditure. In financial matters
                        its word is law, and, though Naoum Pasha shortly after his appointment as
                        Ambassador obtained the permission of the Porte and the Powers to dismiss
                        every member of the council on the ground of its improper interference with
                        elections, there are obvious reasons against the frequent adoption of so
                        drastic a measure. The administrative unit is the Nah ieh, or village
                        commune, under a sheikh elected by the inhabitants, dependent on the
                        mudirieh, or subdistrict, which is in turn dependent on the kaymakamlik, or
                        administrative district. The kaimakans are appointed by the Governor, the
                        Medjis by the Governor in theory on the recommendation of the kaimakam. The
                        electors of the Mejlis el Idareh are the sheikhs of the village communes of
                        each district, who also possess the power to try petty cases of
                        misdemeanour, &amp;c, and to impose fines not exceeding 200 piastres, their
                        judicial functions resembling those of justices of the peace. Crimes are
                        dealt with by the Courts of first instance and appeal, in which the
                        principle of representation by communities is followed in all "mixed"
                        cases--that is, cases in which the parties are of a different religion or
                        sect. </p>

                    <p>It is many years ago now since I was first taken with kidney trouble. It
                        began with a dull, grinding pain in the small of my back, bat after a while
                        there were sharp, sudden pangs of pain, which nearly brought me down, and
                        these were followed by other symptoms of kidney trouble, especially gravel,
                        and great pain in passing water. </p>
                    <p>During pregnancy, the pains were much harder to bear, and just before the
                        birth of my last child there was complete stoppage, which alarmed me very
                        much. My limbs swelled up, and my eyesight was affected. I used to get such
                        pains in the head that I hardly knew what to do with myself.</p>
                    <p>Doctors and medicine alike failed to give me any relief, but at last I have
                        found help in Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. They have been &amp; real
                        blessing to me, and I will always say 80; nothing has ever given me such
