                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <p>"One-fifth of all the cocok and chocolate we take is now produced for us by a
                        form of black labour as truly slavery as anything on our own possessions
                        before the Emancipation or on the plantations of the Southern States before
                        the American Civil War." Thus Mı. H. W. Nevinson endeavours, in the course
                        of a striking article in the September "Portnightly," to bring home to
                        Englishmen their concern in the continuance of the Angola slave trade. A
                        trade in slaves, beyond question, the contract labour system of the great |
                        Portaguese province of sub-equatorial Africa</p>
                    <p>is proved to be. Mr. Nevinson recalls the first piteous evidence which he
                        himself saw on the East and West road from the interior to Bengnella and
                        Loanda - "innumerable shackles hanging on trees or strewn on the ground,
                        skulls and bones lying on the path or in the bush close by, murdered men and
                        women in every stage of decomposition, sometimes with the cleft of the axe
                        visible in the skulls." Seized in dative fends, pawned to pay off ancestral
                        or village debts, sold by Congo rebel soldiers, or raided over the frontier,
                        such of the wretched victims as survive are disposed of either to the
                        mainland | plantations - where they "work in gange, watched by drivers who
                        urge them on with hippo whips or long pointed staves" - or to masters in the
                        towns, where they do practically all the domestic and other work and are
                        treated as absolute property, or to the cocoa islands of St. Thomas and
                        Principe. About four thousand a year are exported to the islands, and, says
                        Mr. Nevinson, "none ever come back."</p>
                    <p>This last is a peculiarly deadly fact. The Portuguese Government, which is as
                        deeply pledged as we are ourselves to the abolition of slave-trading, says,
                        and the Portuguese people no doubt believe, that a system of voluntary
                        contract and repatriation is in effect. Mr. Nevinson declares that the
                        contracts are fraudulent, and that they are regularly renewed without
                        consent. "The climate," he adds, "in most parts, especially on Principe, is
                        very unhealthy, the work is long and hard, the life entirely uninteresting
                        and monotonous ; flogging with chicotte and palinatoria is common ; big dogs
                        and sentries are kept to prevent the slaves running away ; if they are
                        caught escaping in boats they are brought back and flogged ; if they escape
                        to the forests as many do, the regulations provide for organized hunting
                        parties. But as slavery goes, the treatment is not cruel, because cruelty is
                        so expensive." For every slave it costs from £10 to £40. The later evidence
                        which Mr. Nevinson offers in support of the case set forth in his recent
                        book appears to be unanswerable. His most important proposal is that no
                        five-yene contract should be renewable unless the native has first returned
                        to the mainland. He suggests, as a last hope, a boycott by British and other
                        cocoa manufacturers ; but we suggest that it will be time enough to try
                        private influence when the representations to the Portuguese Government
                        which the Foreign Office has expressed its willingness to make, have proved
                        useless.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday morning a well-deserved lesson was given to an insolent
                            European in the Rue de l'Ancienne Bourse for molesting a lady. For some
                            time past the man had annoyed the lady by approaching her in the street
                            and insulting her by his action. The lady complained to her husband, who
                            arranged that she should walk down the street while he kept a short
                            distance behind her. This the lady did and as usual the man accosted
                            her, whereupon she struck him across the face, and the man had then to
                            submit to probably the soundest thrashing from her husband to which he
                            had ever been treated. A police officer intervened and arrested the man,
                            who we trust will now have to suffer a severe punishment administered by
                            the law. </p>

                        <head>A Disagreeable Contretemps.</head>
                        <p>A very disagreeable contretemps occurred recently to the housekeeper of a
                            prominent official in the Fayoum. The lady in question, of the mildest
                            disposition, was met by the cavass of the Greek Consulate on her arrival
                            at Cairo, and requested to accompany him to the Hellenic Consulate under
                            suspicion of being concerned with events of * a questionable character,
                            in Upper Egypt which happened recently. The charge was completely
                            unfounded and an error of the grossest nature had been committed by the
                            cavass. The lady made the most vigorous protest and insisted on being
                            conveyed to the Continental Hotel where her identity could be
                            established. This was done and further annoyance obviated, but it is to
                            be hoped that similar difficulties will be rendered, impossible in the
                            future.</p>

                    <p>On the 27th ulto. Mr. J.H. Robertson asked the Secretary of State for Foreign
                        Affairs whether he can yet give any information as to the number of
                        buildings which have collapsed in Alexandria, Cairo and their environs, in
                        the past 12 months, and the number of persons thereby killed and
                        injured.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey. The report which has been called for on the subject has not yet
                        been received.</p>
                    <p>STUDENTS FOR EUROPE. </p>
                    <p>Mr. John Robertson asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs if he can
                        yet state the total amount of provision made by the Egyptian Government for
                        sending students to Europe, and what prospect there is of increase in the
                        number of qualified Egyptian teachers.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey. The budget of the Egyptian Ministry of Education for 1908 has
                        not yet been considered by the Council of Ministers and will not be finally
                        settled till October. It is therefore impossible to say what the special
                        credit alloted for the particular purpose will be.</p>
                    <p>I may state, however, that the Egyptian Ministry of Education is making
                        arrangements with a view to sending this autumn 19 Egyptian students, a
                        number not previously equalled, for training and further study in England,
                        in addition to those who are already in this country undergoing special
                        courses of instruction. It is hoped that all these Egyptian students, on the
                        completion of their training, will enter the service of the Egyptian
                        Government as teachers.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rees asked whether it was right that the money of the Egyptian taxpayers
                        should thus be expended in denationalising Egyptian students.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey, replied that the object of the expenditure was to qualify
                        Egyptian students to give the higher forms of instructions to their own
                        countrymen, and that the expenditure of this kind was as proper in Egypt as
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. M. Robertson asked whether denationalising was not rather set up by
                        the process of filling the Egyptian Civil Service with Englishmen.
                        (Cheers.)</p>
                    <p>EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J.M. Robertson asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether
                        he will obtain for the information of the House a classified list of
                        professors who were employed by the Egyptian Government in teaching the
                        sciences in Arabic at the date of the British occupation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J.M. Robertson asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether
                        he will obtain for the information of the House a classified list of works,
                        written in or translated into Arabic, upon scientific and technical
                        subjects, and published in Arabic by the National Printing Press of Egypt,
                        between the date of Mohamed Ali's accession, 1806, and that of the British
                        occupation 1882.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey. In answer to these questions, I must point out that I have
                        already caused a great deal of extra, and in some cases laborious work on
                        the part of officials in Egypt by asking for detailed information in reply
                        to questions.</p>
                    <p>In this case I do not think it would be reasonable to ask them to make
                        enquiries dating back to 1806. I do not know whether the information could
                        be obtained, I do not suppose it could be obtained without much trouble, and
                        when obtained, a list of persons and books could not be a guide to the value
                        of the instruction given by them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robertson asked whether the required books could not be easily obtained
                        from the catalogue of the Khedivial|Library; and whether such a list would
                        not be a much better basis for conclusions as to the possibility of teaching
                        the sciences in Arabic than the guesswork which had been hitherto presented
                        to the House.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey replied that without a knowledge of Arabic the House would not be
                        able to draw any conclusion from such a list of books.</p>
                    <p>THE DENISHWAI SENTENCES </p>
                    <p>Mr. Lehmann Asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he can
                        state where the prisoners sentenced to penal servitude act Dinesh wai are
                        carrying out their sentences, what is the nature of their labour, and if
                        they are in irons: and whether if they had been tried under the ordinary
                        law, such punishment as they are | now suffering could have been imposed on
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Runciman, on behalf of Sir E. Grey. My Rt. Hon friend has not the special
                        information asked for on these points, but the sentences of the imprisonment
                        are served in the same way as if they had been imposed by ordinary law.</p>
                    <p>Sir William Collins, asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
                        whether the decree of 1895, under which the Denishawi prisoners were tried,
                        excludes all right of appeal against sentences ; and whether this also
                        precludes the exercise of clemency, on the part of the Khedive in the case
                        of capital sentences such as is provided for in the ordinary law of
                        Egypt</p>
                    <p>Mr. Runciman, on behalf of Sir E. Grey - The text of the decree which the
                        Hon. Members will find on p. 8 of Parliamentary Paper "Egypt No. 3 (1906)"
                        states in the last paragraph of Article 4, that the sentences shall not be
                        subject to appeal. If the Hon. Member will refer to p. 24 of the same Paper,
                        he will see that the adoption of some procedure by which <cb n="3"/>the
                        decisions of the Special Tribunal shall be I confirmed by some superior
                        authority is under consideration, and the Tribunal will not be called into
                        existence without some euch provision.</p>
                    <p>THE SPECIAL TRIBUNAL. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Mackarness, asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the
                        deeree under which the special tribunal which tried the Denishwai prisoners
                        was set up in any way prescribes what law is to be administered or what
                        punishments may be inflicted and whether he can say if the law actually
                        applied in the Denishwai trials was British, Egyptian or Mahommedan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Runciman, on behalf of Sir B. Grey, My Rt. Hon. Friends can only refer to
                        the Hon. Member to the text of the decree, which has been laid before
                        Parliament, and to the observations of Lord Cromer as to the kind of
                        punishments which should be in future prescribed if the Special Tribunal
                        were again called into existence.</p>
                    <p>HAFEZ AWAD'S DEMANDS. </p>
                    <p>Mr. MacNeill,- To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether he
                        has received an outline of views and wishes of the Egyptian nation as
                        regards changes in the administration of Egypt which have already been
                        sanctioned by the general assembly at its recent meeting, forwarded to him
                        as Member of the House of Commons by M. A. Hafiz Awad, the proposals for the
                        establishment of the constitution being based on the schemes put forward by
                        Lord Dufferin in 1883 ; whether he is aware that the programme of the
                        Egyptian national party embraces free and compulsory education in all
                        schools, the conferring of legislative powers on the general assembly and
                        legislative council in matters relating purely to Egyptian affairs, the
                        gradual substitution of Egyptian for European officials and the transference
                        of the criminal jurisdiction of the consular courts to mixed courts with
                        subsidiary grants ; and whether, having regard to the fact that these
                        proposals are authoritatively declared to constitute the minimum of the
                        reforms necessary for Egyptian needs and aspirations the Government will
                        take any, and, if so, what steps in the immediate future towards their
                        concession.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Runciman, on behalf of Sir E. Grey replied :-My Rt. Hon. friend has
                        received a communication of the nature described by the Hon. Member. But he
                        has nothing to add to the statement of policy which he made in the debate on
                        the Foreign Office Vote.</p>

                    <dateline>Aden, August 26. </dateline>
                    <p>That the military situation in Yemen is worse than ever is evidenced by the
                        outbreaks among the Turkish troops in the Yemen, which have become so
                        frequent of late us to be unparalleled in the history of the Yemen campaign,
                        and for which the treatment received | by the troops, and their arrears of
                        pay is solely responsible. Advice received from Yemen states that a mutiny
                        has broken out among the troops in Amran, which lies about three days from
                        Sana. These troops are under the command of Ydssif Pasha, and about 3000 of
                        them under arins have left Amran and proceeded to Hodeida, and from there
                        they want to embark for their homes. They have now reached Manakha, and on
                        their way from Amran they have given trouble to the people. * A telegraphic
                        message was dispatched from Sanaa to Hodeidah informing the authorities to
                        be on the lookout. Much apprehension is entertained at Hodeidah of coming
                        trouble.</p>

                    <head>WEATHER DURING AUGUST.</head>
                    <p>We have received from the Survey Department the following report on the
                        weather in Egypt and the Sudan during August 1907</p>
                    <p>The normal meteorological conditions in August are that a region of high
                        pressure lies over the western Mediterranean and Northwest Africa, and in
                        southern Africa in the neighbourhood of lat. 20°8. From these regions there
                        is a steady gradient towards the Indian region of low pressure to the east
                        of the Persian gulf. These conditions remain very constant giving steady
                        breezes and clear skies as far as Dongola. South of this, southerly winds
                        occur with frequent thunderstorms and rain.</p>
                    <p>During the past month pressure was in moderate excess in Egypt, and in large
                        excess in Sudan. Temperature was above normal | in Egypt reaching 39° C at
                        Helwan and 48 C</p>
                    <p>in Aswan, but in Sudan it was much below the average, the mean of the month
                        near Khartoum, Dueim and Wad Medani being more than 2 below the pormal.</p>
                    <p>The distribution of the rainfall is remarkable ; at Khartoum, Kassala and Wad
                        Medapi the amount recorded was in excess of the average by 144, 127 and 57
                        mm. respectively, while numerous washouts on the railways were reported.</p>
                    <p>In Eritrea rainfall at Adi Ugri was also in slight excess. In Abyssinia at
                        Addis Ababa however there was a deficiency of 14 % in the first half of the
                        month, and except for very heavy rainfall about the 20th which caused a
                        large flood wave in both the Blue Nile and the Atbara there has not been a
                        sustained improvement.</p>

                    <p>The journey has been one of immense difficulty, owing both to the sand of the

                        18,400 tons when completed. She will be turbine engined, with an energy of

                        flesh. He was, says the "City | Press' ', the second son of the late Captain
                        James Bennett, of the East India Company's service, and that officer was on
                        duty at St. Helena at the time of the arrival there of Napoleon. Young
                        George Bennett spent his childhood on the island, and had many opportunities
                        of seeing the famous captive there, and was able in after-life to relate
                        interesting anecdotes as to his early impressions and experiences. He came
                        to England for his education, and when later, as a young officer, he was
                        proceeding to the Cape, the ship he was in arrived at St. Helena at the time
                        of the translation of the late Emperor's remains from the place of burial on
                        the island to the French warship sent by King Louis Philippe to convey them
                        to France. Commissary Bennet never returned to England, for, having served
                        on the Cape command until he retired under the age conditions, he bought a
                        charming house at Hof Street, near Cape Town, and spent his remaining days
                        there. He had, therefore, no opportunities of being connected with the City,
                        but his father, Captain Bennett, was admitted a Freeman in March, 1808, and
                        his grandfather, Thomas Bennett, was a "Citizen and Joiner." Commissary
                        Bennett was ninety-one years of age.</p>

                    <p>This work consists of five lectures first published in "The Expository Times'
                        ' (Oet. 1906 April 1907) and translated from the German by L.R.M. Strachan,
                        M.A. Dr. Deissmann deals with the question of the discoveries of
                        archaeologists in relation to Primitive Christianity. Whilst admitting the
                        importance of the literary materials, he points out that these are only
                        fragmentary, and protests against over estimating the worth of the purely
                        literary evidence. The importance of the non-literary evidence, i.e. the
                        innumerable texts on stone, metal, papyrus, | wood or clay has only been
                        made accessible during recent years, and the author states that the
                        recognition of their importance for the historical understanding of
                        Primitive Chris tienity is still by no means general.</p>

                    <head>HORSESHOE DINNER.</head>
                    <p>As reported in our issue of yesterday the English jockeys of the Alexandria
                        Sporting Club and several of their friends met at dinner on Saturday night
                        at the Abbey Hotel under the presidency of Mr. N. Smith and with Mr. Taylor
                        as vice-chairman This meeting, the first of what is to become an annual
                        event, was a true sportsman's meeting, and it would have been gratifying to
                        the owners of the stables to witness the friendship and bonne camaraderie
                        existing between the sporting rivals who ride their horses for victory, and
                        many of whom have attained it with brilliant.</p>
                    <p>As an introduction to the dinner the toast of the King and Constitution was
                        drunk, and after that evidence of loyalty which is one of the most prominent
                        characteristics of every true sportsman, the meeting settled down to dispose
                        of as excellent a menn as has ever graced a table. With the advent of
                        dessert the toast of the Guests was proposed by Mr. Nanny who coupled with
                        it the names of Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Whiteside, from whose dinners in
                        previous years the idea of instituting an annual horseshoe dinner
                        originated. Mr. Whiteside responded and after the toast had been drunk with
                        hearty acclamation, Mr. Stillwel! followed by a song. Mr. Taylor then
                        proposed Sport, which was replied to by Mr. Jenkins, and the programme was
                        next varied by a violin solo most sympathetically rendered by Mr. Smith. The
                        Army and Navy, proposed by Mr.Clements, was the next tonat, and this was
                        replied to by Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Macgregor then proposed a cordial toast to
                        the Press which was responded to by Mr. Swanson, The toast of Commerce was
                        given by Mr. Husky and responded to by Mr. Denman, and a special toast to
                        Mr. Bonser as the oldest jockey of Alexandria, proposed by Mr. Taylor, was
                        then received with "For he's a jolly good fellow." Mr. Wiloooks gave us the
                        toast of Harmony, which indeed was the tone of the evening's meeting. Among
                        those who contributed to the evening's enjoyment with songs were Mr.
                        Jenkins, Mr. Bonser, Mr. Sidey, Mr. Galley, Mr. Wallacker, and Mr. Rance who
                        recited "the Kissing Cup" from the well-known play "Run-a-look."</p>
