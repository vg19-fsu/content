                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <p>ARABIC FOR "FLOWS THE WATER."</p>
                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>
                    <p>Invaluable for immediately curing mosquito and insect bites and for greatly
                        preventing them.</p>

                    <p>There are some hooka happy io their publication, but few more so than these
                        two magnificent volumes that Dr. Budge has published on "The Egyptian Sudan
                        : Its History and ita Monuments" (Kegan, Paul, and Co.). It is, indeed, a
                        fortunate coincidence that these volumes should appear just at the moment
                        when the man to whom the Sudan owes ita regeneration has laid down his
                        sceptre The Sudan owes its return to civilisation, and a place in the
                        world's history, to Lord Cromer, and ita future progress and return to its
                        old fertility to Sir Edmund Garstin, G.C.M G., to whom this work is
                        dedicated. In his dedication the author uses some very apt terms "He
                        measured and curbed the river of Egypt, and set bounds to the flood thereof,
                        and turned the wilderness irtn a pool of water."</p>
                    <p>Few civilians know the Sudan as the author ol these volumes does. He has
                        visited it on four separate occasions. He has seen it in its desolation from
                        the Mahdist invasion, he has made his explorations at Gebel Baikal, in the
                        thick of the advance on Khartoum in 1897, and he his seen it when
                        civilisation had triumphed, aid peace reigned in the land, and prosperity
                        wis returning. His knowledge is no superficial tourist gleaning, but
                        personal. He lived anong the people, speaking their language— aid vis. ted
                        almost every town and village as far as Khartoum. It is very difficult to do
                        jiHtice to these volumes of over twelve hundred piges in a short review, for
                        not only does he give us the history of the Sudan from B.c. 4000 to A. D.
                        1904, but he deals with almost every inaginable subject which should be
                        dealt with in the description of a country. There are clapters on
                        Christianity in the Sudan, and tlese are almost entirely new matter, on the
                        etlnology of a land of many tribes and nationaliies, and this portion is
                        illustrated with splendid photographs. The varied languages ancidialects are
                        dealt with and classified. Lastly, there are chapters descriptive of tlfi
                        Blue and the White Nile, right up to the great laics. It is hardly to be
                        supposed that it is derived fom the author's own personal experience—hut,
                        nevertheless, it is a most vivid description, and illustrated by over a
                        hundred photographs, the best being done by Miss Hilda Burrows. Those
                        photographsgive one a totally new idea of the Upper Nile scenery. The arid
                        desert is replaced by luxuriant verdure, palm groves, or luxuriant swamps,
                        and even the sudd has picturesque floating islands. The popular character of
                        the work is roost noticeable, and tho learned arclueologist and museum
                        authority reveals a totally unsuspected phase in his character. His
                        description of the voyage up the Nile on the ricketty steamer, and his
                        pictures of camp life at Merawi show that he would make an excellent war
                        correspondent, while his descriptions of village life, of strange manners
                        and customs, and his wealth of Sudani folklore show how keen his mind was on
                        all about him.</p>
                    <p>8o far we have dealt only with the popular side of the work, but the
                        archa-ological matter is most important From the Wadi Haifa to the Island of
                        Meriie there is not a single site he did not explore. In the pyramid fields
                        of Nnri he made careful plans, but they had been so destroyed that no
                        definite result*? could lie ascertained. He brings, however, many lacts to
                        show that they were built after those of Egypt of the Early Empire. At Gebel
                        Baikal, the Holy Mountain of Napata, the Ethiopian capital, he explored the
                        temples of Tuhakah and Piankhi. The temple forts on the two ancient
                        frontiers of Egypt were examined. The earliest frontier as now was at Wady
                        Haifa, later it was moved to Semna, and here it was that Usertesen III,
                        about BC 2300 established a frontier force and custom house and formally
                        annexed the country of "the Blacks." At Semna was discovered an unknown
                        temple of Tirhakah dedicated to the Manes of llsertesen III. whom he speaks
                        of as "his divine father," "the good doing God by whom ho is beloved." This
                        shows that this native Ethiopian King looked upon tlie Egyptian ruler who
                        first conquered the Kingdom as his ancestor. So also does ThothmeslII. who
                        ruled the Sudan speak of this ruler. The starting jioint of Sudani history
                        was then about B.c. 2300, and from that point Dr. Budge traces it step by
                        step through the Egyptian rule, the brief Ethiopian Kingdom, the Ptolemie
                        times—tlie rule of the Queens of Meriie — through Greek and Roman, and
                        finishes with the fall of Madhism It is a vast task, hilt it has been well
                        carried out, and the end of Lord Cromer's administration sees a kingdom
                        regained to the oldest of Empires— with ever)- promise of a glorious being —
                        restored to the roll of history by a great Oriental scholar. The
                        illustrations are excellent, some 500 in all, and there is a copious
                        bibliography and index.</p>

                        <p>The "Fortnightly Review" for May contains an article by Mr. Fox-Bourne on
                            "Loid Cromer's Legacy." It is a tepid and unconvincing attempt to
                            persuade us that Egypt is ready for local government. The article is
                            unconvincing because the writer brings no evidence to show that the
                            Egyptian is yet capable of administering laws honestly, justly, and
                            without favour. Mr. Fox-Bourne very unjustly insinuates that Lord Cromer
                            has tried to keep Egyptians out of public life. The very reverse is the
                            case. What Lord Cromer would not do was to give administrative posts of
                            high importance ami responsibility to natives who were unfit to hold
                            them.</p>

                            department, of which, gratifying to note, only 8 were against Europeans
                            To one acquainted with the enormous amount of detail and red tape
                            connected with an ordinary proces-verbal of this nature it is evident
                            that these convictions were no light task. The analysis shows that 13 of
                            the cases were charges of fast driving, 14 of disobedience to the orders
                            of the police, 11 for being minus badges, and the large number of 65 for
                            cruelty to animals: this figure is noteworthy and in connection with the
                            claims of the cabdrivers for an amelioration of the conditions in regard
                            to cruelty to animals it shows that the native cabby resents any attempt
                            to infringe on his privilege of beating his horse. The balance of 282
                            charges were for=genera! infractions of the police regulations.</p>

                        Crommer yesterday on his arrival from Egypt. His welcome was not only from
                        the King and the Government. but from the people themselves It was in no

                        territories of the Sudan, has been commented upon as the greatest work ever
                        accomplished.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that the freedom of the City of London will be conferred on

                        will show how the Sovereign and the Government honour the man who built up

                    <head>THE POST OFFICE ROBBERY.</head>
                    <p>Judge Falqui, the Italian Consular Judge, began the enquiry yesterday into
                        the circumstances attending the theft of registered letters at the General
                        Post Office, Alexandria. The postal employe, who has been arrested in
                        connection with this case, is an Italian subject of the name of Martino He
                        has been employed for two years by the Post Office administration and is in
                        receipt of a salary of L E. 2 per month. The total amount lost is trifling.
                        One of the letters tampered with contained a postal order for£. He took this
                        order, but as the letter stated that it contained an order for £1, as it was
                        found to have been opened and no order was inside, the suspicions of the
                        authorities at the G.P.O. were aroused. Instructions accord- ugly were given
                        to the officials at the casli office to be very careful in the payment of
                        postal orders. A native soon presented himself at the cash office with a
                        postal order for £1. When questioned as to how he had come into the
                        possession of it, lie declared that an employee at the General Post Office
                        had given it to him. The employes' were at once confronted with the native,
                        who picked out Martino as the man. The Italian protested his innocence and
                        stated that he had picked the postal order up in the street, hut lie was at
                        once placed under arrest.</p>

                        of the author's remarks I think it worth while to mention that one day on

                        that I would find the house before reaching the German Column, La Colonne
                        d'Allemagne ; Imagine my amazement ; but I found words to answer that I

                        markets is, in my opinion, due to the fact that the broking houses not
                        having sufficiently appreciated the necessity of giving. English subscribers
                        a larger percentage of shares. They wanted all the profits for themselves in
                        Egypt and now when a collapse takes place they expect the English market to
                        help them, and they find that there is no English market—Truly yours.</p>

                    <head>THE CROMER MEMORIAL.<lb/>ALEXANDRIA AND CAIRO COMMITTEES. </head>
                    <p>The Cairo and Alexandria delegates met yesterday at the Ministry of Public
                        Works view to discussing the form of the </p>
                    <p>memorial to Lord Cromer and his work in Egypt an J to consider the question
                        of joining resources. There appears to have been considerable divergence of
                        opinion and it is reported that the delegates eventually decided not to
                        combine, but that each city should select its own form of monument. As
                        originally suggested by the Alexandria committee; their form of memorial
                        will be a tuberculosis hospital and the Cairo committee have decided upon an
                        orphange.</p>
                    <p>Considerable comment has been caused by the failure of the committees to come
                        to an agreement, but, judging by circumstances and instances of similar
                        contributions to ability and genius by those who live benefited thereby,
                        there seems to be no particular reason Why Alexandria and Cairo should
                        combine The only apparent argument in favour of combination is the question
                        of concentration of funds: this argument is very considerably modified by
                        the fact that in amalgamating funds no. further progress would' be made as
                        to where the money was to be laid out, or where the prospective monument
                        erected.</p>
                    <p>The reported decision of the meeting seems to be very well founded and the
                        idea might be extended very considerably. There are many other towns of
                        importance in Egypt and there is no reason- why each should not have its
                        committee and the residents make up their minds to accomplish something in
                        their own towns as their expression of the value of the great pro-Consul's
                        work, and to which they might point and say "This is our monument to Lord
                        Cromer and his work in Egypt"</p>

                        entertainment deserved, who took the opportunity of witnessing the
                        performance of the Greek magician Melides were we think not disappointed. As
                        an exponent of the occult art he would be hard to beat, and although we have
                        seen some of his illusions in Europe, others were quite new, and the
                        dexterity and completeness of detail, to say nothing of the intricacy of
                        most of the items in his exhibition left his audience in complete
                        bewilderment It would occupy too much space to individualise every number on
                        his programme, but nothing seemed to escape his attention as a means of
                        mystifying those present, from making borrowed watches ring, and change
                        time, pro- lucing bowls of gold fish from a cloth, and bird-cages from a
                        silk hat, down to hatching chickens from eggs on the spot or obtaining wine,
                        which an individual had drunk and would not pay for, from his little finger.
                        But interspersing these were one or two illusions which, although perhaps
                        more simple in operation, were very cleverly arranged. His card trick for
                        instance ; taking a pack of cards, he requests two or three of his audience
                        to select cards, which are then replaced in the pack and shuffled. These are
                        put into a glass jar, and standing some instance of the magician calls for
                        the selected cards, which gradually appear from the pack, apparently quite
                        of their own accord. A clever piece of palming, too, was his coin
                        manipulation, apparently drawing any number of coins from the air, or the
                        pockets of his bewildered onlookers. Another weird illusion, of the
                        spiritualist type, was the placing of two slates bound together upon the
                        table, from which a tapping reply was given as to cards selected, dice
                        thrown, figures written, and more mysterious still the totals of these
                        figures were found written on the inner side of one of the slates from which
                        the tapping had appeared to proceed. As a grand finale to his performance,
                        Melides selects a committee of four and is then secured by meansof tape,
                        seals and screws, to a chair, around him being various instruments. A
                        curtain is then lowered and after a few seconds the instruments are
                        rigorously played and thrown from under the curtain, but this being raised
                        Melides is seen still firmly secured to the chair. A cigarette and wine
                        gloss are next placed on a chair by hisside,the curtain is lowered and
                        raised and the magician sits smoking the cigarette, with an empty glass on
                        the chair. One of the committee then accompanies him while the curtain is
                        lowered, but many seconds do not elapse ere Melides is seen free with the
                        gentleman of thecomtnittee bound in the chair </p>
                    <p>It is to be regreted that this entertainer gave a only single exhibition of
                        his powers as we feel sure larger audiences would have been attracted had he

                        be very satisfactory The Sultan's efforts to improve trade and conciliate
                        merchants are tearing good fruit. He continues to pay his tribute to the
                        Sudan Government with regularity. From all accounts, it would appear that
                        the general condition of Darfouris more prosperous than heretofore. It is
                        stated in the native Press that the Sudan Government has decided to send a
                        military expedition to bring a rebellious tribe to reason, whose members are
                        now terrorising tee inhabitants on the Darfourund Sudan border.</p>
                    <p>In considering the situation in Darfour, the movements of tribes who are
                        followers of the late Sheikh Senussi claim attention. It will be remembered
                        that the great Sheikh Senussi died at Gem on the 30th May, 1902, but in
                        spite of this established fact an idea is prevalent amongst his adherents in
                        the western desert that he is not dead, and early in March 1906 a public
                        declaration was made at Siwa that 'Sidi Mohammed-el-Mahdi' had returned from
                        his secret jolirney to Kufra. On the other hand, it is well known that the
                        body of the late Sheikh lies in a tent at Zawiah-ei-Taj, in the identical
                        shrine which was made for it at Gem when he died. The ready appearance and
                        disappearance of Mahdis is a well-known feature of the cult. The' present
                        Senussi, Ahiued el-Sherif, a nephew ofthe great Sheikh, is still at Kufra.
                        He is reported to be on friendly terms with Mohamed Saleh, the Sultan of
                        Wadai, but the advances he has made to the Sultan Ali Dinar from time to

                        divided into three sections —from Itimbiri to the Uelld (200 kilometres),
                        beyond the Uelld (215 kilometres), from the Uellc to the Nile (50(4
                        kilometres). A great effort will be necessary to establish the first section
                        fButa to Bambili). Twenty five kilometres however, of this section have so
                        far been completed. Beyond the forty-fifth kilometre the land, which is
                        covered with a thick ted of laterite, is firm, and the construction will
                        advance rapidly. On a portion of the route completed light automobiles ply
                        with ease. Two road motors are utilised for the work of construction. The

                        results. It has been decided, provisionally, to organise a regular service

                    <p>The revenue of the Telegraph Department in 1906 was £ E. 104,000. The
                        expenditure amounted to £ E. 90,500, being about £ E. 16,000 more than in
                        1905. Of this excess, £ E. 8,000 was devoted to increasing the salaries of
                        the staff. The number of private tele grams, which passed over the wires in

                        many were unaware that it was to take place.</p>
                    <p>The fide opened at half past three, but it was five o'clock before the ladies
                        presiding over the tombola, pctits-chevaux, buffet, and lottery stalls found

                        varied and each item was well rendered. In the French scenes, the Misses
                        Lillian Cree, Penelope tyanelly and Dolores Passayani deserve special
                        mention. The action songand hornpipe dance were warmly applauded</p>

                        Lillian Cree ami Dolores Passayani rendered their solos most effectively. An
                        exceedingly pretty and graceful skirt dance entitled "Butterflies" was given
                        by the Misses Connie and Freda Hind, who fully deserved the encore accorded

                        successful scholars, and in a short speech complimented Mrs. Hind, the

                    <p>The total sales of land, including those of previous years, areas
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>19,253 2 1/4 feddans.</p>
                    <p>Policy.—As the company now holds only about 10,700 feddans of their original
                        30,000, the policy of the directors is to raise a rent roll from which to
                        pay a steady dividend on the present capital, rather than to diminish, by
                        further sales, the area now held Sales.—Bales have, therefore, only afnonnt-
                        ed to 126 feddans for £6,421, and 53J feddans were also sold on payments
                        deferred over 10 years for £4,204. Some small village plots were sold for
                        natives houses at £70 per feddan Mosque, School and Market.—A further 71
                        feddans has also been sold at a small price, so that endowment for a mosque
                        and school may te provided ; and it is proposed that a cattle market shall
                        be established on land adjoining. Mosque school and market are considered by
                        our advisers to be imperative for the attraction to and retention on our
                        property of a considerable population.</p>
                    <p>During the year 1907 it is proposed to canalize about 2,600.feddans of new
                        land; and in 1908 the last remaining 1,500 feddans thus completing the
                        canalization of all the Abonkir land* ...</p>
                    <p>Mandara Division (4,170 feddanij),—An additional area of 848 feddans was
                        canalwed, and is now being washed. The olderlands -were advanced and an area
                        of 300 feddans - let at £1,412, being an average of, £4- 14S! -pif feddan. A
                        new house lor an assistant is being built, and is nearly completed</p>
                    <p>Wastani Division (3,530 feddami).—Reclamation here has been remarkably rapid,
                        tend after 12 months' washing-give excellent bersoem, and 184 feddans were
                        let at a rising rent of £4. 12s. 6d. per fedda»i'."Th© soil is porous and
                        sweetened more rapidly than any land the Company lias reclaimed, and a good
                        deal of the land in this division is of the same character.</p>
                    <p>Baiiari Division (3,270 feddans).—Ali this land is now canalized, but there
                        still remains some levelling to do 270 feddans were let for £1,350 or an
                        average of £6 per feddan.</p>
                    <p>Tramway.—By the construction of the tramway access to all parts of the
                        property is easy and rapid, and transport is greatly facilitated. Each
                        section of the three lines which join iir the centre of the lands is about
                        five miles in length, giving* total of fifteen miles.- During the whole
                        period of Abonkir-reclamation there has never been such a marked advance in
                        the condition of the lands. This is due to the new syphon which aiding the
                        two syphons built in 1892, hns given good continuous drainage U> all the
                        lands.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the yield of cotton was not equal to the promising appearance of the
                        crop the price was extremely good, at £4 per kantar, the test the company
                        has ever obtained. Pnr- ehnsera of land and tenants arealike contented.</p>
                    <p>Arrears.—Arrears of instalments due by purchasers on the 31st December last
                        amounted to £34,874. 13s 7d . of which £5,000 has been since paid</p>
                    <p>Bourlos Land.—The work on the 1,577 feddans purchased in conjunction with two
                        other companies in the province of Guarbieb has made satisfactory progress.
                        The laRd is all canalized and an assistant's house has beeti built Tenants
                        are coming in freely/and good rents are being obtained. The property should
                        develop into an excellent one.</p>
                    <p>New Share Issue— The Directors wish te record their satisfaction at the
                        manner in which the new issne of 131,870 shares was subscribed for by the

                        <p>Sir, — The discovery of the remarkable sulphur spring at Ilelouan, which
                            burst forth with such violence that it destroyed two houses, coincides
                            in an extraordinary manner with the great eruption now proceedings from
                            the volcano of Etna It is sincerely to be hoped that the officials in
                            charge of the seismiographic apparatus at the Helouan observatory will
                            note this truly remarkable coincidence,—Yours truly.</p>

                    <head>penalty of success.</head>
                    <head>BY SYDNEY BROOKS.</head>
                    <p>But Jeshurun waxed fat, ami kicked ; thou art waxen fat, thou art grown
                        thick, thou art covered with fatnesss; then he forsook God which made him,
                        and lightly esteemed the Rock ot his salvation. Deuteronomy xxxii., 15</p>
                    <p>When the British Empire falls it will be from two causes : One is our
                        increasing interest in its problems ;'the other is our success in solving
                        them This sounds like a paradox, and so it is. I hasten therefore to add
                        that it does not apply to the self-governing portions of the Empire, but to
                        the countries—like Egypt, India, Ceylon, and the Malay States-—where our
                        rule is autocratic or semi autocratic in principle and in fact.</p>
                    <p>If you examine .into the average Briton's sense of Empire you find it to
                        consist of a vague pride of ownership and nothing more. Take, for instance,
                        the case of India. The ''man in the street" is a whole encyclopedia of
                        Indian misinformation. The subject is altogether too vast and remote for the
                        ordinary busy citizen. You will find, if you pump him with sufficient
                        diligence, a few tangled recollectious of Clive and the Black Hole of
                        Calcutta, some more definite convictions as to Mr. Kipling and the
                        dithculties of the Indian Civil Service examina tion a suspicion that
                        Anglo-Indians are overpaid and in the background a vast miscellany of
                        jungles, frontier wars, jewels, tigers, famines, white temples, disorded
                        livers, and Russian intrigues. In other words, he knows nothing about
                        India.</p>
                    <p>1 am not urging this as a reproach. Far from it. I rejoice at the healthy and
                        judicious indifference of our people. It shows that they possess the true
                        secret of Empire. I can imagine nothing mure fatal than that India should
                        become u topic on which every English man felt bound to haveun opinion, ami
                        when I say India I mean, of course, every country in which we are ruling
                        Orientals by ways we do not apply to ourselves. Every Briton for nearly a
                        hundred years has felt bound to have an opinion on Ireland, which is a
                        country not without its streak of Orientalism - and look at the result ! Our
                        national genius for not bothering about the principles and daily detailed
                        workings of our Imperial rule has been the greatest safeguard of the
                        Empire.</p>
                    <p>But there are sighs that this common sense is passing from us, and is being
                        replaced by an impolitic curiosity.</p>
                    <p>When we find in the House of Commons a growing number of men whose
                        consciences will not allow them to lie democratic at home and autocratic
                        abroad, who will never be persuaded that one nation's meat, may he another
                        nation's poison, who regard all men and all societies as equally capable of
                        self-government, who are obsessed by a mania for political prosch tism, and
                        whose instinct is to govern India, and Egypt, and the Malay States on the
                        lines of a somewhat larger Warwickshire, we may be sure Britain is well on
                        the road to confirming Fronde's dictum that "free peoples cannot govern
                        subject races."</p>
                    <p>All democracies sooner or later feel this temptation, and most of them
                        succumb to it There is nothing the French like lielteT than applying the
                        "principles of 17x9" to the natives of the Congo ; and the Americans have no
                        other conception of tropical government than that of dumping upon the
                        Filipinos all the privileges of American citizens and all the paraphernalia
                        of democracy. Even we, though restrained hitherto by the wholesome apathy of
                        our people and by their instinct for trusting the man on the spot, have
                        foisted upon India and Egypt any number of institutions and contrivances of
                        a purely Occidental character —not in the least because India or Egypt
                        wanted them, but simply because we were used to them at home.</p>
                    <p>But there is another and more insidious peril that threatens the Empire, a
                        peril that has been created by our very success. The most pregnant though
                        the least noticed sentence in Lord Cromer's report was that in which he
                        pmtically took upon himself the responsibility for the growth of the
                        Egyptian Nationalist idea "It has been evoked," lie said, "by the benefits
                        which, with a rapidity probably unparalleled in histoiy, have been conferred
                        on the country by the introduction of Western civilisation at the bands of
                        an alien race ;and it is surely the irony of political destiny that that
                        race, or the instruments through whom it has principally acted, should be
                        represented as</p>
                    <p>the principal obstacles to the realisation of schemes the conception of which
                        is mainly due to their own action." Those who will ponder these words and
                        their implications will come very near the heart of the master-problem of
                        Imperialism Stated in Jie broadest terms, that/ problem is the infinitely
                        arduous and delicate one of escaping the penalties of too much good
                        government. We enter these alien countries determined and able to rule them
                        for their own benefit. Wo begin by imposing peace and establishing ordei. We
                        go on to deal out to the peoples under our rule the one novelty that
                        Orientals always appreciate—that of even- handed justice. We pass from this
                        to increasing their prosperity, to educating them, to surrounding their
                        persons and property with innumerable securities. At first the natives, if
                        not grateful, realise at all events that they are better off, and remain
                        passive. Then comes the generation which, having known no other conditions,
                        takes all we have done for it for granted. Meek acceptance gives way to
                        criticism; criticism passes into abuse ; abuse is developed into a demand
                        for some share in directing the administration we have erected. The agitator
                        arises. Each new concession is made a stepping-stone to another. Our own
                        sphere ot influence contracts and that of native opinion expands. The gulf
                        between rulers and ruled grows daily greater ; clouds of intervening native
                        officials swarm between the administrators and the people. Tims the very
                        excellence of our rule provides the means for its overthrow, and its
                        material success implies that we are producing the conditions most
                        favourable to its resistance. ("Daily Mail" over seas edition). </p>

                        <head>SECOND SPRING MEETING.</head>
                        <p>The second meeting of this club look place on Friday last in delightful
                            weather and before a very fair gathering. The special train was somewhat
                            sparsely filled, many of those who had put their names down failing to
                            attend, thereby causing the cljib considerable extra expense, to make
                            good their guarantee. Among the spectators present were noticed Messrs.
                            Webb, Langley, Aspinall, Crawley, Goodchild, Mason, Bakri Bey, Hafiz
                            Bey, Dr. Ekins, Mr. Blomfield, etc. and among those visitors who kindly
                            lent their assistance to the local committee were Messrs. Moberley, G.
                            Way, Hopkins, and Hiles. Owing to an unfortu nate misunderstanding the
                            Adviser to the Interior and Lady Valda Michell were unable to to
                            present, as they had intended. The ladies of Mansoura came in force
                            despite the long and tiring journey. The racing was decidedly good, the
                            starters in each of the eight races rising to double figures, while the
                            fact that the riders wore colours was voted a great improvement. In one
                            race, owing to no one having backed the winner, the pari mutuel
                            performed the somewhat unusual feat of what we understand is vulgarly
                            known as "skinning the goat." The arrange meats again left little to lie
                            desired.</p>
                        <p>The results were as follows : —</p>
