                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.

                    <head>International Comity</head>
                    <p>It is to be deplored that the French Press in Egypt should so often be the
                        mouthpiece of malevolent chauvinism. On Friday last for example, a Cairo
                        French paper iusisted that Germany bad seized npon the events in Morocco to
                        bring about a European conflagration. On the following day it was alleged
                        that the differences between the Shah and his people are being fostered and
                        manipulated by Germany in order to set England and Russia by the ears.
                        Really, such disingenuous endeavours to create international discord are
                        onworthy of those who claim to represent a generous intellectual and
                        civilizing nation. Attempts of this kind, every enlightend man knows, are
                        doomed to failure ; but tbat does not lessen in our eyes the obviously evil
                        intention with which such reports are disseminated. The green-eyed monster
                        is making himself too ostentatiously apparent. This policy of pin-pricks is
                        the outward and visible sign of irrepressible envy at the cordial relations
                        establisbed recently between two great kindred nations which culminated in
                        the dazzling success of the Kaiser's visit to England. That his desire for
                        friendsbip is spontaneously genuine the follow. ing unstudied utterance
                        leaves no room for doubt: </p>
                    <p>"There must be peace between these two countries and I think that the English
                        people will find me the best friend they ever had. We cannot afford to
                        quarrel. I bope I make it clear that my feeling towards England is one of
                        affection "And the expression of this feeling has been re echoed througbout
                        the length and breadth of the Fatherland. "His Majesty's stay in England,"
                        as has been well said, "bag clotbed Anglo-German relations with the warmth
                        and sincerity of mutual goodwill, the influence of which should be long
                        felt." The Englisb man's love of fair-play is proverbial ; and, especially
                        in the light of wat has just happened he cannot view with equanimity the
                        shabby attacks indulged in by the French Press in Egypt or elsewhere upon
                        the German nation. In this month's "Empire Review" an article from the pen
                        of a familiar figure in Cairo, – to wit, Mr. Dicey, - Accurately diagnoses
                        the situation.</p>
                    <p>"The ordinary Englishman," be writes, "s the most good-natured in the world,
                        and when be was ass red that France was willing to shake hands and let
                        bygones be bygones be was perfectly willing to reciprocate the senti. ment.
                        As soon, however, as he learnt that in French opinion the entente cordiale
                        was only a prelude to an offensive and defensive alliance by which Germany
                        was to be deprived of her supremacy as the greatest of Continental Powers
                        the enthusiasm for the Anglo-Prench Agreement dwindled away."</p>
                    <p>Let our French contemporaries take these words seriously to heart. No truer
                        reflection of unanimous British sentiment could possibly be furnished </p>

                        <p>Some inconvenience has of late been caused to the residents in the new
                            Ghezireh Government houses (known colloquially in Cairo as the
                            ''Almshouses') owing to the stoppage of a drain. A native, who was among
                            the workmen charged with the task of discovering the reason for the
                            blocking of the drain, on cleaning it out discovered that a purse had
                            penetrated into the orifice and had effectually stopped the passage of
                            the drainage. As there is no name on the purse and it contains nothing
                            inside sufficient to identify its original owner it is still awaiting a
                            claimant</p>

                    <head>DEPARTURE OF MAHMAL.</head>
                    <p>The final ceremonies connected with the departure of the holy Kiswet were
                        observed with all due pomp on Satorday morning, a vast number of spectators
                        witnessing the imposing spectacle. The best view was obtained from the
                        stand, erected on the further side of the parade ground and exactly opposite
                        the Mastaba, to which access was reserved for those who travelled to the
                        Citadel by the trains of the Egyptian Light Railway, From thence all the
                        preliminaries and actual ceremonies were seen with full effect against the
                        impressive background of the Citadel, with its high walls and rampants
                        outlined by fringes of native onlodkers, and its domed mosque and slender
                        minarets breaking the blue skyline beyond. Long regular Jines of stalwart
                        soldiers bordered the parade ground, while one's eyes were constantly
                        attracted to the Mastaba opposite which was constantly receiving fresh
                        additions to its group of gorgeously attired officials, many of whose gold
                        laced uniforms were crossed with resplendent orders. The entourage of H.H.
                        the Khedive was seen approaching Lancers gay with fluttering pennons of
                        green and scarlet dashed up the sanded roadway below the Citadel, followed
                        by the high swinging carriage with its four horses and scarlet liveried
                        attendants, wherein sat in state H.H. Abbas Helmi II escorted by his chief
                        officials. Soldiers came to attention, spectators rose to their feet, as the
                        massed band struck up the Khedivial march, and the salute rent the air, as
                        Egypt's ruler left his carriage and took his place on the canopied seat in
                        the Mastaba. Then the Mahmal, between two lines of police, and followed by
                        native musicians mounted on their camels moved into position and slowly
                        circled round and round, the glittering top heavy erection swaggering and
                        courtseying at every movement of the slowly pacing camel. Finally it was led
                        up to the steps of the Mastaba where it received the formal benediction of
                        the Khedive before proceeding on its way, still followed by the musicians
                        playing plaintive melodies on their uncouth instruments. More salutes
                        followed its departure the shouts of the menand the shrill cries of the
                        women being heard in the interludes. Then came the march past of the troops
                        of the Egyptian Army, Lancers, Infantry, Mule Batteries and Artillery
                        passing in quick succession to the inspiriting strains of the band, which
                        followed down the road behind them. A few moments after and the Khedive took
                        his place in the carriage and drove across the ground attended by his
                        escort, followed by the Princes and high officials, the closed carriages of
                        the ladies of high rank, the European notables and finally by the long line
                        of heterogeneous vehicles which had been cooped up in the various
                        enclosures</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN CONSTRUCTIONS LIMITED<lb/>EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING</head>
                    <p>The extraordinary General Meeting of the Egyptian Constructions Limited,
                        which was held at the Continental Hotel on Saturday afternoon, terminated to
                        the complete satisfaction of the Directors, the proposed resolutions being
                        carried without serious dissent. The Chairman in his introductory remarks
                        pointed out that the position of the company demanded immediate attention in
                        view of the present serious financial situation, the want of cash being
                        acutely felt, and forcing the company to refuse much good work on account of
                        lack of funds. The only thing required, in the opinion of the directors, to
                        ensure the success of the company, was the raising of additional working
                        capital, and it was with a view to obtaining, this that the following
                        resolutions would be put to the meeting 1. That the capital of the company
                        consist Ing of £200,000 divided into 200,000 shares of £1 each be reduced to
                        £132,750 divided into 265,500 shares of 10 - each AS follows. (a) By
                        cancelling 12,500 shares numbered 5001-7500 and 100001-110000 each fully
                        paid. (b) By reducing each of the 109,500 shares numbered 1-5000,
                        7501-100000 and 110001- 122000 each fully paid from £1 to 10/. 2. That each
                        of the 78,000 shares of £1 each remaining unissued shall be divided into two
                        shares of 10 each. Should the above resolutions be duly passed by the
                        requisite majority the same will be duly submitted for confirmation as
                        special resolutions at a subsequent general meeting of the company which
                        will be held at the same time and place on Wednesday the 8th day of January
                        1908, when a resolution authorizing the directors to sell or otherwise
                        dispose of certain portions of the businesses acquired by the company will
                        also as submitted. With regard to these proposed sales, we were unable to
                        obtain a copy of the statement read to the meeting in time for press to-day,
                        but this will appear in a future issue, but the main features of the
                        proposals are that the company intends to resell to their former owners the
                        businesses purchased respectively from Grant, Bondi and Chinn, Mark T. Boyes
                        and the McClure branch of the business of McClure and Dorling The sale of
                        the former to carry with it an opinion whereby the company would be enabled
                        to repurchase the business within a period of 2 years, on the same terms as
                        those of the original purchase, Mr. Bondi to remain managing director of the
                        company It is proposed to resell the business purchased from Mark T. Boyes
                        for the sum of £4,000, the Company to retain land subject to mortage of the
                        on sale being £8,300. The McClure branch, for which the company paid
                        £18,000, to be sold back to McClure and Dorling for 2,500 shares ; Mr.
                        Dorling relinquishes all rights of directorship, and takes over stock, on
                        the company lost considersably Bad and doubtful debts, estimated at 10
                        written off out-standing debta are approximately £7,045, the heaviest
                        liability of the Company being the Bank overdraft of £20,000 At the
                        conclusion of the statements of the Chairman, M. Wenger requested that some
                        explanation should be given as to the loss on the San Stefano estate, the
                        answer given being that a loss had occurred Sir Horace Pinching remarked
                        that he should like to know the reasons of the general losses sustained. The
                        company were now proposing to reduce their capital and dispose of a large
                        portion of their business and if this continued, as far as he could see it
                        seemed that at the end of 1908, the company would be in much the same
                        position, and would probably wish to dispose of what was left. The Chairman
                        in reply said that the reasons for the proposed reductionus Was that the
                        company was badly in need of capital. The shares cannot be sold at the
                        present rate, and the new issue would make the disposal of shares much
                        easier. Sir Horace Pinching then touched upon the question of dividend of 7
                        which was declared, and which the shareholders had not yet received. The
                        chairman replied that want of funds had prevented the payment of this
                        dividend hitherto, but that it would be paid out of the sums which it was
                        now proposed to raise. He admitted that the company had made a mistake in
                        purchasing first and trusting to raising capital later, a course which the
                        state of financial depression had prevented from realization, to which Sir
                        Horace replied that the company had been started long before the adverse
                        financial position had prevented the raising of any money which was
                        required. After various other questions by M. Biddulph and others had been
                        dealt with Mr. Montagu Summers rose and said that in his opinion the
                        directors were to be thanked for the frank manner in which they had laid the
                        position of the company before the shareholders, and speaking as a large
                        shareholder himself he thought that the proposals which they had just heard
                        were in every way the best that could be made for the benefit of the
                        company. At the present moment the shares were practically unsaleable and if
                        this state of things continued the company would have no other course left
                        it but to go into liquidation, the lack of capital leaving the company
                        almost entirely in the hands of the people from whom the businesses had been
                        bought, but that if the proposed resolutions were carried be did not doubt
                        but what the 10 - shares would very shortly rise to 15/- or even £1. Mr.
                        Hill asked that if the resolutions were carried, what would <cb n="3"/> be
                        left to the company, and also asked how Mr. Bondi could remain in this
                        company as director while competing with it in his own business. The
                        Chairman replied that Mr. Bondi had been good enough to remain in the
                        company and there would be no competition, and that there still remained the
                        head office and the land at Rod el Parag. The Chairman then put the
                        resolutions to the meeting and they were declared carried by a requisite
                        majority on show of hands. Before the meeting broke up the chairman said
                        that he wished it to be understood that the Company had nothing to hide and
                        that any one who wished to investigate its position would be given every
                        information at the offices of the company, and he gave instructions to the

                        all our requirements as Auditors have been complied with. We have to report
                        that the Stock was not taken on the 31st March 1909, except at the McClure
                        and Dorling Branch, the Book figures of the stock being taken of all the
                        other Branches and certified to by the Managers of those Branches. According
                        to the Prospectus of the Company dated 17th February 1906 the total purchase
                        price paid for certain specified assets of the Businesses acquired by the
                        Company was £40,000 of which £30,000 was stated to represent the Goodwill.
                        On examining the Accounts however we found that the Good. will included in
                        the purchase price of £10,000 amounted to £33,446. Subject to the foregoing
                        remarks we are of the opinion that the above Balance Sheet is drawn up so as
                        to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the Company's affairs as
                        shown by the Books. RUSSELL, KERR AND WYATT, Chartered Accountants. Cairo,

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE</head>
                    <p>On Saturday night the Italian Opera company engaged for the season by the
                        Societa Artistica d'Egitto made its début at the Zizinia Theatre,
                        Alexandria, in "Loreley," which will be played again tonight. The impression
                        left upon the audience of this company was most favourable, and by Saturday
                        night's performance we were led to hope for a season of quite good opera.
                        There were certainly defects in the representation, but these may easily be
                        remedied by practice. The most notable fault was a certain raggedness in the
                        choral parts, and the orchestra seemed to us to be at times distinctively
                        too heavy, though we had the misfortune to be almost sitting on the top of
                        the big drum, so to speak. The ballet was clumsy, and the first dance was
                        quite devoid of art — indeed it would have been far better to omit it
                        altogether. Of the principals two shone, and they must have been greatly
                        pleased with the uproarious applause of a most enthusiastic audience.
                        Signora Crusceniski was really good as Loréley ; her voice is clear, pure,
                        and true, and though she is not a great actress she carried out her part of
                        Siren, well. Signor Rusconi too, was good as Rudolfo, but Signor Cristalli,
                        as Walter was rather disappointing ; his voice being rather cold and
                        sometimes even harsh, while his actions were unconvincing. As the fiancée
                        and bride Signora Finzi did not seem quite up to the mark, but she has a
                        powerful and well-trained voice, which she appeared to somewhat overstrain.
                        After tonight's performance, however, of the same opera we shall be able to
                        judge the company better, for on Saturday, first night awkardness was
                        apparent, especially in the chorus. We would impress upon the management,
                        however, the necessity for curtailing the intervals, which were most unduly
                        prolonged and very, very tedious. To-morrow night we are to hear the ever
                        popular "Faust," with Signor Narciso Del Ry as Mephistofele, from whom great
                        things are expected as a singer of much promise.</p>

                        <p>On Friday the 13th the S.S. "El Kahira" took the blue ribbon of this run
                            away from the S.S. "Prince Abbas," by arriving at 7.30 p.m. just under
                            50 hours steaming from Suez; many thanks came from the passengers to Mr.
                            Wayman, the chief engineer, who worked hard the whole time. Among the
                            passengers arriving was the British Consul of Jeddah who went down to
                            Suakim in the vessel and joined the S.S. "Mahallah" for his return to
                            Jeddah, also Mr. Little who left later for Khartoum. On the 14th inst.,
                            the S.S. "Nidderdale" arrived with a large quantity of cargo which will
                            take some days to discharge. Port Sudan is not sorry, as amongst the
                            many passengers there are some good fellows who are fond of sport. We
                            must not forget to mention the Captain who is certainly No. 1 at all
                            games. The Port Sudan Sports Club have got up many matches of both
                            football and cricket for their benefit but I am pleased to say that they
                            have not given us a beating yet, "Well done Port Suddenites." Quite a
                            number of accidents have occurred here lately. One was most serious in
                            which Mr. Cochilani of the firm of Messrs. Bencini and Quistas, the quay
                            contractors, was the victim. It appears that they were blasting the
                            coral reef and this gentleman was standing quite 80 yards away from the
                            scene, when a sharp piece of coral fell on his head, cutting it open. He
                            was carried to his house near by, and the doctors were called in;
                            meanwhile everything was done to keep him conscious. It will be sometime
                            before he is quite well again. Another exciting accident occurred in the
                            shape of a runaway train on a siding where the railways are building the
                            new line to meet the bridge. All the soldiers employed on the work
                            endeavoured to stop it but to no effect, and the soldiers who were near
                            the stop block received not only the contents but the trucks as well on
                            top of them. It was surprising that so few were injured, one only being
                            taken to the hospital. Great alarm has been caused amongst the natives
                            by a motor car, which has just arrived in the "Nidderdale" for the
                            Sirdar who will be shortly visiting the Port. This car is undoubtedly
                            the best that ever put wheels on Port Sudan soil. The makers, Messrs.
                            Arrol and Johnson, are to be congratulated upon turning out such a
                            splendid car, which has been specially made with paddle wheels for
                            gripping the sand. A trial run has been made on another car of the road
                            to Khor-ah-Bat where they intend obtaining the water supply for this
                            town, and which the Sirdar is going out to inspect.</p>

                        have proved fatal, while from Sinope the news is still more serious. There
                        72 cases from the Russian pilgrim steamer "Gregory Merek" were landed in
                        quarantine the other day, and of this number 57 have died. The "Gregory
                        Merek" was allowed to proceed to Port Said, where she is now in quarantine,
                        and she will be sent through the canal under the strictest guard to prevent
                        any possibility of communication with the shore. Cholera has also broken out

                    <p>The coal discharging Arabs have come out on strike in sympathy with the
                        bunkering men who left work without notice on Thursday night. Last Tuesday
                        was really the beginning, as that night a gang of bunkering Arabs on their
                        way to the harbour were stopped by other Arabs who tried to persuade them to
                        turn back. There was a sharp scuffle, but fortunately the police arrived
                        promptly and one of the ringleaders was arrested. The masters of the gang
                        who endeavoured to start the strike requested their sheikh to dismiss three
                        other men who were ringleaders in the scuffle of Tuesday night. Things went
                        on as usual till Thursday evening when a gang was called down to bunker the
                        S.S. "Tydeus." When the gang arrived they were accompanied by the three men
                        who had been dismissed, and then the trouble began. The three discharged men
                        refused to leave the coal lighters and started making a disturbance with the
                        result that the police were sent for and they were arrested. Immediately the
                        men were arrested the whole gang returned to their village and refused to
                        work. The coal agents for the S.S. "Tydeus" applied to the neighbours for
                        assistance but all gangs refused to work till the arrested men had been
                        released and allowed to rejoin their gang. The mounted and foot police from
                        Cairo are encamped in the streets dividing the Arab village from the
                        European quarter and no doubt the sight of so many police will have a good
                        effect on the strikers.</p>

                    <head>SAVOY DANCE</head>
                    <p>Whatever pessimists may find to say regarding the present season, there need
                        be no fear of a slump in the popularity of the Savoy dances, if that of last
                        Saturday may be taken as a sample. It was the cheeriest evening we have seen
                        this season, and was attended by seemingly the entire military contingent,
                        and by the greater part of the residential and visiting population of the
                        place. Varions improvements have been made in the hotel since last year, and
                        the extra door from the ball room, and the increased sitting-out
                        accomodation were highly appreciated by the guests. The new restaurant, too,
                        is a great addition, and its delightful scheme of decoration is bound to add
                        to its popularity; many people took this opportunity of dining and among
                        them being a large party of old Rugbeans who were up holding the honour of
                        their old school. There were as usual a number of handsome toilettes to be
                        noticed in the ball room: the new comers proving themselves every whit as
                        well dressed as those of the past and record season. Mrs. Darrell was a very
                        noticeable figure in a beautiful and most original frock of deep purple
                        chiffon moanted over scarlet satin. Mrs. Appleton, who, has already
                        established a reptitation for always being beautifully gowned, was wearing
                        on this occasion a filmy dress of dark blue with masses of blue sequins upon
                        the decolletage. Miss Schulyer Ross, who is staying at the Savoy with Mrs.
                        Ross, was much admired in a beautifully fitting white satin gown, with a
                        deep lace berthe, and a black ornament in her exquisitely fair hair. Colonel
                        and Mrs. Davidson who have only just arrived in Cairo were present with Miss
                        Davidson, who looked charming in cream net trimmed with bands of satin. Mrs.
                        Hornblower brought her niece Miss Smith also in white, and with Mrs. Royle's
                        party was Miss Barnes Lawrence in a filmy white frock lightly diamantic and
                        inset with heavy motifs of guipure d'Irelande. Princess Irene Duleep Singh,
                        who was in deep rose colour with lace guimpe, was with Mrs. and Miss Carey,
                        the latter looking very handsome in pale pink satin. The Misses Coles were
                        in fresh and dainty pale blue frocks of empire make, the lappels of their
                        bodies outlined by silken ball fringes. Their cousin was in a very handsome
                        frock of white silk, inset with many entredeux and applications of lace.
                        Miss Morss, who is staying with her mother at Shepheards, was quite one of
                        the most popular belles present, and looked very well in a dress of fine
                        muslin much tucked and inset with lace, and with a blue bow in her hair.
                        Mrs. Carver made a very welcome return to the scene of her old triumphs, and
                        looked very well in a pretty frock of soft striped blue material. Mrs.
                        Knight's white chiffon frock guaged round the waist, was weighted by the
                        classical keypattern in gold ; and Mrs. Duffus was wearing a charming gown
                        of grey and white striped silk, over an underdress of soft white muslin and
                        lace. The Misses Hyde Page were wearing handsome satin dresses, one in pink
                        and one in cream, with diamentee lace about the corsages, and Mrs. Parsons
                        was also in cream satin with a soft white feather in her hair. Mrs. de
                        Cossen had a big yellow paradis in her hair which toned with her pretty
                        sparkling drees. Mrs. Nolan was in an empire frock of deep rose coloured and
                        striped material with velvet of the same shade Mrs. Sillards pretty fresh
                        frock was of painted muslin relieved with green and set into a lace yoke at
                        the waist. Mra. Fraser was in brocade of various shades of brown, brown
                        chiflon dividing the panels and draping the bodice. We noticed many dresses
                        in various shades of red and wine colour, one notable one being in velvet ;
                        and among those who wore black with good effect were Mrs. Royle, Mrs,

                    <p>The death occurred recently, at his residence, 33, Great George-road,
                        Waterloo, of Captain William Owen, marine superintendent of the Moss Line of

                        shipping circles. He joined the Moss Line Company in 1866 as junior officer,
                        and rapidly rose to a captaincy. In turn he commanded nearly all the
                        steamers of the line. In 1891 he was appointed marine superintendent of the
                        line, a position he held with credit and distiction up to the time of his
                        demise. His death was not expected, as he was at business a few days before
                        his death. Messrs. R.J. Moss and Co, inform us that he was buried on
                        Saturday, 14th, inst., at Anfield. The House Flags were hoisted half-mast by

                        matinée. Les offres ont oocasionné une nouvelle dépréciation dela cote.
                        Celan'a d'ailleurs rien d'étonnant avec une situation générale aussi peu
                        encoo- rageante, |'élévation du taux privé d'escompte de 5 7/8 a 6% et

                            a very ample programme of work. He landed at Limassol and with Mr.
                            Banbury proceeded to Nicosia by mole across the lower heights of the
                            Southern mountain range. He was thus enabled to gain an idea of the
                            country parts of the Island They remained only one week in Cyprus.</p>

                        <p>Reports from all districts show that the rainstorms of a fortnight ago
                            were very general. [n many localities the land was under water and
                            damage was done. The Railway line to Morphou suffered from wash-outs,
                            the effect, in one part, being very serious, a large portion of the
                            embankment having been washed away leaving the rails and sleepers
                            unsupported. No accidents to trains oncurred however.</p>
                        <p>A railway motor-car has lately been imported for the use of certain
                            railway officials It is intended that it shall travel at a much greater
                            speed than the ordinary train, and will frequently be used in the place
                            of a special train. It shonld prove of considerable utility as well as
                            economy in this respect.</p>

                        <p>The Government farm at Athalassa, which has lately come under the
                            direction of the Committee for the improvement of native animals, has
                            lately received the following live stock from England : 1 Galloway bull,
                            2 Devon bulls, 4 large black pigs, and some head of poultry</p>

                        <head>Cypriot Poultry.</head>
                        <p>There is much room for improvement in the native breeds of poultry and
                            Cyprus is an ideal place for poultry farming. Cyprus eggs compare
                            favourably with the small eggs of inferior quality usually to be seen in
                            Egypt, but new strains of fowls are much needed both for egg production
                            and table purposes. If the use of incubators and foster mothers were to
                            become general, an important and remunerative poultry trade might be
                            done. The price of eggs is at present very high, half a piastre each in
                            the towns, almost the same as in Egypt. Indeed as Egypt comes to be more
                            and more more the market forall kinds of Cyprus produce, the cost price
                            in this Island for such articles will necessarily approximate and be
                            largely influenced by the prices obtainable in Egypt. It may be hoped
                            that when better metbods of rearing poultry prevail here, a more humane
                            system of hawking birds for sale will be adopted. The present custom of
                            tying them by the legs and carrying them about by hand all day is very
                            cruel, particularly in the case of beavy birds. Efforts have been made
                            to introduce baskets and crates, but the existing practise still obtains
                            generally, and will, doubtless, die hard.</p>

                            paid at both the ports for getting from vessel to land is a considerable
                            addition to the travelling expenses, and isa great increase upon the

                    <p>The split in the Navy League has resulted in the formation of a new

                        merchant service. The objects. broadly speaking, of the new society are
                        increase in the sea power of the British peoples, their closer union, and
                        their intra-Imperial organisation for defence. Its specific aims will be the
                        command of the sea as a national policy, since this is the sole eondition of
                        onr national life. The new organisation will also advocate the creation of a
                        Strategy Department and the maintainence of a high standard of naval
                        strength equal to a clear 10 per cent. superiority over the next two
                        strongest navies in the world, with the proviso that the standard may be
                        raised in the event of the international relationships of the British Empire
                        being changed to its disadvantages. Another obeject will be the adoption of
                        legislation with the view of securing the elimination as far as possible of
                        the foreign element in the British mercantile marine, and the improvement of
                        the position and prospects of the mercantile officer and men, without
                        detriment to the British sbipowner, and advocacy of all means which shall
                        tend to unite and simpilty the action of Great Britain and of the younger
                        nations throughout the empire in all matters of detence, sea borne trade,

                    <head>A POPULAR REMEDY</head>
                    <p>WIDE REPUTATION OF DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS</p>
                    <p>La Nolphie, near Sarrazac, is a very small commune in the department of the
                        Dordogne. Nevertheless, Dr. Williams, Pink Pills for Pale People are well
                        known there, as is shown by the letter which M. Prarçois Marty writes:</p>
                    <p>"I chose Dr. Williams' Pink Pills," he states, "in preference to other
                        medicines, and they succeeded in completely curing me. My health began to
                        decline with the return of spring. I became very weak and though I scarcely
                        took any food at all, the digestion of the little that I did eat caused me
                        acute pains. At night I slept very badly, and in the morning I was
                        completely out of sorts. In fact, I came very near to a thorough breakdown.
                        I gave preference to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People when I sought
                        &amp; medicine to remedy my condition, for I had heard much said in their
                        praise. These pills quickly set me on my feet again, and thanks to their
                        effect I have recovered my former excellent health."</p>
                    <p>People speak well of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills alike in big cities and in the
                        most remote villages, as the example cited above, which was taken from a
                        thousand others, simply indicates Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People
                        are a popular remedy-popular because the numerous cures which they have
                        accomplished have created a favourable impression with the public - popular
                        because they remedy rapidly and surely the majority of common complaints -
                        complaints with which at least one person in every family is troubled in the
                        course of the year.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People cure anæmia, chlorosis, general
                        debility, stomachills, nervous weakness, sick beadaches, sciatica, and
                        constitutional irregularities. They impart blood and by giving it "tone"
                        remedy nervous ailments.</p>
