                    <p>Whatever the result, the elections to the German Reichstag which take place
                        today will greatly alter German policy abroad and administration at home. If
                        the Government wins, increases the Navy and Army and a vigorous assertion of
                        German Imperial rights will be the chief consequences. If the Government
                        loses, the advocates of more world-power for the Kaiser will be silenced and
                        the end of "personal rule" in Germany will be well in night.</p>
                    <p>The Government's prospects are rendered cheerless by the fact that the
                        Catholic. Centre on which the Government has for years realised to secure
                        the passing of its Bills in the Reichstag has joined the forces of the
                        opposition. The Reichstag numbers 397 members. At its dissolution on
                        December 13 the parties stood as follows:</p>
                    <p>Centre 100;</p>
                    <p>Social Democrats 81;</p>
                    <p>Conservatives 52;</p>
                    <p>National Liberals 50;</p>
                    <p>Free Liberals, Free Conservatives, Poles, Danes, Guelphia, Anti-Semites, Etc,
                        114. The government is seeking to replace the Centre with a coalition of
                        Liberals and Conservatives, both of which parties are supporting the
                        Government is the present campaign. The Social Democrats, evejn more than
                        the Centre, are the objects of the Government's denunciations. But thet are
                        the best-organised party in Germany, and it is more than doubtful if their
                        numbers can be reduced, especially since the Centre has arranged with them
                        to aboid contests between, the two parties when possible. The issue of
                        to-day's great struggle is thus rendered the more interesting because it is
                        no doubtful.</p>

                        Messrs. Mark G. Boyes and Co., engineers, of Boulac, has also been acquired
                        by the Egyptain Constructions, Limited, as from January 1, 1907. These two
                        well-known firms will be conducted as branches of the company under the same
                        management as in the past. Their acquisition marks an important development
                        Anglo-Egyptian enterprise, and the increased facilities thus afforded to the
                        company for carrying out every description of contracting and engineering
                        works should prove advantageous to all concerened. The phenomenla growth of
                        Messrs. Boyes business during the past few years is the strongest testimony
                        to the satisfactory nautre of their work. Their workshops employ nearly 600

                        Government contracts for the Army of Occupation for the past eight years,
                        and their contract has recently been renewed for another three years. Other

                        augmented by the arrival in Cairo of a futher number of expert workmen.
                        These arrangements will enusre a continuation of the high efficiency of this

                        <p>To The Editor Of The "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir,-I was walking a few days ago in the direction of the new building of
                            the Victoria College, and as I drew near the consruction I noticed that
                            the steel joissts for the college bore the mark of a Belgian firm,
                            "Peiler Walzwark." I conclude therefore that this material I must be of
                            Belgian origin. It amounted in quantity approximately to ten thousand
                            tons. I naturally asked myself how it happened that the material for a
                            college called iinto existence by British enterprise and generosity to
                            commemorate our late Queen Victoria camt to be of foreign origin. I am
                            curious to know who is responbsible for the fact that when the
                            specifications were drawn up it was not stipulated that British material
                            should be used. It is too be hoped that the committee of the British
                            Chamber of Commerce of Egypt will take up the matter, and enquire how it
                            is that the committtee of the Victoria College have been so negligent in
                            looking after such an important point as the construction of the college
                            with the help of British materials. Our own steel joists are recognized
                            to be of the finest material and workmanship. The Belgian-made steel
                            joists are of a plainer characcter and are consequently put on the
                            market at a somewhat cheaper rate. The persons responsible for giving
                            out the contract ought to have been most explicit is indicating that
                            British steel joists were to be used. This is a good example of our
                            listleness in endeavouring to push our own industry, and if there are
                            any business men on the committee of the college they ougt to be asked
                            why they were so remiss in looking after their country's trade
                            interests. Lord Cromer's attention ought to be drawn to the matter.

                            however much our foes may howl us down, it is after all to Great Britain
                            that humanity appeals when hard pressed. Not only in Egypt, but in

                                since the 14th instant. Several buildings collapsed. There were no

                    <head>THE SPHINX.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Alex B. Tulloch writes from Biarritz to the "Globe":- In one of your late
                        issues you refer to the age of the Sphix, or rather I should say to the date
                        of its construction. May I mention that some 20 years ago I sent a short
                        note to the "Egyptian Gazette" suggesting that the Sphinx was the origin or
                        cause of the rection of the Pyramids of the Kinds on the plateua behnd the
                        Sphinx. The general idea is that the Sphix is the oldest known artistic
                        monument in the world, and that it was formely worshipped possibly as a
                        representative of the life giving Nile. If that be really the case, then
                        there would be some reason for the royal tombs being placed always under its
                        shadow, just as in medieval times people of position were buried in the
                        chancels of cathedrals and churches, as near the altar as possible, and
                        those of lesser degree in the body of the church. As the sun's position so
                        to say changes during the year, the Sphinx, which lies to the eastward of
                        the great burial plateau, would have its shadow swept over the whole of the
                        Pyramids and grave chambers to the west of it. I may be and probably am,
                        rather visionary in my idea that the Sphinx is the origin of the Pyramids.
                        Perhaps some of your readers may also have some opinions on the subject. As
                        for the Sphinx having a head-dress or ornament indicating some special
                        dynasty, may not that speciality have been made or altered to suit this
                        reing of some particular king, as Egyptian monuments or records have been so
                        tampered with. In our own coinage the national or Royal arms remain the same
                        on one side, but the head of the sovereign changes.</p>

                        veered to the east, and rain fell at 11 p.m. The morning opens undecided but
                        there is a tendency to rain. An easterly wind is blowing, and the glass
                        remains steady.</p>

                        <head>THE MONEY MARKET.</head>
                        <p>After standing at 6 percent for about 14 weeks, the Bank rate was
                            yesterday reduced to 5 percent. This action of the directors is by no
                            means received with favour in all quarters as, although it will enable
                            traders to get business that is going, it will not have so strong a
                            tendency to attract money to London. In addition to that, there is
                            considerable doubt as to the financial position in America, and pressure
                            for money in that quarter within a month or so is not at all improbable.
                            During the past twelve months the demand for money in America has been
                            enhanced by a number of events, foremost among which must be reckoned
                            the San Francisco earthquake, which absorbed an enormous sum. Then, too,
                            the remarkable prosperity of the country has been a constant drain; and
                            it is reasonable to expect that unless the United States Treasury makes
                            some more serious attempt to give assistance to the market, the Bank of
                            England will ere long be again drawn upon to a considerable extent.</p>
                        <p>There is, however no probabillity of anythinng approaching a panic, and
                            the Bank position is so strong as to preclude the likelihood of the
                            directors being compelled to recur, for some time to come, to a six
                            percent rate, having once reduced it. </p>
                        <p>The Bank return this week again shows a substantial increas in the
                            reserve, which, notwithstanding the extraction of over a million for
                            abroad, is 1,174,000 higher at 22,593,449. There has been a considerable
                            reflux of currency from the country, the stock of bullion habing
                            increased by 508,000. The note circulation shows a contraction of
                            666,000. In consequence of the repayments by the market to the Bank,
                            private deposits are down to 3,125,000 and "Other" securities are down
                            just under 3,000,000. The proportion of reserve to liabilities has risen
                            5.5 percent to 45.75 percent.</p>

                        <head>The Stock Markets.</head>
                        <p>For some weeks past there has been, among a certain of the "House," a
                            constant clamour for induction in the Bank rate and it has been
                            confidently asserted that there would be no improbement in the volume of
                            investment business until such a reduction was made notwithstandiing the
                            fact that a steady advance in the value of securitiees was meanwhile
                            noticeable. The rate has now been lowered, but those members who have
                            imagined that such action on the part of the Bank directors would be
                            followed by a prompt spurt in Stock Exchange business have been
                            disappointed, while those who habe followed carefully the sequence of
                            events in the financial situation, and have made the best of matters
                            during the period of tight money, find their anticipations justified. As
                            we have said before, it is useless to depend upon a substantial easing
                            of the monetary position for an increase in investment operations, and
                            iin the best informed cirlces it is recognised as by no means certain
                            the present ease will continure for nay lenglty period.</p>
                        <p>The announcement of the Bank rate decision yesterday, as we have hinted,
                            had little effect upon markets, which developed a rather irregular tone.
                            Today there has been no sign of improvement; on the contrary, there has
                            been an easing off in several directions. This may probably be accounted
                            for by the fact that in the early part of the week there was
                            considerable buying in anticipation of a reduction in the rate, and the
                            fforts which habe since been made to secure profits upon the news have
                            met with failure.</p>
                        <p>The undertone is nevertheless, sound in all sections, and a return ot the
                            active conditions which prevailed at the commencement of the yar may
                            soon be expected.</p>

                        <p>The easing of the monetary situation, and confident anticipations of a
                            substantial reduction in the Bank rate, appreciably assisted gilt-edged
                            stocks, and Consols have shown a steady rise. Curiously enough,
                            yesterday's decision had little effect upon the premier security which,
                            after hardening 1/16 relapsed to the previous day's price, 87 ¼. The
                            closing quotation tonight fo rthe account is 87 1/8 a loss of 1/8.</p>

                        <p>Russian bonds have displayed strength, despite pessimistic statements
                            which have appeared in some of the newspapers heave regarding the
                            present financial situation in Russia. There now appears to be much more

                            rate among financiers, who doubtless have good reason for their
                            optimism, and it is to be hoped that heir position may be justified by
                            subsequent events.</p>
                        <p>The script of the new Fives is rather easier tonight at 3 3/8 and the
                            Fours at 78 ¼. Japanee issues continue firm, and yesterday the 4 ½
                            perecent. (First Series) further advanced 1/8 to 97 7/8 the Japan
                            Industrial Bank 3/16 to 8, and there was a rise of 1/8 in two other

                        <p>The home railway market has in the main be in steady, though a few of the
                            hsares have displayed a somewhat erratic tendency during the past two
                            days. Yesteday South Western issues, after being irregular, came into
                            renewed favour, the Ordinary advancing a full point to 155 ½, and the
                            Deferred ¼ to 54 ¾. </p>
                        <p>Today the market has been dull, and South Western Ordinary and Deferred
                            declined I, South Eastern "A", 1, while most of the shares have shown
                            smaller losses.</p>

                        <p>The tendency in the American railway market has again been in a downward
                            direction, owing to the continued liquidation in Wall Street. The New
                            York market, as we stated last week, is in a nevous state, hence adverse
                            remours have played a prominent part in the movements, the statements
                            regarding the health of Mr. Pierpout Morgan being a weakening point.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the maket here opened better, and continued steady until the
                            early New York advices came over, but then relapsed. Southern Railway
                            Preference were very weak, losing 7 points to the 88. Illinois Central
                            and Wabash "B" Debeutrues dropped 2, and Chicago Great Western at
                            Louisville 1.5.</p>
                        <p>The American market today has been irregular, but the majoirty of changes
                            are to lower levels.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse</p>
                    <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>THE BERNESE OBERHAND.-INTERLAKEN a favourite summer resort and the best
                        centre for making excursions in the Oberland, abounding in fine walks and
                        views. There is a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the Hoheweg, a fine
                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbath and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
