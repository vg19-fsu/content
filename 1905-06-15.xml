                        of view ever reoorded here. The concession for quick elec trio communication
                        with the city granted at the same time to the two private buyers, a native
                        Pasha and a Belgian gentleman connected with the Cairo trams, will bring
                        this projected suburb within twenty minutes of Opera-square. For years it
                        has been known that the gentlemen at the head of the Cairo trams could get
                        anything from tho Government for the mere trouble of asking, bat the present
                        transaction really beats anything on record. </p>
                    <p>"It will be plain to everyone that the principal losers are first and
                        foremost the Egyptian Government, who could have asked and obtained with
                        ease a sum of at least one million sterling for the land in question. The
                        second to lose by the transaction is very obviously the Delta Light Railway,
                        who have just taken over at a heavy cost the Helouan line in spite of the
                        opposition of the Cairo trams. One can read between the lines, however, and
                        sec that the latter have now attained something towards taking from the
                        English company the laurels so dearly bought by it, which are now ' v this
                        strategical move as good as gone Iready, the new auborb of conree replacing
                        Helonan. The other factors affected by this deal, and by frr the most
                        interesting, will soon find their positi n anything but a pleasant</p>
                    <p>"It is not probable that land on the Nile, as has been hinted, will be mnch
                        depreciated in value—the oity is bound to extend over the river, and if land
                        is now worth L.E. 30 a metre near the Credit Lyonnais, L.K 45 a metre on the
                        Opera square, L.R 20 near the National Bank, and L.R 5 or 6 a metre near
                        Kaar-el-Nil, there is still ample room for profitable investment at
                        Gbezireh, Ghizeb, Embabeb, and Bonlac-Dacroar, especially as the Abbas
                        bridge will very soon span the river. But what opinion are we to form of the
                        British trustee-of Egyptian lands t They have not even the lame excuse of
                        having blundered in favor of British investors!</p>
                    <p>Another Cairo correspondent writes:—"With referonoe to th'q leading article
                        in yonr issue of the 12th inst, regarding the. "Abbassieh Desert^' your
                        surmise is perfectly correct, and I may tell you that I am in a position to
                        state that the fall in the price of land at Abbassieh is solely due to this
                        enormous sale of Government land to a very few people, and at a ridiculous
                        figure. It may bo of interest to your readers * know that several large and
                        bond fide deals ... land at Abbassieh have recently fallen through purely on
                        the grounds that the large sales were whispered tonnd, and if some persons
                        can purchase a few feddans at £1 a feddan, what is the good of paying a mnch
                        greater price per metre t Far better to wait until these speculators have
                        brought the value of ground down to the lowest point But in the meanwhile
                        what are the bond fide land-owners going to do t Calmly sit still and make
                        no effort with the Government to urge them to be just and true in all their
                        dealings, or let the few favored ones bring them to ruin !"</p>

                    <p>American Futures.—The market this week has been decidedly lees active and
                        prioes have experienced a sharp decline, amounting to 15 @17 points from
                        those of last Thursday. Near months have been pressed for sale and show tho
                        largest deoline. The sharp fall in prioes is chiefly due to improved weather
                        reports and to the Bureau report being better than expected, both as regards
                        the decrease in hcreage and also in the estimated condition of the crop.
                        Should the weather remain favorable throughout the month of June, we should
                        expect the Crop to recover much of its present lateness and also to make
                        good muoh of the reoent unfavorable condition. The price of 4id. per lb.,
                        seems for the moment to faifly represent/the situation, and the only (pinion
                        we can form, in a market which is so dependent upon daily Crop reports, is
