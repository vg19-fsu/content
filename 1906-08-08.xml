                    <head>THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>1n another column we published an article from a former English officer in
                        the Egyptian Police on the situation in this country. Th« writer's most
                        important recommendation is that "the sooner small British garrisons are
                        stationed in the big provincial centres, such as Tantab •and Mansourah, the
                        sooner will the Egyptian realize that we have laid our hand to the plough
                        and will not be turned back from the work which we have undertaken." There
                        is much<cb n="6"/> of actual truth in what Mr. Trapmann has to say, and, as
                        a former official of the Egyptian Police, he has the weight of authority and
                        experience to back up his statements.</p>
                    <p>"The days and conditions of the Arabi revolt have long since passed away. The
                        military and legislative measures in force while the Khalifa's flag still
                        flattered over Omdarman are already obsolete. The old Egypt is dead.1 So
                        says Mr. Trapmann with troth "A cause of the gravest anxiety is that the
                        minor native official is not a 'gentleman,' even in the Egyptian sense of
                        the word He writes minutes and files correspondence to earn a living ; but
                        in his leisure hours he reverts to the fellaheen standard of thought and
                        fellaheen associates." Of the omdeh, Mr. Trapmann says: - "That he will be
                        loyal at heart to the Anglo-Egyptian Government in the event of trouble is
                        improbable That Government has done nothing for him, save undermine his
                        influence and to lessen his local prestige. But that in the vast majority of
                        cases the omdehs throughoat the Nile Valley will assist the Anglo- Egyptian
                        Government to suppress all signs of open revolt I do not doubt. How serious
                        a factor their support is likely to prove can best be realized when it is
                        remembered that it is in the villages and little up-country towns that the
                        trouble will hatch out."</p>
                    <p>The necessity of displaying outward and visible signs of the British
                        Occupation in the provinces has long been manifest, and the establishment of
                        small British garrisons in the great provincial towns will afford a
                        -guarantee of security now lacking to the considerable European population
                        who inhabit these centres. With the exception of the very rare occasions on
                        which there is a route march the inhabitants of the Delta outside of Cairo
                        and Alexandria never get a glimpse of the Army of Occupation, and if any
                        fanatical outbreak did occur, all the mischief would be done before any
                        troops could be rushed to the scene of the disturbance. Bat not only is
                        there need of military decentralization. The question of the
                        decentralization of British civil authority is of equal importance. English
                        inspectors ought to reside permanently in the chief town ofeaoh mondirieh.
                        It is argued that such a system would tend to weaken the native authorities,
                        bat we fail to see that such a result would be of much harm in proportion to
                        the immense amount of good which would ensue if efficient Anglo-Egyptian
                        officials were placed permanently in the hospital of every province. The
                        tendency op to the present has been to centralize everything at Cairo, and
                        owing to the ignorance that has thus prevailed as to the conditions of the
                        provinces a somewhat unjustifiable optimism has been the result. Throughout
                        the whole of Lord Cromer's last Report there are no hints of the fanaticism
                        and unrest which are now said to permeate the country. For example, in
                        speaking of the disturbance at Alexandria, his Lordship remarked on the
                        "eminently satisfactory features in this little incident," which were the
                        following: "The first is that the language of the native and European press
                        was, for the most part, very discreet and moderate. But little was said to
                        aggravate the situation. The second is that it became apparent that twenty
                        years of good government has produced one of the results which it was
                        intended to produce. A conservative class, who are opposed to all disorder
                        add disturbance, has been created. Nothing could be more marked than the
                        manner in which all the influential and respectable members of native
                        society at once ranged themselves on the side of order. The danger, inch as
                        it was, came only from the lowest classes of society, both European and
                        native." In concluding his Report Lord Cromer remarks on the fact that his
                        anticipation that the year 1905 would open under auspices of a peculiarly
                        favorable nature for the oasis of Egyptian progress and reform had been
                        realized, and added: "There is every reason to believe that this steady and
                        uniform rate of progress will be maintained in future years.</p>
                    <p>The e words were written only in March last and since then we have had a very
                        disagreeable reminder that everything is not for the best in the best of all
                        possible Egypts. The reason is due to the fact that the atonal conditions of
                        the country have been wrongly diagnosed owing to the continual centralizing
                        tendency to the Government which has permitted a most mistaken optimism to
                        prevail. The fault is common to all bureaucracies. The interest of all the
                        officials is to show that that part of the machine of government under their
                        control is working most smoothly, so those at the head of affairs are lulled
                        into a false sense of modernity. Until Anglo Egyptian officialdom is more
                        decentralized this evil will continue. Tin English soldier and the English
                        official are wanted more in the provinces than even in Cairo.</p>

                    <p>Some of our contemporaries are publishing the advertisements of the Credit
                        Foncier Hollandais, which has every appearance of being a lottery despite
                        the fact that under a recent law snob advertisement were prohibited. In the
                        bulletin of Messrs. De Vries and Boutigny of the 23rd April last we read
                        :—</p>
                    <p>Nou8 avons re^u plusieurs lettres par les- quelles on nous demaode des

                        interdite par le raglement en vigueur depuis l'ann^e dernfere.</p>
                    <p>We understand that on the 5th July last the firm of Melides, as
                        concessionaires of the Credit in Egypt, wrote to the Governor of Cairo
                        asking that the prohibition against certain newspapers publishing the
                        advertisement of the Credit Foncier Hollandais might be withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>The petition was accompanied by a certificate from the Dutch Consul to the
                        effect that a degree of the Dutch Government dated Sept. 22, 1904,
                        authorized the formation of the Credit Fonoier Hollandais. For over a month
                        the Governor has not replied to the Banque Melides, and the result is that
                        some papers publish the advertisements of the Credit Hollandais without
                        being molested, and others to which this publication is prohibited. To quote
                        a Cairo contemporary, " Un pareil dtat de clioses ne peat pas se prolonger

                    <p>The action taken by M. D'Abazzi, the Russian Consul General, and the
                        committee who have so z3alously espoused the cause, not only of Russian
                        Jews, but of Christians also, who have been compelled to flee from their
                        homes, has met with the success it deserved, and the first fete, which took
                        place last 8unday at the San Stefano Casino, added a sum of no less than
                        £1,300 to the funds at the disposal of the committee.</p>
                    <p>The special committee appointed to carry out the arrangements worked hard to
                        bring about this result. Judge D'Abazzi, who has for the last 25 or 30 years
                        been well known and deservedly respected in Alexandria, ably seconded the
                        efforts made by his son, and the result of their efforts combined with those
                        of the committee was shown by the brilliant success of last Sunday's fete.
                        The Casino was crowded, and three bands performed, viz., the Bracale
                        orchestra, the band of the Royal Dublin Fasiliers, and the native band of
                        the Government School. Many dinner parties were arranged, roulette tables
                        were crowded, and several lotteries took place (Charity covered a multitude
                        of sins!). The grounds were brilliantly illuminated, and every nook and
                        corner hi d its occupants. Needless to say, M. Landauer, the manager of the
                        Casino, did everything in his power to contribute to the comfort and
                        enjoyment of those attending the fete.</p>
                    <p>The second fete takes place at the "French Garden," in the Place des Consuls,
                        on Saturday next. We trust that it will be equally successful, and that a
                        further goodly sum will be added to that already obtained. It should be
                        borne in mind that, although most of the refugees are Jews, many Christians
                        are also assisted by the committee.</p>
                    <p>About 40 more families are expected to arrive hereby Friday's steamer. Some
                        of them in all probability will bs sent to Palestine, bat their destination
                        is at present uncertain, and it is possible that all will remain in Egypt.
                        The committee that has done so much solid good work daring the past few
                        months has shown it self worthy of the utmost public support, and we are
                        pleased to find that this is not wanting. The committee did well to make the
                        appeal and mast be greatly gratified by last Sunday's generous response.</p>

                    <p>Captain Lyons, R.E., Direotor General of the Survey Department, has issued a
                        Memorandum on the meteorological conditions in Egypt and the Sudan during
                        July with an estimate of the probable development of the Nile Flood. Captain
                        Lyons says In the memorandum designed in the early part of Jaly it was shown
                        that the rise of the Bine Nile had been somewhat below the average op to the
                        end of June, while a marked improvement bad taken place daring the first
                        decade of July. General meteorological conditions seemed to point to a
                        moderate but not an excessive rate of rise during the month.</p>
                    <p>CONDITIONS IN JULY. Normally rains on the equatorial plateau and on the east
                        coast have greatly diminished from what they were in June and the summer dry
                        season has set in. In the Bahr el Jebel, Bahr el Ghazal, and Sobat basin
                        rains are heavy, as well as on the Sudan plains. On the Abyssinian tableland
                        the rains are heavy, nearly 80 % of the annual rainfall falling in this
                        month.</p>
                    <p>The amount of rain recorded at the principal stations in and around the Nile
                        Basin in July is given in the above table and two principal facts come out
                        dearly ; firstly, excess of precipitation on the equatorial ei.st coast,
                        which has been persistent since the beginning of the year, is now replaced
                        by a deficiency; secondly, the rainfall over the Sudan plains has been
                        somewhat above the average at almost all the stations from which information
                        has been received.</p>

                        bat no report has arrived ; private advices speak of the rains as not
                        unusually heavy. The Khashm el Girba gauge on the Atbara near Kassala shows
                        that heavy rain fell in its upper basin towards the end of the month.</p>
                    <p>The marshes of the Bahr el Jebel rapidly take op day rise caused by the
                        rainfall in the hilly country east of Wadelai and Gondokoro, and at Bor only
                        175 km. from the latter station the river level remains practically
                        constant. It is only the Sobat, the Bine Nile, and the Atbara therefore,
                        draining the Abyssinian tableland, which are of importance at the present
                        time. The Sobat rose steadily throughout the month at a ntftmal rate. The
                        Bine Nile at Roseires rose 5 meters daring the month mostly by small rises
                        until the 22nd, when it rose almost without a Check until Angust 3.</p>
                    <p>It will has seen from the diagrams attached that while the level at Roseires
                        was in Jane below the average of the last six years all of which have been
                        low, it was slightly above it in July, and exceeded it considerably daring
                        the last days of the month.</p>
                    <p>At Khartonm the level was slightly above that of the past six years.</p>
                    <p>The Atbara at Khai-hm el Giiba rose marked by at the end of the month, so
                        that at Wady Haifa the level was bat little below the mean of the l5 years
                        1890-1902 on August 5 and most soon exceed it.</p>
                    <p>At this time of year so far as present knowledge goes, meteorological data
                        from the Nile valley and from the equatorial region afford little
                        information as to the conditions on the Abyssinian tableland, while from
                        this region itself data are most meagre. We are therefore driven to compare
                        the river stage with that of past years. The level at Wady Haifa 15 August
                        WAS 74 cm. below the average of the last J5 years so it is fair to conclude
                        that the level at Assouan will not be above the average till August 10 at
                        least.</p>
                    <p>Referring to past years we see that the level at Assouan WAS below the
                        average 1-5 August in 18 years that only in 3 of these (1891, 1893, 1898)
                        was the flood np to or above the average. In 10 years the level remained
                        below the average till 5 10 August and in all these the flood WAS below the
                        average.</p>
                    <p>The critical period may be said to be the first 10 days of August as the
                        volume of the flood depends on the level attained by the Bine Nile at, say,
                        Roseires being maintained for sufficient time in August. In 1903 the river
                        on August 12 rose to 20.8 meters and then fell slowly throughout the month.
                        In 1904 it rose to 20.5 meters on July 81, then fell abruptly, 18.5 meters
                        being mean for August ($).</p>
                    <p>So far then as information is available it appears probable that the flood
                        will be near the average, but there is not at the present any ground for
                        expecting that it will greatly exceed it. §1) See Physiography of River Nile

                    <head>THE SITUATION IN EGYPT</head>
                    <byline>BY A.H.TRAPMANN (Late Egyptian Police)</byline>
                    <p>Amid all the rumors of unrest that are borne on the air, amid all the
                        prophecies of a possible replica of the Iadian Mutiny in the Nile valley, it
                        is well to pause and consider the present resources and organization of the
                        Anglo-Egyptian Government, and to examine more closely the grip that we have
                        on the land.</p>
                    <p>The days and conditions of the Arabi revolt have long since passed away. The
                        military and legislative measures in force while the Khalifa's flag still
                        fluttered over Omdurman are already obsolete. The old Egypt is dead. The
                        Egypt of to-day is a reincarnation in its adolescence and like all things
                        young, it grows at a tremendous pace. The administration has been obliged to
                        alter and expand rapidly in order to keep pace with the phenomenal
                        growth.</p>
                    <p>Modern Egypt is nominally governed by a Cabinet of native Pashas, who draw
                        large salaries; but actually these have but little voice in the management
                        of affairs. The reins of Government are really in the hands of a few English
                        officials who modestly style themselves "advisers." Each native Minister has
                        an English adviser, whose function it is to see that the "advice" which he
                        tenders is duly accepted and acted upon. This policy is pursued throughout
                        the whole administration so far as finance permits; but necessarily in the
                        lower grades and positions the Treasury cannot bear the strain of
                        duplicating the appointments. The result is that minor officialdom is but
                        sparsely sprinkled with a leaving of Englishmen. Outside Cairo and
                        Alexandria affairs are almost entirely in the hands of the native official,
                        if one excepts the technical departments, snob as the irrigation
                        service.</p>
                    <p>A cause of the gravest anxiety is that the minor native official is not a
                        "gentlemen," even in the Egyptian sense of the word. He is merely a more or
                        less educated native. In his spare hours he associates with the men whom in
                        office hours he helps to govern. His ambitions, aspirations, mode of living
                        are the same as those of his less educated compatriot. He writes minutes and
                        files correspondence to earn a living; but in his leisure hours he reverts
                        to the fellaheen standard of thought and fellaheen associates.</p>
                    <p>This is the man who is fostering the spirit of revolt in the country; and in
                        the event of trouble he would throw in his lot with the great uneducated
                        mass of the peasantry in the hope that his literary qualifications would, in
                        the event of success, earn him a lucrative position under the new form of
                        government. Luckily for the most part these men are dreamers of dreams only,
                        and not men of action, nor with any capacity for organization. They may be
                        unfavorably compared with the "Baba" of India. It is their number and
                        occupation rather than their individualism which render this class such a
                        menace, including as it does practically the whole educated population of
                        Egypt, from the junior officers of the army and police to the up-country
                        **stationmaster; from the schoolmaster to the War Office clerk.</p>
                    <p>So much for the civil element of the native governing class. The Omdeh, or
                        village headman, is deserving of separate mention. The Omdeh is a relic of
                        the old regime. Illiterate, and supremely indifferent to the world at large,
                        he does not impress the casual observer favorably at first; bat he who looks
                        beneath the surface will detect a virility and a directness of purpose which
                        compensate for the lack of more subtle virtues. I have known many of these
                        Omdehs. Some I have found Djnst, cruel, overbearing; but I have never yet
                        found one who was not eminently capable to rale the people in his own
                        village—and that with a hand of iron.</p>
                    <p>One of the results of the present regime is that the Omdeh finds himself
                        responsible to— and is obliged to "Kow-Tow" to—the little circle of native
                        clerks who idle away their days in the offices of the Provincial Governor.
                        These in his heart of hearts he desires. He holds them in about as much
                        affection as the soldier is able to cultivate for the War Office clerk who
                        is responsible for supplying Dim with brown paper boots.</p>
                    <p>That the Omdeh will be loyal at heart to the Anglo-Egyptian Government in the
                        event of trouble is improbable. That Government has done nothing for him,
                        save to undermine his influence and to lessen his local prestige. But that
                        in the vast majority of cases the Omdehs throughout the Nile Valley will
                        assist .the Anglo-Egyptian Government to suppress all signs of open revolt I
                        do not doubt. Though simple-minded and undefeated they are perfectly aware
                        on which side of the bread the batter is likely to be found when all the
                        trouble is over, and for that reason alone they will throw the tremendous
                        weight of their influence into the scale of British supremacy.</p>
                    <p>How Berioas a factor their support is likely to prove can best be realized
                        when it is remembered that it is in the villages and little op* country
                        towns that the trouble will hatch out. The inhabitants of Cairo and
                        Alexandria may perhaps follow in the footsteps of insubordination, though
                        even this is extremely doubtful, but they certainly will not lead the
                        movement. Let me here call attention to the fact that the 4,000 British
                        troops NOW in Egypt proper are distributed between the garrisons cf Cairo
                        and Alexandria; and that if troubled bloodshed were to occur in a day
                        provincial district there would be cot one single British bayonet to enforce
                        order.</p>
                    <p>The isolated and scattered British officials and their families who live
                        outside those two great towns would indeed be in great jeopardy in the event
                        of a general rising. The provincial police would be powerless, and probably
                        unwilling to protect them. Their only hope would be to make for one of the
                        coastguard stations and trust to the gallant.—and indubitably loyal—Sudanese
                        from which this floe service is recruited, to defend them and convoy them to
                        a place of safety.</p>
                    <p>The sooner small British garrisons are stationed in the big provincial
                        centres such as Tantah, Mansonrab, Zagezig, etc., the sooner will the
                        Egyptian realize that we have laid our hand to the plough and will not be
                        turned back f om the work which we have undertaken, and then—and then
                        only—will real peace and security come upon the land, ('Daily Graphic,")

                    <p>A curious accident happened this morning at the sea-baths belonging to the
                        San Stefano Hotel-Casino. A well-dressed lady, apparently an Oriental, went
                        to her private dressing-room prior to taking a bath. While the lady was
                        inside the floor of her dressing-room gave way and she was precipitated into
                        the sea fully dressed. Fortunately the sea is not very deep at this point,
                        otherwise the accident might have had serious consequences.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the accident occurred a scene of extraordinary excitement ensued.
                        Ladies in scanty raiment rushed about screaming in various languages.
                        Luckily, a young girl, who was elegantly and folly dressed, plunged into the
                        water and rescued the distressed lady.</p>
                    <p>The panic was so great that a number of ladies refused to bathe. It is to be
                        hoped that this incident will induce the management to the San Stefano
                        Casino to carefully inspect the structural arrangements of their baths.
                        Wood, owing to the action of salt water, quickly deteriorates, and it is
                        most essential, in the interests of public safety, that such accidents
                        should be guarded against.</p>

                    <p>Messrs. Lake and Carrie, the Nile Valley company*8 engineer, report as
                        follows: — The total footage for the month ended 30th Jane.1906, amounted to
                        114 fr. The main shaft (No. 5) was sunk 17ft 6in to 276ft 6in and No. 1
                        shaft 16ft 6ins to 295ft 6ins. The third level is at present being opened up
                        by means of divers from the bottom of W icze B.N. 1. The north drive is now
                        in 40ft, and the south drive 39 ft. In the former the lode averages over 2
                        ft in width, and value of 17.1 dwts, whist in the latter the width in about
                        1 ft, with an average value to 13 dwts. This refers to the distances driven
                        during the month of June only. The average widths and valnea over the entire
                        distance driven on the third level—namely, 79 ft—are as below:—North drive,
                        width 21 ins, value 21.1 dwts ; sooth drive, width 13.8 ins, value 21.9
                        dwts. Driving north and south has also been commenced from the bottom of
                        winze B.S.l. at the 320 ft, or third level. Shaft No. 1 is rapidly
                        approaching the third level. As soon as the requisite depth is attained,
                        driving will be pushed on both north and south. Daring the month only 160
                        tons oi ore were rushed, yielding 95 o*s of amalgam, and the battery has now
                        been shut down pending the development of additional ore reserves. This has
                        enabled the management to concentrate all their energies underground, and as
                        a large number to new faces have been got to work the footage for July
                        should be considerably in excess of June.</p>

                    <p>REPORT FOR 1905</p>
                    <p>The report of Coles Pasha on the Prisons Department of the Ministry of the
                        Interior for 1905 has just been issued. The following extracts from the
                        report will be of interest:—</p>
                    <p>100,822 persons were committed to prison daring the year, being 94,516 males
                        and 6,306 females compared with 96,229 males and 9,990 females daring
                        1904.</p>
                    <p>The number of prisoners committed "Before trial" and "By Irrigation Courts"
                        shows a considerable increase.</p>
                    <p>Irrigation Courts,</p>
                    <p>As regards the Irrigation Courts, it is explained that owing to the shortage
                        of water daring the early summer, rotation regulations had to be strictly
                        enforced and a larger number of persons were prosecuted than usual. This may
                        be the case, bat when in one Mark /. (Santa) 697 persons are imprisoned and
                        in the adjoining Markaz of Z|fta only 63, it would appear that some special
                        supervision is called tor to ensure the regulations being uniformly applied.
                        In fact there seems to be no sufficient reason why this and similar
                        Administrative Coart9 should not now be all abolished and the offences
                        hitherto dealt with by them prosecuted before the Markaz Tribunals. The
                        Decrees constituting these Administrative Courts dearly contemplated
                        expedition in the disposal of the cases; yet it is not unusual to find
                        persons undergoing imprisonment in the autumn, if not later, for petty
                        offences committed in the early summer.</p>
                    <p>Sentences.</p>
                    <p>68,318 males and 5,509 females were sentenced to imprisonment during the
                        year, compared with 73,095 males and 8,650 females sentenced daring 1904. Of
                        the prisoners sentenced dating the year 1,107 were sent to penal servitude
                        (527 in 1901), 148»to detention (150 in 1904), 21,392 to imprison meant with
                        labor (21,958 in 1904), 34,383 to simple imprisonment (34,278 in 1904), and
                        16,776 to imprisonment in default (24,825 in 1904). It will thus be teen
                        that the total decrease is accounted for by the diminution in prisoners
                        sentenced in default, being 8,049 less than during 1904. Penal servitude
                        prisoners on the other hand have increased considerably.</p>
                    <p>Executions.</p>
                    <p>Twenty men were executed during the year against 7 in 1904. These executions
                        now all take place in private, a special execution room having been built in
                        each prison. Those only who have assisted at public executions in Egypt can
                        appreciate the remarkable change these private executions have brought
                        about. The representatives of the Press are admitted, but a paragraph in the
                        Arabic paper is the usual record. In fact a few minutes sacrifice for the
                        whole ceremony and the condemned man himself is kept in ignorance of the day
                        and hour till he is waited on by the hangman. There are many who maintain
                        that executions in Egypt are now too civilized and that a public example is
                        necessary. Executions, whether public or private, have had, as far as one
                        can judge, little effect, for murders are, if anything, more numerous than
                        they were twenty years ago.</p>
                    <p>Sentences awarded by Courts.</p>
                    <p>There is an interesting return in this year's report showing the sentences of
                        imprisonment awarded by each Court separately. Judging from this return the
                        Courts of Assiout and Beni Souef deal with their criminals with greater
                        severity than elsewhere; on the other hand the Alexandria tribunals have
                        sentenced comparatively few to long terms of imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>Labour Homo for Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria, as in previous years, shows the largest percentage of
                        re-convictions of juveniles from reformatories. Alexandria would thus appear
                        to be the most suitable place to start a "labour home" where discharged boys
                        could be received and better supervised. The present system of asking the
                        local Cover nor or Moudir to interest himself in obtaining work for a
                        discharged boy does not always prove satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Escapes</p>
                    <p>Sixty-three prisoners escaped during the year; of these 39 were re captured,
                        leaving 24 still at large. Amongst the escaped prisoners accounted for
                        during the year was a man who was such an exceptional criminal that his
                        death calls for a short obituary notice</p>
                    <p>In 1900 Shehata Ibrahim was one of a police guard on the Alexandria Prison ;
                        while* on guard he succeeded in breaking into and pillaging the prison store
                        and, to avoid detention of the theft, bet fire to the building. He was
                        arrested but whilst in prison awaiting trial, he, with the connivance of one
                        of the guard, a former comrade, succeeded in escaping. Shehata was next
                        arrested in 1901 in the Gharbieh Moudirieh charged with robbery and murder
                        and sentenced to death. In 1902, whilst at exercise in the courtyard of the
                        Cairo Appeal Prison, he succeeded in escaping by scaling a wall in the face
                        of an armed sentry. In December 1905 he was shot dead by a village policeman
                        whilst committing a gang robbery in the Gharbieh Moudirieh. Modern methods
                        of penology are wasted on such a criminal, and it is to be hoped for the
                        sake of the community that there are not many men of this description in
                        Egypt.</p>

                    <p>Conclusion</p>
                    <p>Coles Pasha concludes as follows :— In concluding this report, l would take
                        the opportunity of reminding all officers, more especially the Directors of
                        Prisons, that, although much has been accomplished since the loosening of
                        the purse strings made Prison Administration on civilized lines possible,
                        their ta>k is by no means complete It is not unusual for inspecting officers
                        when reporting some irregularity to qualify their remarks by implying that
                        with Egyptian officers in charge of prisons nothing more can be expected.
                        Now I venture to differ from such observations, and I may say I expect quite
                        as much, if not more, from my Egyptian subordinates as I do from Europeans I
                        will go further and say that Egyptian c liners have, in many respects,
                        proved themselves superior to Europeans; they often, in fact, undertake and
                        carry oat work the difficulties of which appear immemorable to their
                        European comfreres. </p>
                    <p>Where many Egyptian officers fail is in the enforcement of discipline, and
                        they do not always pay the necessary attention to matters of daily routine.
                        As an instance, if silence, throughout a prison, can be at once obtained by
                        a warning bell on the arrival of an inspecting officer, th9 hum of voices so
                        often heard t.om outside a prison can easily be prevented. Again, with the
                        subordinate staff, I fear that the tendency is to overlook irregularities,
                        provided that there are no complaints and prisoners "play up" to the warning
                        bell. A prisoner thus treated naturally resents the unexpected enforcement
                        of a rale and a major offence has often to be reported in consequence.</p>
                    <p>For many years so many glaring abuses and faults had to be remedied that what
                        I may term the niceties of prison administration were perhaps overlooked. It
                        behooves all officials, therefore, not to rest satisfied by comparing the
                        present with the past; but, year by year, t) perfect their administration
                        till there is little to find fault with. With prisons over- crowded as at
                        present, I admit the task is not an easy one, and standing orders in the
                        matter of accommodation must perforce be occasionally ignored. But in other
                        respects regulations should be strictly adhered to, and in the matter of
                        discipline especially, directors should actively supervise the work of their
                        subordinates. Unless discipline be severe, prison life ceases to be
                        deterrent to the ordinary Egyptian prisoner.</p>

                    <head>JAPAN'S COTTON TRADE</head>
                    <p>The American Consul at Kobe, writing to the Department of Commerce at
                        Washington, U.S.A., says that raw cotton forms the largest single item of
                        import into Japan, its manufacture being also the most important industry.
                        He continues:—"Japan having seen that Great Britain, though not a
                        cotton-producing country, spins and weaves that staple for about 50 per
                        cent, of the people of the world, and having seen that many of the
                        conditions in the two countries are parallel, no doubt wishes to profit by
                        the example of her prosperous ally. Thus cotton mil's have been established
                        throughout this country, more part salary in the Kobe district, and in these
                        American and other cottons are transformed by cheap labour into fabrics
                        which not only go towards supplying the home demand but in certain lines are
                        also largely exported. The quality of the cotton is mostly middling and
                        interior, of which the greater part comes from British India, America, and
                        China, in tbs order named, while Egypt supplies the relatively endless
                        amount required for the higher-grade yarns. Yarn for home consumption is
                        composed almost entirely of American cotton, but in that for export it is
                        mixed with others to the extent of from 10 to 20 per cent.</p>
                    <p>"With reference to the future development of the cotton spinning industry,
                        there is a noticeable tendency toward the absorption of the smaller mills by
                        tin larger ones, and also toward the utilization of water power for the
                        generation of electricity as a substitute for steam. There is little doubt
                        but that the importation of raw cotton into this country will increase
                        largely in the near future on account of the efforts being made to extend
                        Japanese trade in cotton yarns and woven goods to the Asiatic Continent,
                        especially if the relatively high price for yarn and low price for cotton is
                        maintained."</p>

                    <head>A WARNING TO TAVELLERS</head>
                    <p>So many residents in Egypt make use of the P.L.M. line from Marseilles to get
                        to London and Paris that it is worth while noting for their warning a
                        remarkable case of up-to-date brigandage of which an English lady was the
                        victim, which is yet one more tale to tell of train robbery between London
                        and Marseilles. An English lady, Mrs. Gardner, arrived at Charing Cross, on
                        Wednesday week, to find that her dispatch box bad been looted of several
                        hundred pounds' worth of jewelry and X40 in cash. Time was when the
                        highwayman and the 1 rig and adopted different methods of »operation ; but
                        "autre temps, autre nconrs," *and now the train robber is the natural
                        successor of M. Claude Duval and Signor Luigi Vampa. A corridor train has
                        the great advantage, for the traveler, that you can walk out of your
                        compartment whenever you like but unfortunately there is the disadvantage
                        that anybody else can walk in. On the whole, we should think it would
                        generally be after, at least on the French liues (we tay uoth'ng whatever of
                        the Italian), to include nie's valuables in one's registered luggage,
                        ri8tead of carrying them in a portable box or bap Furthermore, the P.L M.,
                        and the Nord, which are responsible for the great pleasure highway through
                        France to Southern Europe, might well bestir themselves to exercise a rather
                        more careful surveillance of their passengers than they have hitherto
                        done—at least, if we may judge from results.</p>

                    <p>Lieutenant F. J. M. Postlethwaite, 2nd Battalion Kin g's own Light Infantry,
                        Sheffie'd, who is taking service under the Egyptian Government, has held a
                        commission in the K.O.L.I. since January, 1900, and has the reputation of
                        being a smart young officer, of whom more will be heard.</p>
                    <p>To Captain C. Pierce, 1st Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment, belongs the
                        distinction of being the champion military shot in Ireland he having secured
                        that honour at the A!' Ireland Army Rifle Mesting at the Carragh in the past
                        week. In the grand aggregate he stands first with a score of 124. Launce
                        Sergeant Harrison, 1st Royal Berk*, was second b sf shot. Sergeant J. M.
                        Reid, Colour Sergeant Doe, and Captain Macdonald, same battalion, took 14th,
                        16th, and 17th place respectively. The team of the Royal Berks had no
                        difficulty in carrying off the Lord II berts Cap with the score of 661.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant A. J. F.aser, 1st Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment, Dublin, has
                        been transferred to the 2nd Battalion at Khartonm, and will remain with the
                        1st Battalion till the coming trooping season, when In will embark for
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>It is not expected" that the home battalion of the Royal Berki will send out
                        any draft daring its stay in Egypt, owing to its near departure for
                        India.</p>
                    <p>Recruiting forthe Northumberland Fusiliers, Royal Wjiwickshire Regiment
                        Lancashire Fusiliers, and Manchester Regiment, the 3rd and 4th Battalions of
                        which are to be rendered, has been stopped.</p>
                    <p>Recruiting all round shows a little improvement. This usually follows the
                        close of the militia training season, when a good deal of volunteering to
                        the Line takes place.</p>
                    <p>"To what base uses we return " I The old battleship Alexandra, which was
                        prominently engaged in the bombardment of the defenses of Alexandria, 11th
                        July, 1882, is about to be converted into a coaling hulk. The Alexandra was
                        ordinarily the flagship of Sir Bsauchamp Seymonr, commanding the British
                        fleet, but he shifted his flag just before the bombardment to the battleship
                        Invincible, which drew less water in the harbour. The Alexandra threw 407
                        shot and shell, exclusive of 4,0C0 rounds of Nordenfeldt and 340 rounds from
                        her Gatling gone. In return, she was struck from the forts over sixty
                        times.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, the Imperialists may be thankful that the present
                        Administrator, in its worship of the fetish economy, did not smash up the
                        entire shipbuilding programme of its predecessor. In the House of Commons
                        yesterday, in Committee of Supply on the Navy Estimates, Mr. Roberstson
                        stated that the ship building programme would include three battleships of
                        the Dreadcought type, two ocean going destroyers, eight submarines, and
                        twelve coast destroyers. Instead of the four Dreadooughts. five ocean
                        destroyers, and twelve submarines proposed by the late Government. A fourth
                        Dreadnought would be projected in the event of the Hagne Conference oncoming
                        to a satisfactory conclusion. The Government hoped to sav* nearly a couple
                        million pounds. The preje it was severely criticized by M-. Balfour.
                        Eventually the vote was agreed to.</p>

                    <head>NEW INDUSTRIES AT NAPLES</head>
                    <p>in a supplementary report on the trade and commerce of South Italy for the
                        year 1905 Mr. Cuniul General Ro'fe stated that the law of July 8. 1904,
                        under which ground and motive power are granted almost Dee arc! exemption
                        from duties and taxes allowed for ten years to manufacturers who will
                        establish up industries or enlarge existing ones at Naples, is beginning to
                        show important results. Over 504,000 square metres (about 100 acres) have
                        already been taken ap, and very important works are rising upon the ground.
                        The two important companies for the manufacture of textiles, the
                        Lombarda-Napoletana and the Lignre-Napoletans, both, as their names import
                        having their origin in Northern Italy, will give employment to 3 00)
                        operatives; the Sinigallia silk works will rival the Caserta works in
                        importance ; the Valsano sogar retiary has transformed its mills from Segni
                        and is erecting works on a much larger scale at Naples ; the railway
                        carriage works of Dialto and Benvennti, to whom Government contracts are
                        seen red by tin law, have taken up a large amount of ground, and the
                        extension of the yards of Miani and Silvestri, who purchased the works and
                        plant of the British fi-tn of Hawthorn and Gappy, and have largely I
                        ircreased them, as well as a faotory for canning I fruit and vegetables, are
                        among the chief pioneers of the new industrial movement. Some ^ 50 other
                        applications have reached the authorizes, aid these will all have attention
                        as soon j as it is possible to expropriate the present , owners under the
                        law of 1885. All this means that the ground devoted to industrial expansion
                        his proved much too limited for tin candidates; who are willing to take it
                        np ; but as the law applies Dot only to the free zone as at first
                        instituted, but to all the land which is included in the municipal area, it
                        is clear that a very considerable amount more will have to be expropriated
                        before the investing public is •satisfied. Now there lies to the west of
                        Naples a considerable plain which extends from the hill of Posilipo, a great
                        part of the way to Pozzloli, and enjoys a good anchorage, easily convertible
                        Into a capacious harbor. Here the Terni steelworks have already taken up
                        000,000: square metres (about ICO acers) for the erec- tion of works. Here
                        also a firm is setting np works for the making of elevators, and no J doubt
                        the industrial importance of this plain, will rise considerably as soon as
                        it is connected by rail with the eastern side of the town, and with the
                        whole Italian railway system, from which it is at pretext cat elf by the

                    <head>THE PARADOX OF INDIA</head>
                    <p>The paradox of our Government of India is will illustrated by Mr. Sidney Low
                        in a parable in his new book on India. Imagine, be say q that the Japanese
                        had conquered all Europe, including the British Isles. In Wales there would
                        be schools for Welsh and English; newspapers in both languages; Methodist
                        ministers, Church of England parsons; Welsh and English Judges with
                        barristers and attorneys, mostly Welsh, practicing before them; Welsh
                        m'r.e-s hewing coal in the Rhondda Valley ; London financiers exploiting
                        Swansea and Cardiff : — "There might be a Japanese regiment at Chester, and
                        a cruiser flying the chrysanthemum flag acting as guardship off the Severn.
                        Bat beyond a few traders there are no Japanese residents at all, save and
                        except a Mr. Hayashi or a Mr. Inaga, who is the principal administrative
                        officer of the province, with a couple of young Japanese assistants, a
                        Japanese police commandant, and a Japanese chief judge. Imagine, farther,
                        Mr. Hayashi or Mr. Inaga ruling from an extremely modest country house
                        somewhere in the mountain valleys, an I assume that he has no Parliament or
                        local Assembly to control him, but receives his orders direct from the M
                        kado's Cabinet at Tokio, or from a Japanese Government of Europe, with its
                        seat at Berlin or Vienna. Imagine all thi3, and you get something like the
                        miraculous condition of things that pre vails in British India at this
                        moment of writing. ' In his concluding chapter Mr. Low raises the old
                        qa3stion as to the endurance of this strange mode of government. On the
                        whole, he is optimistic, and ha h is one argonaut which is well worth
                        consideration:— "1'ho point that differentiates our rule from that of any
                        Eastern dynasty is that we are migrants, not settlers. It is to some extent
                        an element of weakness; but it is also the prime and main source of our
                        efficiency and strength. In all the other cases, the masculine conquering
                        race has suffered that deterioration which Seems, as if by law of nature, to
                        overtake every despotic monarchy in the East. The Moghuls might be masters
                        of India to this hoar if they could have bred a succession of Babers and

                        <p>In South Africa another factor comes into play which did not affect the
                            situation in the United States, that of the existence of a difference of
                            race, of civilization, of political ideals, between Briton and Boer.
                            That closerr unity of the Empire to which we aspire, alike in the
                            interests of the security and welfare of each component part and in the
                            general interest of humanity, must depend for its living force upon the
                            spiritual affinity between the free communities which compose it. The
                            substitution in the great sob continent which forms the very keystone of
                            the Imperial arch of a polity based on the principles of Krugerism in
                            place of progressive democracy, embodying English and Dutch alike, but
                            based on British principles of government, would mean a break in that
                            affinity which neither fiscal nor constitutional unification could
                            surmount. ("Times.") </p>

                        <p>When (Jarmans scoff at Mr. Haldane's method of making an army by the
                            inimitable martial expedient of counting the Militia twice over, when
                            they point out that disarmament will be impossible until there is a much
                            more equal division of international property, it may be well to note
                            that their opinions are based on experience, and to remember what their
                            experience is worth. They have always been on land what we are and were
                            on sea. They are the most central of Continental nations and the most ex
                            posed; prepared for offence towards every point, because open to attack
                            from every quarter's hardest lessons of history have been theirs. . ..
                            They won peace with unity by their strength. By their strength they hold
                            it. They know that to relax their defenses would be to condemn
                            themselves for ever to a subordinate role among peoples. They aspire, as
                            their achievements, their ability, and their numbers justify, to a
                            future second to none ("Telegraph.")</p>

                        <p>How little the expenditure of over six million sterling a year resembles
                            disarmament may ne gathered from the fact that no other country spends
                            nearly so much. Thanks to the industry of previous years, England is so
                            richly provided with naval equipment that she can easily afford to
                            masquerade as a 'disarmer' for a single twelvemonth. ("Deutsche Tages-

                        <p>Unfortunately for Europe, the special position of England, fortunate as
                            it is for her, deprives the good examples inspired in her by her lofty
                            conception of her duties to civilization and humanity of all value as a
                            demonstration. Such examples would have to come from another quarter,
                            whence no one expects it, for in that quarter the notion of lofty duty
                            is quite another thing. ('Sicole.") </p>

                            Britain is an island, France a Continental Power. With smaller resources
                            and greater risks we cannot favour a limitation of armaments as can the

                        <p>A duel is proclaimed between Great Britain, who desires to remain
                            faithful to commercial freedom loyally interpreted, and Germany, who
                            constitutes in Europe the fortress and citadel of the new protectionism.
                            Is France perhaps in a position to pave the way to a pacific settlement
                            of this conflict?</p>
                        <p>There is only one line for France to take—to attach ourselves more
                            closely to Great Britain, who alone can aid us to break the weapon which
                            gives to Germany her economic power, and to concert in agreement with
                            Great Britain measures of reprisals against the German trusts. At the
                            same time we most maintain our touch, by the renewal of the commercial
                            treaties, with all the small Powers of Europe in order to prevent their
                            being absorbed by Germany." (M. Caillaox in the "Matin.")</p>

                            Old Master that comes into the market. Certainly no such demands would
                            be made but for the existence of the gullible but wealthy class, who may
                            always be reckoned on to bid against a Treasury which is generally

                        <p>The death of Mr. Toole, though it came as the merciful ending of a long
                            illness borne, as all testify, with the utmost fortitude, will awaken
                            feelings of universal regret throughout, it may almost be said, the
                            entire English speaking world. Everyone knew Toole, and there was that
                            about him, apart from his gifts as an actor, which caused all to love
                            him. The pipers are filled to-day with good stories and a lectures in
                            which he figured, and one and all testify to the kindly, genial,
                            essentially human character of the man who, as comedian, will long be
                            remembered as the last of his school. On the stage, as off, it was the
                            sovereign quality of heart which preeminently distinguished Toole, and
                            it is fitting to recall in this connexion that one of the most mirth
                            provoking actors of his time was also a master of pathos who, in such
                            pieces as * Dot," moved his audiences as readily to tears as to
                            laughter. But it is even more as the man than as the comedian that Toole
                            will be remembered; and who could wish a happier epitaph! ("Westminster

                            distinguished a part, the English Brigade plucked roses from the rose

                            with spectators. By the courtesy of Major Wilding, the band of the 2nd
                            Battalion Royal Iuniskilling Fusiliers opened the entertainment, which
                            was of a most varied and enjoyable character.</p>

                        <head>OUTING AT ABOUKIR</head>
                        <p>A very pleasant outing to Aboukir was given on Monday (Bank Holiday) by
                            the A.S.C. and A.O.D. Among the various items for the afternoon's
                            amusement was a cricket match, "Ladies v. Gentlemen," which caused great
                            excitement (and amusement), the condition of play being that the
                            gentlemen batted and bowled left handed. The ladies batted first and
                            made the excellent score of 96, in which they were ably assisted by the
                            scorer and umpire. The gentlemen's innings only yielded 48, but this was
                            due to the excellent work of the lady wicket- keeper, the decisions of
                            the umpire, the absent mindedness of the scorer and the terrific bowling
                            and smart fielding of the ladies' team, one of whom brought off two
                            splendid catches in quite professional style.</p>
                        <p>The corporals of the Doblin Fusiliers were also out at Aboukir and the
                            whole made a very merry party, and the opinion was universal as the
                            train raced back to Sidi Gaber that the day had been a delightful
                            one.</p>

                        <p>On Saturday last, at Gabbari, the members met as usual in strong force
                            and competed in the following competitions:—</p>
                        <p>Diving.—1st, A. A. Eoclestone (15pts.); 2ud, C. H. Glasspole (13 pts.) ;

                        <p>Plunging.—-1st, C. H. Qlasspo'e (44 ft.); 2ud, H. R. Inglott (38 ft.);
                            3rd, A. A. Ecole- stone (37 ft.).</p>
                        <p>A polo match was then played in which Ecclestone's team somewhat easily
                            defeated Glasspole's team by 6 goals to 3. Glasspole played well and
                            scored all the goals for his aide. Mr. T. Potts refereed.</p>
                        <p>The programme for next Saturday is a 50 yards handicap for juniors and a
                            plate diving competition for the seniors, after which the customary polo
                            practice, diving, etc. There will be prizes for both the foregoing

                        <p>The members will be glad to know that two more valuable silver cups will
                            arrive shortly, one presented by the master mariners visiting the port
                            of Alexandria for the 100 yards juniors Championship and the other for
                            the seniors Diving Championship, presented by the hon. chairman of the

                    <head>THE OLDEST LIVING TREE</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes to the "Times" ;— "It is difficult to realize, in
                        these days of skepticism and higher criticism, that it is possible to see
                        and handle portions of the branches of a tree under the shade of which both
                        St Luke and St. Paul, according to Dean Farrar, probably rested. lathe
                        island of Cos, in the Aegean Sea, there stands, jealously guarded, a huge
                        plane tree, measuring nearly 18 yards in circumference. It is surrounded by
                        a podium, or raised platform, breast high, doubtless built to support the
                        trunk of the tree after it had become hollow and weak from age. The lower
                        branches are still well preserved, and have been shored up by pieces of
                        antique columns, over the upper ends of which the branches have grown like
                        caps in consequence of the pressure of their own weight. Close by the tree
                        is said to be the chair of Hippocrates, the father of medicine, and it is
                        supposed that he taught the art of healing from that seat. He was born at
                        Cos 460 B.C. This gives a cine to the age of the celebrated plane tree,
                        which must be considerably more than 2,000 years old. Dr. Edward Clapton,
                        formerly physician at St. Thomas's Hospital, whose devotion to archaeology
                        is well known, sent an agent a year or two ago to procure some fragment of
                        the tree. This was done, bat at considerable risk, as the Sultan, who1
                        attaches great importance to its preservation, has given strict orders that
                        no one is to touch the tree, which is therefore guarded day and night. The
                        specimens which Dr. Clapton obtained have now been generously banded over to
                        the Royal College of Surgeons, where they will be displayed in the museum.
                        They consist of two pieces of branch, a bundle of twigs from the branches,
                        and a small box of leaves and round buttonlike catkins of the plane
                        tree."</p>

                        kidneys and lungs. I was treated by my f homo physician and relieved to some
                        extent, but J after I had worked again for two weeks, my old
                        suffering—backache and pains in the right lung- returned. The dreadful cough
                        which bothered me day and night lasted six months and no one could help me.
                        "I tried three different patent medicines, without avail. I could scarcely
                        eat anything and slept only a few hours each night. ' 'A friend told me to
                        take Peruna. / did so and the second day my appetite had Improved. I took a

                    <head>GERMAN COMPETITION IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>FROM THE BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE JOURNAL.</p>
                    <p>In our issue for July we dealt with the various branches of imports in which
                        German competition is principally felt here, and we also endeavored to give
                        short descriptions, with actual cost prices, of some of the principal lines
                        sent over by that country. Having thus shown the existence and extent of
                        such competition, we now propose to briefly discuss the main factors which
                        have enabled Germany to obtain a footing in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that when a nation turns its attention to a new market in which
                        other countries are already more or less firmly established, and endeavors
                        to secure a share of the trade, there are only, broadly speaking, two
                        courses open to it. One method is to undersell its competitors, and the
                        other is to grant more liberal terms of payment to its customers. Given that
                        the nation is able through, let us say, cheaper labour and freights to our
                        prices, and at the same time is willing to allow easier terms of payment for
                        its goods, it will not be long before such competition will begin to make
                        itself felt—assuming, of course, that the articles sold give satisfaction.
                        If to these two guiding principles you add a careful study of the market,
                        and a readiness to alter home patterns to meet the requirements of the
                        purchasers, you obtain a combination of factors which is bound to succeed,
                        and we venture to think that such combination has, in varying degrees, been
                        used by Germany in her relations with Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Taking first of all the question of price, and leaving out all considerations
                        of labour, export rebates and quality of workmanship, there is no doubt that
                        the German has been greatly assisted by his steamship companies, and by the
                        better facilities he possesses for quoting through rates from the factory to
                        Egyptian ports. The regular lines running between London, Manchester,
                        Liverpool and Alexandria are the Moss, Prince, Papayanni, Eller-man, and
                        Westcott and Laurence, the tramp steamers being eliminated as they chiefly
                        carry coal. Now these companies are banded together into a "ring," identical
                        freights being charged by each member. On the other hand, the lines working
                        between Germany and Egypt, each as the Atlas Co. of Bremen, the Sphinx Line,
                        and the Garman Levant Line have all been in active competition with each
                        other, the result to the German manufacturer being obvious. It is true that
                        a statement recently appeared in the Press to the effect that the companies
                        trading between the Continent and the Mediterranean and Black Sea ports had
                        arrived at a "mutual understanding", but even it the shipowners succeed in
                        stopping the cutting of rates, the German has had the benefit of cheap
                        freights for some years.</p>
                    <p>It is, we believe, practically impossible for a merchant or agent, who
                        requires a rate ex English port for some special article, to obtain a
                        quotation on this side from the steamship company, it being necessary to
                        refer such enquiries to England. The representative of a German house,
                        however, can not only immediately ascertain the charge from a German port,
                        but also, merely referring to a freight book, quote a through rate from
                        almost any station in his own country to any port in the Levant. This
                        advantage is certainly one of Borne moment when a buyer requires a prompt
                        quotation.</p>
                    <p>Another point which certainly bears upon tbs question of price is the fact
                        that the German manufacturer is, in many instances, more willing to deal
                        direct with Egypt than his English confrere. The latter often argues— and
                        with some show of reason—that it is better to sell to a well known borne
                        merchant than to run the risk of making bad debts through an agent in Egypt.
                        Io such cases, "the British manufacturer's goods are handicapped by having
                        to pay an intermediate profit before being placed on the market here. The
                        German, of course, saves this profit, and, though he may make certain bad
                        debts, he trusts to recoup himself by means of a larger turnover.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the question of trade credits, although sundry commercial men
                        here are inclined to the belief that the facts of the case do not invariably
                        bear out the vaunted liberality of the German, it is generally admitted that
                        the latter has greatly assisted in bringing about the undesirable state of
                        long credits at present so prevalent in Egypt. The main aim and object of
                        the German is to get into the country, and to achieve this end he is willing
                        to be kept out of his money longer than the usual custom—provided his funds
                        will allow him to do so. We make this last reservation because we think it
                        explains to a large decree the cases where the manufacturer, after executing
                        one or two orders, make various excuses with the intention of not delivering
                        a third consignom before the bill- for the other two have matured and been
                        paid —•a natural cautiousness probably going hand in hand with a lack of
                        capital. The Garman may five credit fairly lavishly bat, speaking gene
                        rally, his limits are comparatively low.</p>
                    <p>During the past year or two, the number of German creditors figuring in the
                        failures dealt with by the Egyptian Courts has been largely un the increase,
                        and it is just possible that this fact may have been partly responsible for
                        the decreased shipments by Germany last year, Egypt is by no means a country
                        in which credit can be given in a wholesale manner, and our friends are,
                        apparently, now learning the lesson.</p>
                    <p>The third factor mentioned in oar sketch of a successfully competing nation
                        is one which<cb n="2"/>has played an important part in the development of
                        Germany's trade with Egypt. We refer, of course, to the question of
                        supplying the shapes, sizes, and patterns which the market requires, rather
                        than the goods the manufacturer primarily wishes to sell, viz: those li°
                        turns out to fixed designs. The readiness of the German, and the reluctance
                        of the British manufacturer to alter his patterns, have already been
                        commented upon in the pages of this Journal, and we do not. therefore,
                        propose saying anything further on the subject beyond just relating an
                        example which recently came under our notice.</p>
                    <p>In conversation with an English firm of commission agents who represented a
                        German lace house, wo gathered that their manufacturer had at one time
                        refused to supply black lace, but on it being pointed out to him that the
                        market required the same, he promptly altered his processes to meet the
                        demand. In order to avoid any inaccuracy in quoting the above in the pages
                        of this Journal, we asked the agents to kindly confirm the conversation, and
                        the following is an extract from their letter: —</p>
                    <p>"Finding that black lace was being sold in " large quantities, we wrote our
                        manufacturer " asking him if he could possibly manufacture " black lace as
                        well as white, to which he " replied that he could not. Sometime after, "
                        one of our customers offered us a good business to be done in this line and
                        urging him " to take it np. In a very short time we had a '* reply saying
                        tli3 offer had been accepted, " and that he had decided to commence
                        manufacturing black lace. I am quite sure that "the goods are manufactured
                        by him and are " not bought from another house." It is true that the German
                        firm happened to have a traveler in Egypt at the time, but we cannot help
                        thinking that, under similar circumstances, an English manufacturer would
                        have had something further to say on the subject before carrying out the
                        wishes of his agent in such a case.</p>
                    <p>A further point tending to assist the German in his efforts to secure trade
                        here is the consistency with which he quotes c.i.f. prices. The European, as
                        well as the Arab customer, naturally prefers to know exactly how much his
                        goods are to cost him alongside the quay, rather than to have sundry
                        uncertain charges added to his invoice alter the actual price of the article
                        has been given to him. Another feeling is that these additional expenses
                        would probably be on a lower scale if paid by the manufacturer. For example,
                        customers often have to pay Is. 6d. for stamps on three bills of lading when
                        it is only really necessary to have one of the documents so stamped, and it
                        is obvious that the British Government would not receive the extra shilling
                        if the money camo out of the shippers' pocket. The old story that the
                        expenses for cases and packing, etc.,. will be more or less nominal has not
                        the same effect now upon the Arabs as in former years, as experience has
                        taught them that the British idea of the word "nominal" is not always
                        identical with their own.</p>
                    <p>The charge of a farthing for extra finish, which was for folding the goods
                        into pieces of 11 yards each instead of the customary 12 yards, was objected
                        to by the Arab purchaser and, as a partner in the shipping house happened to
                        be here at the time, it was deducted from the account. Neither the agent,
                        nor the actual buyer, had the remotest idea what Bank commission meant, and
                        why the purchaser should be expected to pay it. We understand that the agent
                        has now protested against such a charge appearing in future invoices, and
                        that his views have been met in the matter.</p>
                    <p>The German manufacturer who wished to charge for extra finish, packing,
                        postage and bank commission would have included all these expenses in his
                        original quotation for the goods, and the invoice would simply have
                        contained one item of £11.18.8. The two methods amount to precisely the same
                        thing in the long run, bat the latter has the great advantage of satisfying,
                        instead of annoying, the customer. If owing to a lack of knowledge re
                        freights—though we should imagine this deficiency could be remedied—a home
                        manufacturer is unable to quote c i.fi, then we would suggest that all
                        charges, other than freight and insurance, be merged into the price of the
                        goods.</p>
                    <p>The parsimoniousness of British manufacturers on the subject I commercial
                        travelers is well known not only here but in most other arts of the world.
                        The Garman, while not spending money needlessly, appreciates that a mart,
                        capable, traveler is a good investment, and he acts accordingly. Again, the
                        German "in the road" in Egypt generally has an advantage in the matter of
                        languages over the average English traveler, for he will almost invariably
                        speak French, and often Italian.</p>
                    <p>Passing over the question of the increase in Egypt's population, and the
                        consequent natural growth in the demand for 'imports, the last •Mint to
                        which we wish to refer in our efforts o ascertain the reasons why Germany's
                        trade lists developed during the past ten years, is the ore keying upon the
                        rate of commission paid o the agent. With every manufacturer "a law onto
                        himself" it is obviously impossible to lay down any hard ai d fast rule, but
                        we think we are not very wide of the mark in stating that the German figure
                        is usually nearer 5% than<cb n="3"/>the rate paid by the English house. In
                        oases, too, where list prices are identical e.g. in ironmongery goods, the
                        discounts allowed by Germany to a merchant who buys for his own account are
                        out a more liberal scale than those granted by Great Britain, and it is thus
                        easy to see that even an English firm here will often endeavor to place the
                        foreign article on the market.</p>
                    <p>Having treated the while question of German trade in Egypt—so far as imports
                        are concerned—in an impartial manner, we may now ask ourselves, without fear
                        of a charge of bias being levelled at so, whether the bogie of German
                        competition, which is so often brought out by merchants and agents, has at
                        present any really strong ground for its existence. Frankly speaking, our
                        answer is in the negative, and we are inclined to the belief that the
                        so-called "evil" is rather overrated.</p>
                    <p>In 1904, for the first time in her history, Germany grossed the million line
                        in her sales to Egypt, the exact figures being L.E. 1,020,969 or nearly 5 %
                        of the latter country's total imports. Last year, however, the returns
                        dropped to LE.. 948,612 or 4.4 %. Do these facts tend to prove that our
                        rival's activity in this market acts as a very serious drag upon the growth
                        of British trade? We think not.</p>
                    <p>Again, as we showed in our statistics last month, there is hut one category
                        in which the supplies from Germany exceed L.E. 70,030 per annum—the
                        exception being iron and iron goods—and only four where the figures are
                        higher than L E. 50,000. If we eliminate Germany's iron figures from the
                        1905 returns, and make the necessary reduction in the value of Egypt's gross
                        imports, we find that the former country is only credited with L.E. 745,901
                        or 3.6 % of the total turnover.</p>
                    <p>While we do not wish to belittle the importance of Germany's position here,
                        nor to lose sight of the very probable contingency that the same will become
                        stronger as time goes on—her clearances, by the way, for the first six
                        months of the current year were over L E. 120,000 above those of the
                        corresponding period in 1905 —we venture to think that British
                        manufacturers, outside perhaps those connected with the steel and iron
                        trades, Deed not be too seriously alarmed when they hear of the competition.
                        There is no denying the fact that in many brandies of trade strenuous
                        efforts are made to obtain business, but, as it has taken Germany twelve
                        years to work on a turnover of L.E. 1,000,000 per annum—despite the growth
                        of the country's population and con8oming power--there is still hope that by
                        care and vigilance the British manufacturer may be able to keep the
                        expansion within reasonable bounds. The general adoption of c.i.f. price,
                        and consequent granting to "clean" invoices, would in our opinion go a long
                        way towards attaining this desirable end.</p>
                    <p>Although as we have teen an exaggerated view is taken of the strength of
                        Germany's competition in the import trade, there are other fields of
                        enterprise in which her efforts are making themselves felt.</p>
                    <p>A return of all shipping entered at the Port of Alexandria daring 1901 showed
                        that Germany was credited with 76,046 tons, or 3 % of the total, whilst in
                        1904 her figures had reached 119,736 tons, or 4 %. Last year the return was
                        one to 260,671 tons, or 7 %, the large increase over 1904 being in part due
                        to the new passenger service between Naples and Alexandria ran by the North
                        German Lloyd Steamship Company.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the large number of Germans annually visiting Egypt daring the
                        tourist season, it was not surprising to hear a couple of years ago that an
                        effort was to be made by Germany to capture some of the Nile traffic. In
                        1904 the Hamburg-America Line announced its intention of patting a fleet on
                        the river in opposition to Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son and the Anglo-American
                        Nile Steamship Company. The latter, thinking discretion the better part of
                        valoor, came to an arrangement with its new rival, the result being that the
                        Hamburg people agreed to withdraw their scheme and to subscribe for 6,000
                        shares of £4 each - issued at £5 — in the Anglo-American Line. The name of
                        the old company was altered to that of the Hamburg and Anglo-American Nile
                        Steamship Company.</p>
                    <p>As a farther example of German enterprise in Egypt, we may site the case of
                        the Deutsches Kohlen Depot at Port Said. Prior to the formation of this
                        concern—which took place some few years ago—the agencies at Port Said of the
                        various German lines passing through the canal were in the hands of English
                        firms, the same remarks applying to the coaliog arrangements. With the
                        advent of the new dep6t, the German owners transferred to it both their
                        orders for coal and the agencies for their lines. An attempt was then made
                        to drive the Germans out of the market by cutting prices, and at one time
                        coal WAS sold at a figure which must certainly have shown a considerable
                        loss to the shippers. The attempt however failed, in consequence of the
                        strong financial backing behind the Deutsches Kohlen Dei O'-, aQd eventually
                        a compromise was arranged, with the result that the Germans are still doing
                        business in Port Said.</p>
                    <p>Although other instances of German activity could be quoted, the last one we
                        propose mentioning is the recent opening of branches in Alexandria and Cairo
                        by the Dentsche Orient Bank. It is, of coarse, too early to speak of the
                        extent of this competition in financial circles, bat the promulgation at the
                        end of July of the Kbedi vial Decree authorizing the formation of the
                        Deutscln Baum wollpresse, or Socidtd Anonyms Egyptienne des Presses
                        Allemandes, clearly show* that the Bank is by no means dormant.</p>

                    <head>A HAREM ROMANCE</head>
                    <p>In Disenchanted M. Loti gives a deeply interesting picture of the Turkish
                        women of today. The story centres round André Lhery, "a well-known romance
                        writer," who when in Constantinople in the days of his youth had loved and
                        was loved by a beautiful Moslem maiden. She died, and he left Turkey, not to
                        return for twenty-five years. He then accepts au appointment at the Embassy,
                        and once more finds himself in the city that he had never been able to
                        banish from his memory.</p>
                    <p>One of his books had been the story of his affection for the Moslem maiden.
                        This had been read again and again by three well-born Turkish damsels, who,
                        on hearing that the author is at Constantinople, conceive the idea of
                        begging for an interview. The meeting is followed by many others,
                        notwithstanding the risk and danger that attend them, and throughout the
                        story the intimacy of the Frenchman and the three young ladies is told with
                        great charm and sympathy. One of the three girls entertains a real passion
                        for Lhery, though he is ignorant of it till after her death. Anxious that
                        their own unhappy fate and that of their fellow-sufferers should be kuown,
                        they make Lhery promise to write a book on the subject; and, to render the
                        task easy, they supply the material by relating their own histories
                        and*describing very folly the man ner of their lives in accordance with
                        Moslem roles and customs. Those of us who imagine that time stands still in
                        the harem will be surprised to learn that the</p>
                    <p>HAREM LADIES</p>
                    <p>talk German with no more difficulty than Italian or English, for these young
                        Turkish damsels read Dante, Byron, and Shakespeare in the original. Better
                        cultivated than most girls of the same class in the West, as a consequence,
                        no doubt, of their strict seclusion and long quiet evening, they devour
                        alike ancient classics and modern degenerates, and in music are equally
                        enthusiastic for Gluck, and for Cesar, Franck, or Wagner, or for reading the
                        scores of Vincent d'lndy. Perhaps, too, they profit by the long repose and
                        mental slothfulness of their mothers and grandmothers; in their brain
                        matter, newly tilled, or at least long fallow, every seed sprouts and grows,
                        as rank weeds and beautiful poisonous flowers ran wild in virgin soil...
                        With two or three exceptions, perhaps, every harem in Constantinople is of
                        the. Same type; the harem in these days is neither more nor less than the
                        female part of a family constituted as our own families are, and educated in
                        the same way, with the exception of their seclusion, of the thick veils worn
                        out-of doors, and of the improbability of ever exchanging ideas with a man,
                        unless it be the father, or the husband, or a brother, or in some cases, by
                        special grace, a very intimate cousin who was a playfellow in
                        childhood."</p>
                    <p>TURKIDH WOMEN REVOLT.</p>
                    <p>The inevitable revolt among highly educated women against an ancient system
                        which is incompatible with intellectual progress is state 1 by M. Loti with
                        great force. The writer's passion for Eastern life and scenery is apparent
                        on every page, and the book contains beautiful descriptions of
                        Constantinople and its surroundings. Take, for instance, the following</p>
                    <p>PICTURE OF STAMBOUL AT SUNSET</p>
                    <p>"Far below the waters of the Golden Horn were red and fiery as the sky itself
                        ... On the opposite shore—the shore of8tamboul— all the houses down by the
                        sea, all the lower strata of the enormous pile, were blurred and blotted
                        out, as it were, by the eternal violet haze of the evening, a mist of vapoor
                        and smoke. Stamboul changed like a mirage: no details were now
                        visible-neither the decay nor the misery, nor the hideousness of some of the
                        modern structures : it was a mere mass in outline, dark purple with edges of
                        gold, a colossal city in out jasper, bristling with spires and domes, set up
                        as a screen to shut out a conflagration in heaven."</p>
                    <p>The book, excellently translated, is one of great charm and fascination, and
                        should prove not only interesting as a story, but full of instruction to
                        Western readers as to the present position of educated women in the harems
                        of Turkey.</p>

                    <head>SUICIDE BY DYNAMITE</head>
                    <p>Graham Gibbs, a railway employ, of Wellington, Kansas, secured a packet of
                        dynamite the other day, tied it round his neck, and then lighted the fuse.
                        His death literally shook the town, and incidentally broke many windows.
                        Gibbs was blown into fragments so small that it was impossible to find any
                        remains, and burial was unnecessary. A gaping hole in the street marked the
                        place where the man stood.</p>
                    <p>A by-stander at a respectable distance says that Gibbs appeared to relent
                        while the fuse was burning, and tried to rid himself of the packet; but too
                        late. Despondency over a love affair is the explanation of this strange act.
                        In a letter to his sweetheart Gibbs said: "The entire country will ring with
                        my death."</p>
