                    <head>THE EGYPTIANS AND LORD COMER.</head>
                    <p>The date for Lord Cromer's departure from Egypt is now fixed for May 6. In
                        less than a fortnight's time the land to which he has given the best years
                        of his life will know him no more. But, though there must be an element of
                        sadness in such parting, the general tribute of admiration and respect which
                        he will carry away with him can hardly fail to fill his mind with deep
                        satisfaction. It is much, says the " Times " to have earned the, gratitude
                        of his own countrymen for the great things which he has done in their name.
                        It is much to have won the frank and generous praise of other nations, some
                        of whom have been strongly opposed in the past to certain features in the
                        policy which he pursued, but who now recognize with one accord that the
                        great English statesman and administrator has deserved well of civilization.
                        But we fancy that even more grateful to his ears than the commendations of
                        either must be the cry of regret at his departure which goes up from the
                        people he has so long helped, to rule. The European Press acknowledges the
                        greatness of the man and of his services without reserve. The native organs,
                        including some of the more moderate advocates of a Nationalist policy, pay
                        homage to his statesmanship, to his zeal for progress, and to his devotion
                        to the interests of Egypt. Down to the peasants of distant provinces and to
                        the poor in the streets of the capital, all classes of the Egyptian people,
                        without distinction of creed or of race, are expressing their grief at his
                        resignation and their thanks for his labours in the cause of their country.
                        Whilst the Khedive in the course of a farewell audience expressed to him his
                        regret, many members of the Khedivial family, of the Legislative Council,
                        and of the General Assembly, the Ministers, the chief officials, the
                        Patriarchs and Bishops of the Christian Churches, the dignitaries of the
                        Jewish and Moslem communities, the principal Judges of the Mixed and Native
                        Tribunals, Turkish and Egyptian Pashas, and Sheikhs of the Bedouin tribes
                        have gone to the British agency to do honour to the "father and regenerator
                        of Egypt," as a Coptic journal calls him. Not less significant is the grief
                        with which the news of his departure is received in the provinces. The local
                        rulers of the people openly lament the loss which is about to be fall them,
                        and it is instructive to learn that the older men, who can remember the
                        abuses of the old regime, which Lord Cromer has done so much to abolish, are
                        loudest in their regrets. No class in Egypt has derived greater or more
                        palpable benefits from his administration than he peasant cultivators of the
                        soil. They are lot ungrateful, and many letters, we are assured, have
                        reached him which bear touching witness to their feelings. No testimony to
                        his services can be more acceptable, we are conident, to a ruler such as
                        he.</p>
                    <p>That Mustapha Kamel Pasha should seize his occasion to indulge in a bitter
                        and mendacious attack upon the man whom all the world is praising, and that
                        Abdul Hamid's representative in Egypt should bear witness to the high
                        character of Lord Cromer's tradcer, is natural and intelligible. The charge
                        which the editor of "El Lewa" brings against the statesman who has created
                        modern Egypt ire a measure of his sincerity and intelligence. Whatever
                        credence such accusations may find amongst the ignorant and fanatical clique
                        to which they are addressed, they are too palpably false to command belief
                        amongst educated men of any nationality or of any political opinions. To say
                        that Lord Cromer has deprived the poor of education and that he has attacked
                        the Moslem faith may gratify Mukhtar, who, as the Sultan's representative,
                        is as authoritative a champion of freedom ant! Parliamentary institutions as
                        Mustapha Kamel. The blessing which the Turkish Pasha bestows onthe Egyptian
                        "patriot" is, however, perhaps less likely to strengthen than to weaken
                        whatever inclination sentimental politicians in European countries may have
                        felt to sympathize with Egyptian "Nationalism" as Mustapha Kamel and Mukhtar
                        understand and expound it. Lord Cromer has taken the measure of the movement
                        and has explained it to his countrymen. It is natural that the champions of
                        the agitation should resent its exposure.</p>

                        <head>Red Tape</head>
                        <p>An amusing instance of official red-tape is mentioned by Lord Cromer in
                            his Report. He remarks: I have on tormer occasions frequently alluded to
                            the tendency which exists amongst officials in Egypt to multiply
                            correspondence unnecessarily. I have now before me a typical instance of
                            the abuse to which I allude It consists of an official file of
                            thirty-one pages, all typewritten. The first paper is dated the 26th
                            February, 1905, and is the translation of an Arabic deed, from which it
                            appears that "the wise man Mohamed Osman Ali-el Zaker, from Benyan,
                            Assouan Province, bought from his nephew, Mohamed Ali-Zaker, from the
                            same village and province, half of a donkey for the sum of 195 Tuakish
                            piastres." It seems that a doubt arose as to whether the donkey had been
                            bought or stolen. On this subject, 73 official notes are recorded by
                            various officials, residing at Assouan, Dongola, Cairo, and elsewhere.
                            The last of these notes is dated the 11th November, 1906, and the
                            question of the ownership of the donkey, although it had been under
                            discussion for one year and nine months, was apparently, still
                            unsettled. I greatly hope that heads of Departments will do all in their
                            power to check proceedings of this description.</p>

                    <p>The English portion of our Cairo contemporary "L'Orient," in its issue this
                        morning, reports the meeting of the British Colony which is to be held
                        to-morrow. Such premature reporting is unexampled, we should think, even in
                        the case of American journalism. Here is the paragraph "from the paper to
                        which we refer :—</p>
                    <p>"As already announced the British Colony at Alexandria met yesterday to
                        express regrets at the departure of Lord Cromer.</p>
                    <p>"A telegram expressing this was sent to Lord Cromer, and he was asked to pass
                        through Alexandria when leaving Egypt that the British Colony 'might make a
                        demonstration in his honour."</p>

                    <head>SUDAN GAME HUNTING.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Luigi Beretta, of Milan, who .is well- known in big game hunting circles
                        in Europe has just returned from a hunt in the Sudan. In spite of the
                        excessive heat, Mr. Beretta succeeded in obtaining a plentiful bag,
                        including a fine specimen of the African bison, the horns of which measured
                        34 inches from tip to tip. Mr. Beretta was accompanied by the renowned
                        naturalist Dr. David, who rendered valuable services in the scientific
                        exploration of the trip. All the arrangements were carried out by the
                        Cairo-Office of the Hamburg American Line under the super per vision of the
                        Manager, Mr. D.E. Munari.</p>
                    <p>The full returns of animals killed during the past year are not yet complete,
                        but it is believed that the number will tie about the same as in 1905—that
                        is to say, 2,160. Game in the sanctuary has been as little disturbed as
                        possible. Very few' animals were killed in it by the officials stationed
                        within its boundaries. The officers' reserve has been less shot than in
                        1905. 105 head of game were killed in it, against 153 in the preceding year.
                        The game laws have been observed in a most satisfactory manner during the
                        year. There have been no serious cases of infringement. The confiscation of
                        the tusks of six cow elephants shot during the year, and of the tusks of an
                        undersized bull, was the only action taken under the Ordinance.</p>

                    <head>ELEVEN LIBEL ACTIONS.</head>
                    <p>Mr. C. H. Moore, of the Second Circle of Irrigation, is bringing actions for
                        libel against eight local newspapers. These journals are "The Egyptian
                        Standard," "Al Lewa, " "L'Etenard Egyptien," "Al Ahram," "Les Pyramides,"
                        "Al Minbar," "Al Moayad," and the "Journal du Caire." He is also bringing
                        actions for libel against Dervish Effendi Mustapha, a native advocate of
                        Cairo, and in all probability against Aly Bey Ghazzal, a large landed
                        proprietor of the. Menoufieh. Province, and Mahmoud Bey Abdul Ghaffir a
                        notable of Menoufieh.</p>
                    <p>The judgment pronounced by the Native Court of the Mousky in the case of
                        Serghani, head Arabic clerk to Mr. Moore, arose should be remembered, from
                        the charges brought against Mr. Moore. The sentence of a year's hard labour
                        passed by the Court on Sirghani completely exculpates Mr. Moore from the
                        vindictive accusations brought against him. The Parquet, considering that
                        Serghani's punishment is inadequate, have decided to appeal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Moore's action for libel will come before the Mixed Courts about the end
                        of next month.</p>
                    <p>He will be represented by Maltre Carton de Wiart. The Egyptian Government
                        fully concur in the proceedings which Mr. Moore is taking.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO LAND VALUES.</head>
                    <p>In our issue of the 23rd inst. regarding the sale of the Standard Life
                        Building, in Cairo, at L.E. 58 per metre, we are informed that the price
                        should be L.E 58 J per metre We also stated that this was the highest price
                        realised to date for any property in .Cairo. On further enquiry, however, we
                        find that this is not so, as several properties have changed hands at much
                        higher prices. In the Kasr-el-Nil street, some months ago, the National Bank
                        pajd LE. 60 per metre for a piece of land with a very small frontage on the
                        street ; and for a comer piece almost 'opposite, in the same street, L.E. 75
                        per metre was refused. In the same street again, on a piece of land with no
                        frontage, owned by three partners, two of the partners bought out the
                        interest of the -third at L E. 6 per metre.</p>
                    <p>In the Mousky quarter, even higher prices than these have been paid. Over a
                        year ago a fair sized property»changed hands in the Mousky at L E 65 per
                        metre, and the present proprietor is obtaining 12$% on his money at that
                        price. The Wakfs Administration refused L E. 100 per metre for land just
                        outside the Mousky, and several similar properties have changed hands at
                        prices ranging from LE 80 to L E 90 per metre.</p>
                    <p>It is true that buyers for suburban land outside Cairo are not so plentiful
                        as they were, but for anything in the way of choice sites in the main
                        streets of Cairo buyers are plentiful and the prices continue to rise, and
                        in the opinion of experts will continue do so until L E 100 per metre is
                        reached, that is to say if there are good frontages.</p>

                    <head>SUDAN TELEGRAPHS. EXTENSION SOUTHWARDS.</head>
                    <p>When the late Mr. Cecil Rhodes was in Cairo some few years ago, he spoke to
                        Lord Cromer on the subject of establishing direct telegraphic communication
                        between the north and the south of Africa. So far as the Egyptian and
                        Sudanese portion of this work is concerned, the execution of the idea is
                        within a measurable distance of completion. Telegraphic communication has
                        for some while existed between Khartoum and Tewfikieh, which is situated at
                        the junction of the Sobat and White Nile. Owing to the vast extent of marsh
                        which exists between Tewfikieh and the Bahr- el-Ghazal Province, it was
                        decided not to extend the line from the terminus at Tewfikieh to
                        Meshra-er-Rek, but to facilitate rapid communication by means of small
                        oil-launches. A weekly service was instituted between these two places early
                        in January 1906. In the winter of 1904-05, a telegraph line was constructed
                        from Meshra-er-Rek to Waw, and thence to Tonj. This line was subsequently
                        extended to Rumbek, a distance of 80 miles, where a telegraph station was
                        opened on the 15th April, 1906. A tract was then out to Mvolo (60 miles), a
                        reconnaissance of the country between Bor and Mvolo was made by Major
                        Turner, R.E, and the line to the latter place is now in course of
                        construction. On it* completion, Khartoum will be in communication with
                        Uganda by telegraph to Tewfikieh, thence by telegraph launches to
                        Meshra-er-Rek, and from the latter place by telegraph to Gonriokoro. The
                        question now presents itself of how to fill up the difficult gap south of
                        Tewfikieh. After full consideration, and an examination of the country, it
                        has been decided to carry the telegraph line 100 miles along the east bank
                        of the Bahr el Zeraf, and thence across the Iwi country to Bor. A line
                        already exist from Bahr to Gondokoro. It was opened on the 19th April, 1906.
                        Thus, before long there will be direct telegraphic communication from
                        Alexandria to the centre of Africa.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Fisher Unwin has arranged to bring out shortly a work -which has long
                        been promised, and is likely just now to attract considerable attention,
                        entitled The Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt: a Personal
                        Memoir of Events, by Mr. Wilfrid Blunt It purports to perform a. double
                        historic Junction : first, .that of giving: an: account— -more accurate than
                        has yet been attempted and derived from confidential native sources— of the
                        National Egyptian movement of the years' 188L-2 ,and secondly,-that of
                        revealing the, political and financial intrigues which in Europe led to the
                        intervention of England and the prolonged military occupation of the Nile
                        Valley. Its chief interest will lie in the candour of the recital, and the
                        revelation of the writer's own doings in Egypt and in Downing Street. It may
                        indeed be said to be Mr. Blunt's, apologia in regard both: to past events
                        and to his present attitude towards the Egyptian question.</p>

                    <head>DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOUR.</head>
                    <p>Under this heading-the English portion of "L'Orient" published yesterday a
                        disquieting paragraph for which, it appears, there was not the slightest
                        foundation, as the same paper has been 'obliged to state in to-day's paper.
                        Such statements are most regrettable. The following is the paragraph
                        referred to</p>
                    <p>We understand that as the funeral procession of Private Netherway of the
                        Coldstream Guards neared the cemetery on Sunday lost, several natives
                        created a disturbance and hurled stones at the funeral party. The civil
                        police; owing to some misunderstanding were late in arrival and so did not
                        accompany the funeral. This disgraceful scene is in itself an answer to
                        those who say, that all they advocate is peaceful opposition and that
                        fanaticism is not their object</p>

                    <head>SUDAN RUBBER.</head>
                    <p>Experiments arebeing conducted in the growing of rubber vines, Landolphia
                        Owariensis," at Wau. Rubber produced from these vines and treated with
                        citric acid has been submitted to brokers, whose opinions show that it is as
                        good as any rubber on the market It has not yet been definitely proved that
                        the Para rubber tree, which produces the best known rubber, will grow in the
                        Soudan. As is well known, this tree is being planted to a huge extent in
                        various parts of the world, and in a few years' time a very large increase
                        in the output of Para rubber is expected. The consequence of this would be
                        to flood, inferior rubber out of the market. The result of the examination
                        of the above, mentioned samples tends to show that no fears need« be
                        entertained for Soudan rubber in that event, provided the rubber is properly
                        prepared. It stiff remains to be shown, however, what productivity may be
                        expected from Landolphia vines, and how long it will take them to reach the
                        bearing stage. Recent explorations show that the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province
                        contains more rubber vines than was at one time believed.</p>

                    <p>The Company has been formed for the objects mentioned in its Memorandum of
                        Association and more especially for the purchase and development and
                        extension of the Abbassia Sand Bricks Company G m.b H.</p>
                    <p>The Abbassia Sand Brick Company G. m; b. H. (hereinafter called the Old
                        Company) was started about two years ago to meet the increasing demand in
                        Cairo and its suburbs for bricks and building materials. A factory was set
                        up by the Old Company and the main work of this factory was the manufacture
                        of sand-bricks.</p>
                    <p>These bricks are made of a mixture of sand and lime (both of which materials
                        are found in abundance in close proximity to the factory) and possess many
                        excellent building qualities. They are more durable and offer a greater
                        power of resistance than the ordinary clay brick and at the same time they
                        can be turned out ready for immediate use in a far shorter space of
                        time.</p>
                    <p>These advantages are naturally appreciated by building and construction firms
                        and companies and large contracts have already been fulfilled for some of
                        the most important of these in Cairo and its suburbs</p>
                    <p>The Semiramis Hotel is built of sand bricks furnished by the Old Company, and
                        a contract has already been entered into for supplying sand-bricks for the
                        new Ritz Hotel that is shortly to be erected at Garden City, Kasr-el-Aine,
                        Cairo. Orders have also been received from the Heliopolis Oasis Company,
                        from the contractor for the new barracks at Abbassia and other important
                        building and contracting firms.</p>
                    <p>In short so many orders have been taken and so many demands have been-made on
                        the Old Company that it has been found impossible to fulfil them all with
                        the present factory.</p>
                    <p>It has been decided therefore to form toe Cairo Sand Bricks Company Limited
                        (hereinafter called the New Company) to take overall assets and liabilities
                        of the Old Company as from the 31st day of December 1906 and with the
                        increased capital that will be provided to considerably enlarge the factory
                        already in existence</p>
                    <p>In this way it is hoped that the output will be more than doubled and that
                        substantial profits will consequently accrue to the New Company.</p>
                    <p>The purchase price to be paid for the business and goodwill of the Old
                        Company has been fixed at Lst, 45.000. This sum will be satisfied by the
                        allotment of fully paid Ordinary and Founders Shares of the New Company as
                        is shown by Agreement No. 1 set out hereunder. For this price the new
                        Company will acquire some &amp;5O0 square metres of land at Abbassia and the
                        plant, machinery, fixtures, etc. of the old Company. Further it will take
                        over the benefit of all contracts entered into by the Old Company in the
                        ordinary course of its business as well as all its liabilities subsequent to
                        the 31st December 1906.</p>
                    <p>The situation of the site of the factory is in the Directors' opinion in
                        every way an excellent one. The necessary material for the manufacture of
                        the bricks is close at hand and in the matter of transport the factory
                        possesses exceptional facilities having at its doors a secondary line of the
                        State Railways and a Branch line of the Delta Light Railways Company.
                        Further lying as it does between Cairo and the Heliopolis Oasis delivery by
                        road to either of these important building centres can be easily
                        effected.</p>
                    <p>The Vendors to and the promoters of the New Company are the Old Company and
                        the following contract has been entered into by them with the New
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>N° 1. AGREEMENT dated the 10th day of April 1907 and made between the Old
                        Company whose registered office is situated at Alexandria of the one part

                            <p>A sensation was caused in the Duma yesterday by the reading of the
                                report of a commission, the truth of which is admitted by Government
                                officials, showing that political prisoners in Riga have been
                                subjected to horrible tortures prior to their execution, in order to
                                endeavour to extort confessions : their toenails were extracted,
                                they were beaten with india-rubber flails, and their bones were
                                broken by compression. The Government has announced that it has
                                ordered an enquiry and the prosecution of the guilty. (Router)</p>

                            <p>House of Commons. Mr. Haldane's territorial army bill has been read
                                for the second time and passed by 343 votes to 31.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Haldane mentioned that the Colonial Premiers unanimously agreed
                                that his proposed territorial force was the best pattern which they
                                could keep in view in organising their home forces ; there would
                                thus be a chain of territorial forces in the Empire which might
                                afford a real sense of security. The Government regarded the bill as
                                a bulwark against conscription. (Reuter)</p>

                    <dateline>London, April 19.</dateline>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the new London County Council loan and one or
                        two other issues of lesser importance have, been placed this week, there
                        still continues to be a plethora of -money in Lombard Street, and there are
                        no signs that the present condition of ease is likely to reach a limit for
                        some considerable time to come.</p>
                    <p>There has been a great rush for the County Council loan; and it is stated
                        that the portion offered to the public, amounting to £2,500,000, was covered
                        between twenty and thirty times. It is understood that applicants for large
                        amounts will have to be content with about 8 per cent, of the amount asked
                        for. The new issue is quoted on the Stock Exchange at about 1/2 premium.</p>
                    <p>The Budget proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer are looked upon very
                        favourably from the money market point of view. Mr. Asquith in his speech
                        very properly pointed out that there had been enormous additions to capital
                        liabilities of the state and municipalities ; the admission of Colonial
                        stocks into the category of trustee investments ; abnormal activity in
                        trade, leading to higher prices and higher wages, as well as other causes
                        which had contributed to the fall in gilt-edged securities. He also gave a
                        not unnecessary reminder that per cent, stock at S3, a point it had not yet
                        reached—was equal to 3 percent, stock at par. Even with the fluctuations
                        which have taken place, our credit still stands higher than that of any
                        other country.</p>
                    <p>The Bank return this week shows a further addition to the reserve of
                        £659,000, and the proportion to liabilities has improved 1$ to -14 J per
                        cent. There is an increase of £438,000 in the stock of bullion, while the
                        note circulation shows a contraction of £221,000. The market has reduced its
                        indebtedness to the Bank by £639,000.</p>
                    <p>Silver.</p>
                    <p>Although the price of silver is not very firm at present, it is believed that
                        a further rise will shortly take place. Yesterday the question improved to
                        30. 15/16d. per ounce.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>Paucity of business continues to be the general complaint of members of the
                        Stock Exchange, and this highly respectable fraternity are more and more
                        convinced that they are hardly used by the investing public. They recollect
                        with sorrow of heart the days when membership of the "House" was a thing to
                        live for, and it is little comfort to them to be told that they largely owe
                        their present unhappy condition to the marvellous prosperity of the trade of
                        the country. Yet, as we have before pointed out this is an undeniable fact.
                        The investing public have been so badly bitten by the decreasing values of
                        stocks and shares, that nowadays if they are able to pat out their money to
                        fair interest in a good industrial concern, they are content to leave the
                        Stock Exchange severely alone.</p>
                    <p>This week markets have been very inactive, and for the most part the tone has
                        been weak. The Budget announcement, while it has created &amp; favourable
                        impression, has entirely failed to stimulate business, and stagnation
                        prevails almost throughout.</p>
                    <p>Console.</p>
                    <p>The gilt-edged section continues to display a weak tone, and Consols have
                        shown a drooping tendency. To-day they opened a trifle higher, but have
                        since fallen away, and close 1/4 lower for cash and account at 85 13/16and
                        85 15/16| respectively.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>After being firm and well supported, the market for international bonds was
                        inclined to be dull yesterday. Russian securities, which had been previously
                        favoured, shed 1/4, the Fours closing tit 75 and the last issue at 85 1/4,
                        at which prices they showed advances on our last quotations of 1/2 and 3/4
                        respectively.</p>
                    <p>Japanese have been quiet and steady. There was some demand for the
                        Four-and-a-half per cents., and the price was put up 1/4 to 95. Yesterday,
                        however, the stock lost the advance, closing at 94 3/4.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Government bonds have been neglected to-day, but quotations are
                        generally maintained. Russians and Japanese are unaltered.</p>
                    <p>Home Ralls,</p>
                    <p>On Monday home rails were a very good market, and in most cases substantial
                        advances on last week's prices were marked at the close. The public interest
                        has not however, been maintained, and during the rest of the week the tone
                        has been dull, with the exception of two or three stocks, notably Central
                        London and the Scottish Preference. Central London were very active at the
                        beginning, and both Ordinary and Deferred improved 3 and 2 respectively.
                        These shares have continued firm throughout, the Ordinary gaining a further
                        point to 77.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday most of the shares closed flat North Western, North Eastern, and
                        Great Northern deferred dropped 3/4, and South Western Deferred, Midland
                        Deferred, Great Western, and Great Eastern1/2.</p>
                    <p>Caledonian Preference were a firm point, and finished 3/4 higher and the
                        ordinary were also ½ higher. North British Preference gained 1/4.</p>
                    <p>The shares of the heavy Hues have given way again to-day. Caledonian Deferred
                        have lost 3/4, to 28 1/2, but the Preference are up 1/2 to 69. North British
                        Orel are also f lower.</p>
                    <p>Americans.</p>
                    <p>There has not been very much business done in Americans, which have displayed
                        an irregular tendency. The market both here and in New York appears to be
                        suffering from the reaction following the panic of a month ago, which
                        frightened many investors. Yesterday in Wall Street was one of the dullest
                        days on record, the aggregate sales only amounting to about 300,000 shares,
                        largely confined to about four stocks.</p>
                    <p>The changes on balance are insignificant, prices being in the main from one
                        to two dollars lower than last Saturday's close.</p>
                    <p>The market has been idle to-day. Unions have advanced 1 to 141, and there are
                        other gains of 1/4-3/4. Illinois Central have shed 2 to 148.</p>
                    <p>Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>For the reasons mentioned in our article last week the market has taken the
                        resignation of Lord Cromer very calmly, and this is a good sign of the
                        confidence which dealers in this section feel that the choice of Sir Eldon
                        Gorst for the position of Consul-General is a guarantee that the high
                        traditions and the wise policy formulated and so ably carried out by Lord
                        Cromer will be continued. It is fully recognised that the valuable
                        experience of Egyptian affairs obtained by Sir Eldon Gorst during his long
                        residence at Cairo, combined with his previous training and his natural
                        abilities, has admirably fitted him to guide the future destinies of
                        Egypt</p>
                    <p>At the beginning, as was natural, the market was slightly easier, but has
                        since finned up, though there is not much business doing. National Bank of
                        Egypt at on time fell to 24} ex dividend, but are now up to 24|-|.
                        Agricultural Bank have changed hands at 8\ closing 8 5/8-7/8. The Preference
                        are 9 3/8-5/8, and the 3 % Debentures are very nominal at 86-8.
                        Anglo-Egyptian Bank are a wonderfully firm market at 14 1/8-3/8.</p>
                    <p>Daira Sanieh were at one time as low as 15 1/4, but yesterday they jumped up
                        to 15 3/4, and closed rather sellers at this price. To-day they leave off at
                        15 3/8- 5/8. The Egyptian Delta Light Railway Preference have been depressed
                        on forced sales, and have been down to 10 5/8, but close to 10 5/8-7/8.
                        Delta Land and Investment have been flat without any recovery, the price
                        falling from 3 1/2 to 2 15/16. They are now 2 7/8- 3 1/8. Union Fonciere are
                        quoted 5 1/4-3/4, and Land Bank of Egypt 8 ¼ -3/4|.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday Egyptian Estates were offered down to 1 3/4, and the Deferred were
                        15-18. This morning the ordinary were better at 1 3/4-7/5, and leave off
                        to-night at this price. Corporation of<cb/></p>
                    <p>Western Egypt are unchanged at 5/8 – 7/8, as are also Egyptian Markets at 1
                        1/4, and Salt &amp; Soda at l /32. Daira Deferred are on offer at 88 without
                        response.</p>
                    <p>This morning Egyptian Options broke very badly, the shares falling to a
                        nominal price of 10/-s. without any purchasers being found. They close at
                        3/8-5/8.</p>
                    <p>Mining.</p>
                    <p>There appears to be absolutely no interest taken in mining shares, and the
                        market continues to droop for lack of support. There is little probability
                        that this section will receive much attention until the political situation
                        in South Africa is more settled, and the native labour question is disposed
                        of once for all. Investors have dropped so much over mining shares in
                        general, that they are very chary of having anything further to do with them
                        while affairs are in such a state of uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>This week little business has been done, and the alterations in quotations
                        are slight. Rand Mines leave off tonight at 6 J as compared with 6,27/32
                        last Saturday, and East Rands at 4 A as against 4,17/32.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian mining shares are quite lifeless, and no changes have taken place in
                        quotations since last we wrote.</p>
