                    <head>EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND.</head>
                    <p>Many residents in Egypt will learn, remarks the Morning Post, with sincere
                        regret that .what has been described as "the eternal question of finance" is
                        troubling the admirable body which administers the Egypt Exploration Fund.
                        At the eighteenth ordinary general meeting of the fund, which was held
                        yesterday week, the treasurer made a statement which he regretfully
                        described as "the most unfavour able he had had to deal with." This
                        description would appear to be fully justified by the figures laid before
                        the subscribers. The income of the Exploration Fand for the year amounted to
                        £1,806, of the Archaeological Survey to £422, and of the Graeco-Roman branch
                        to £931-a total of £3,159. The expenditure on the different accounts was
                        respectively £3,084, £553, and £1,325, a total of £4,962, which shows a
                        deficit for the year of £1,803. In part this serious deficit is to be
                        attributed to a falling off in the subscriptions received from America.
                        There is a sense in which this falling off can scarcely be regretted, for it
                        appears to be due to the fact that our American cousins are now undertaking
                        independent investigations on their own account) No work is less national
                        and less sectarian in character than the attempt to reconstruct the history
                        of early civilisations by unearthing the relics of the forgotten past,
                        buried beneath the accumulations of succeeding generations. That is a field
                        in which the scholars and historians of every country can meet with no more
                        feeling of friendly rivalry than serves to act as a stimulus to fresh
                        efforts. The field is wide enough for all, and the labourers are not so
                        numerous that we cannot welcome newcomers, even when their independent
                        action robs our own organisation of a certain amount of support. The United
                        States are the home of magnificent enterprises, and it can scarcely be
                        doubted that a distinctively American organisa<cb n="6"/>tion will receive
                        more generous support than one which has its headquarters on this side of
                        the Atlantic. The other contributory cause e assigned by the treasurer for
                        the deficit on the 3 year's finances may paradoxically be described . as the
                        increased success of the operations which it is the object of the fund to
                        promote. It has been found necessary to send out more expeditions than was
                        originally contemplated, and these additional, expeditions have naturally
                        involved increased expenditure. In these circumstances the appeal of the
                        treasurer and of Sir John Evans, the president or the fund, for a somewhat
                        more generous measure of support ought not to be allowed to go without a
                        response. Five thousand pounds is not an excessive sum for a rich country to
                        devote annually to unravelling the secrets of a land so rich in historical
                        interest as Egypt, and now that our position on the banks of the Nile is
                        more firmly established the Egypt Exploration Fund may be said to have a
                        fresh claim on the generosity of the British public. Modern Egypt is a
                        monument to our capacity as a ruling race, but in the excavation and
                        preservation of the monuments of the past we have an opportunity of linking
                        the past with the present which we ought not to neglect. In his presidential
                        address Sir John Evans gave an interesting account of some of the more
                        recent finds, from the golden statuette of a local divinity, discovered on
                        the site of the ancient Herakleopolis, sixty miles south of Cairo, bearing
                        on its base a dedication by a King of the XXIV. Dynasty, of whom no other
                        relics are known, to a series of documents throwing unexpected light on the
                        everyday existence of the men and women who lived on the banks of the Nile
                        at the beginning of the Christian era. As we read the terms of the bond of
                        apprenticeship that bound Thorus to learn the art of weav ing from Heraclas,
                        we realise that the Great Britain of the Twentieth Century is less widely
                        separated from the Egypt of the First Century than, in our ignorance, we had
                        supposed. It is, indeed, startling to find that eighteen hundred years ago
                        Egyptian youths were apprenticed to learn the art and mystery of shorthand.
                        Already the operations of the fund have seriously modified our ideas of the
                        ancient world, and there can be no doubt that fresh discoveries of immense
                        interest and importance await the skilful labourer in this fascinating
                        field. What magnificent opportunities there are buried beneath the sands of
                        Egypt for a millionaire with imagination! But the combination is so little
                        to be counted on that it is, perhaps, safer to echo the appeal of the
                        treasurer that everyone interested in the work of unveiling the past will
                        contribute, according to his ability, to rescue the Egypt Exploration Fund
                        from the financial difficulties that have overtaken it.</p>

                        proud of both ships. and men, the latter of whom have made them- selves

                    <p>After the announcement that Signa. Irma Monti-Baldini was to appear as Carmen
                        at the Abbas Helmy Theatre on Thursday night, we had expected to see a very
                        full house. Such, however, was not the case, but this is probably to be
                        ascribed to the large numbers of people who went on board the Greek flagship
                        Psara. There was nevertheless a fairly large audience, who enthusiastically
                        applauded the charming artiste, than whom Italy possesses no better
                        interpreter of the role. Her acting and singing throughout the opera was
                        absolutely, beyond reproach. Her voice is of beautiful quality and rang out
                        splendidly in the few numbers of the opers which I gave her scope, while in
                        her acting she realised the character of the fickle, impulsive gipsy to
                        perfection. She was several times encored and had to come before the curtain
                        repeatedly in response to the plaudits of the audience. The Escamillo of
                        Sig. Ernesto Badini was also a fine piece of work, his inter- pretation
                        being full of distinction and power. Sig. Badini is both a good singer and a
                        good actor. He has scored several successes during the present season, and
                        his Escamillo is certainly not the least of his achievements. The Dancairo
                        of Sig. Bordogni was very satis factory, as was also Sig. Montanari in his
                        double role of Il Remendado and Morales, but Sig. Pagani's interpretation of
                        the part of the soldier hero fell wide of the mark. He was apparently not at
                        home in the role and his performance was weak. Signa. Nesleida made a
                        charming Micaela, doing the little she had to do well, while Signorine
                        Venturini and Maz zuchelli were good as Frasquita and Mercedes,
                        respectively. Sig. Silvio Queirolo made an efficient Capitano</p>

                        during the passage of the Baltic squadron in the Canal. Similar
                        instructions, we learn to- day, have been given by all consuls at that port
                        for compliance by foreign steamers. This measure of precaution was agreed
                        upon by the consuls at a meeting held at the Suez Gou-</p>
                    <p>vernorat.</p>
                    <p>Arrangements have been made for mounted police to guard the whole length of
                        the Canal while the Baltic squadron is passing. Police steam-launches will
                        also escort the cruisers and transports in the Canal. The torpedo-boats. and
                        destroyers, as an exceptional case, will be i allowed to go at full speed,
                        as the Canal will be clear of traffic..</p>
                    <p>Our Port Said Correspondent telegraphs to- day at noon to the effect that the
                        ships of the Baltic squadron are expected momentarily.</p>
                    <p>Every sort of precaution has been taken to avoid any disagreeable incident in
                        the Suez Canal. During the passage of the ships they will be preceded,
                        followed, and generally escorted by Coast Guard vessels, while both banks of
                        the Canal will be thoroughly patrolled by a strong detachment of police,
                        Coast Guards, and the Camel Corps.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the question of coaling, our Correspondent understands that the
                        ships will be allowed to take on a sufficient quantity to take them to
                        Djibouti or Aden if, on examina- tion, their bunkers prove to be depleted.
                        The amount of coal given will depend entirely on the quantity the ships are
                        carrying when they put in at Port Said.</p>

                    <head>NILE NAVIGATION.<lb/>BOULAC BUSY.</head>
                    <p>Six steamers for the Nile are now being built at Messrs. Thos. Cook and Sons'
                        engineering works at Boulac. The first, which was launched some time ago, is
                        a steam dahabieh built to the order of Mr. Mond. It is a fine vessel fitted
                        with the very latest improvements according to the special designs made by
                        Mr. Mond. On her preliminary trials the boat proved most satisfactory,
                        steaming very easily at her normal speed. One of the most pleasing features
                        of the trials was the entire absence of vibration.</p>
                    <p>Two keels of 90-foot boats for river pas senger service have been laid down
                        to the order of the Cairo Omnibus Company, and two 100- ton steam barges
                        have been recently, supplied to the International Company and have proved an
                        unqualified success. Both are fitted with masts and sails which can be
                        lowered to enable the boats to pass under bridges.</p>
                    <p>A large barge, which has been ordered by the Kom Ombo Company, is now all but
                        com- pleted and will be ready for preliminary trials in the course of the
                        week.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. T. Cook &amp; Sons have lately installed in their workshops a new
                        gas-producing engine made by Messrs. Tangye, the well-known Bir- mingham
                        firm, and are also laying down heavy machinery to cope with the increased
                        work now necessary, "viz., 1 power hammer, 1 pair heavy rolls, heavy lathes,
                        etc., etc. The gas- producing engine takes very little room and is very easy
                        to work. Hard anthracite coal is fed into a generator and after passing
                        through a scrubber becomes suction gas which is ready for working the
                        engine. The machine, which develops 38 brake horse power, is now replac- ing
                        two steam and oil engines. The cost of running such an engine works out at
                        under P.T. per 5 brake horse power per hour. Messrs. T. Cook &amp; Sons have
                        already received several orders for machines of this class.</p>

                        STATEMENT.</head>
                    <p>The congested condition of the port of Alex- andria and the lack on the State
                        Railway of enough rolling stock to meet the increasing wants of the
                        commercial community have lately formed the subject of petitions to the
                        Govern- ment and of hostile criticism in the Press. It is P reluctantly
                        admitted that the extraordinarily rapid development of Alexandrian trade has
                        outstripped the efforts of the authorities to keep pace with it, but we are
                        authorised to state that the Government realises the gravity of the
                        situation, and a provision has been) made in the Budget of 1905 of a sum of
                        L.E. 178,000 for the improvement of the port and customs accommodation. This
                        sum is distributed as follows:- Customs buildings</p>

                    <p>1,000</p>
                    <p>During the last four years, sums amounting to L.E. 197,000 have been spent on
                        the Port of Alexandria. These sums were allotted at a time when all the
                        departments of the Administra tion, with the exception of the Irrigation
                        Department, had to be content with meagre subsidies, so that it cannot be
                        said that the Government has been unmindful of the needs of Egypt's greatest
                        port.</p>
                    <p>As to the railway, last spring, the consent of the Caisse de la Dette was
                        obtained to an extraordinary expenditure of £200,000, pro- vided in equal
                        shares by the Government and the Caisse, for the purchase of rolling stock,
                        etc. This new stock will be arriving shortly, and it is hoped that about 400
                        new trucks will be brought into use before the year ends.</p>
                    <p>Under the financial conditions of the past, further expenditure would have
                        been difficult or impossible, but the Anglo-French Convention having been
                        ratified by the French Chamber, the Railway Administration has been author-
                        ised to proceed without delay to make such further purchases as the
                        requirements of trade may necessitate.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations have commenced for the delivery of at least 1000 new trucks in
                        the course of next year.</p>

                        <p>The absorbing topic here during the week has been the possible arrival of
                            the Baltic Fleet. The ships have been expected since Sunday last, but as
                            yet there is no definite news of their having left Suda Bay, and there
                            are sceptical ones who wonder if they will ever pass through the
                            Canal.</p>

                        <p>The French yacht Fiorentina II. was moored parallel with the Furious, and
                            the Aspern, in taking up her berth between the two, managed to get stern
                            on to the yacht and stern on to the Furious. She had the choice of
                            ramming the yacht or bumping the Furious with her stern. The latter
                            course was taken, and a dent was put in the after port side of the
                            Furious. Full apologies and offers of compensation were at once
                            made.</p>

                            worked by an ingenious system of signals from the bridge. Two small

                    <p>La tragédie de Corneille a reçu hier l'accueil qu'elle méritait. Interprétée
                        à ravir comme elle l'a été par la troupe Silvain, cette poésie måle et fière
                        dont le secret semble avoir dis- paru avec les grands auteurs classiques,
                        est toujours aussi vivante, aussi jeune qu'aux premiers jours. Elle réveille
                        en nous les plus nobles sentiments, elle nous transporte d'ad- miration.
                        C'est ainsi qu'Horace, tragédie de Pierre Corneille, et Tartufe, comédie de
                        Mo- lière, auront été les deux meilleures pièces données au Zizinia, la

                    <p>Venons en maintenant à l'interprétation. Elle a été excellente. C'est d'abord
                        le vieil Horace (Silvain), le patriote ardent, au visage fier, à la parole
                        vibrante, à l'attitude majes tueuse, tel en mot qu's dû le rêver le grand
                        Corneille lui-même; c'est Camille (Mme Sil- vain), superbe de fureur contre
                        son frère et e contre Rome, lorsqu'elle apprend la mort de e son fiancé;
                        c'est Sabine (Mlle Marbeau) la fiancée d'Horace vainqueur et la soeur des
                        trois Curiaces tués par lui dans le combat; c'est Curiace (Jean Renaud)
                        stoïque en face du devoir et dont le cœur cependant se révolte contre le
                        sort ; c'est Horace enfin (La Morgan) le patriote emporté et orgueilleux qui
                        ne con- Y nait que la patrie et va pour elle jusqu'à tuer</p>

                    <head>ZUBAIR PASHA.<lb/>HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</head>
                    <p>(Continued.)</p>
                    <p>After a few months' rest and preparation at Khartoum, Zubair started again
                        for the Nyan- nyam country (1864), with a new idea in his mind. It was the
                        custom in that land that malefactors should be sold in the market to be
                        killed and eaten. Zubair made large purchases, but only of such criminals as
                        were fit to bear arms, whom he proceeded to train in their use. Zubair's
                        father-in-law the king, not unnatur ally, took alarm at this proceeding,
                        and, when Zubair obtained leave to go ivory-hunting in the neighbouring but
                        hostile King Duyah's country, sent an army to waylay his son-in-law: which
                        army Zubair met and atterly routed, thereby ensuring himself a favourable
                        recep- tion from King Duyah.</p>
                    <p>Peace was presently patched up between Z- bair and his father-in-law, but on
                        condition that he should seek some other country; and he goes to Kolou,
                        where he has the death of a brother to avenge. With his army of rescued
                        malefactors he makes war on the king of this land, kills him, takes his son
                        and successor prisoner, and instals himself in their place. He re-names the
                        capital after himself Dem Zubair, lays claim to the surrounding regions as
                        far as the Bahr al-Arab, proclaims his readiness to receive recruits into
                        his army, and organises a State in accordance with the principles of Islam.
                        Eight years have transformed him from a com- mercial traveller into a
                        despot.</p>
                    <p>His first task was to open up a trade route between Bahr el-Ghazal and
                        Kordofan, which he effected by treaty with the sheikhs of the Arab tribes,
                        called Rizegat. They swear fifty oaths on the Koran that in return for a
                        fixed percentage they will allow traders to transport their goods through
                        the country unmolested.</p>
                    <p>In 1869 occurred the brush between Zubair and the Khedivial troops, which has
                        been frequently narrated, (1) and on which Zubair adds no fresh information.
                        His victory, he tells us, led to his name becoming renowned far and wide,
                        and to applications from various tribes begging to be allowed to put
                        themselves under his protection. The growth of his power alarmed his father
                        in-law, the Nyam-nyam king, who first cut off his princely allowance to his
                        daughter, and in the year 1872 invaded the new kingdom. So Zubair states;
                        whatever may have been the rights of the affair, a year of warfare ended
                        with the death of the Nyam-nyam king, and the incor poration of his
                        dominions in those of his son- in-law.</p>
                    <p>In this country, known as Dar-Fertit, there were at the time eight "kings" in
                        constant warfare with each other, whose subjects hunted each other. When
                        Zubair became master,, he showed them the error of their ways, and
                        established peaceful commerce.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Arabs, known as Rizegat, who occupied the route vid Shaka from
                        Bahr el-Ghazal to Kordofan, had broken their treaty and resumed their
                        attacks on the traders. These tribes were nominally under the autho tity of
                        the autonomous Sultan of Darfur; when the latter paid no attention to a
                        demand that they should be kept in order, Zubair proceeded to deal with them
                        himself. In a series of battles, fought in July and August 1873, he defeated
                        them, and thus became master of their capital Shaka (in Gordon's time "a
                        nest of slave-dealers") and the sur- rounding country. In one of these
                        battles he took prisoner Abdallah al-Ta'a'ishi, who after- wards won fame as
                        "the Khaleefah"; he was at that time employed as sorcerer by his tribe, and
                        his life was spared owing to the representa- tions of the legal experts who
                        accompanied Zubair on his expeditions, with stricts orders to restrain him
                        if he was ever about to violate the precepts of the Koran.</p>
                    <p>About the time when relations were becoming strained between Zubair and the
                        Sultan of Darfur, the former thought fit to affect the position of agent for
                        the Khedive, and wrote to Cairo, laying his conquests at his master's feet,
                        and requesting that some one be appoint. ed to administer the newly
                        conquered territo- ries. This act he declares to have been dictat ed solely
                        by loyalty; and it is the more sur prising since in his correspondence with
                        the Sultan of Darfur, he declares himself certain of victory on the ground
                        of his Abbasid descent: for the Prophet Mohammed had prayed that the
                        offspring of his uncle Abbas might always be victorious. Whatever motive
                        this descendant of the Caliphs may have had for seeking to be a vassal of a
                        vassal of the Sultan, he obtained his request. On November 22, 1873, a
                        missive arrived from Cairo, bestowing on him the title Bey, and investing
                        him with the government of the new provinces, on condition of his furnishing
                        a tribute of £15,000 annually, that matter being the chief concern of the
                        home government.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIACA.</head>
                    <byline>BY JOSEPH OFFORD.</byline>
                    <p>In the London anthropological journal Man some months ago Mr. H. R. Hall
                        discussed the question of the early use of iron' in Egypt, the discovery of
                        a piece of worked iron in sixth- dynasty deposits by Professor Petrie having
                        carried its antiquity back very far, some 2,000 years sooner than, as far as
                        we know at pre- sent, it was used in Europe. It may be noted that in 1837
                        some wrought iron was discovered in the great pyramid, and 20 years ago M.
                        Gaston Maspero found iron in a fifth-dynasty pyramid. Professor Montelin's
                        view, that iron was unknown in Egypt until about 1500 B.C., is now shown to
                        be untenable. Probably the whole subject will be exhaustively treated in M.
                        Chantre's great work, "Recherches Anthro- pologiques en Egypte," which has
                        been published a few weeks since.</p>
                    <p>If iron was known in Egypt 2,000 years be- fore any specimen of its remains
                        found in Europe can reasonably be dated, it is very curious now that we know
                        that in very early times intercourse between Egypt and Crete was frequent.
                        It is not because all remnants of iron have perished in the moist soil of
                        Europe, because we are aware from Homer that at the time of the Trojan war
                        so new and scarce was iron, that a piece of the metal formed a prize at the
                        games held at the funeral of Patroclus.</p>
                    <p>In view of the fact that the, completion of the great Barrage at Assouan has
                        submerged beneath the Nile the temple of Augustus at Philae, Herr Borchardt
                        gives in the "Jahrbuch Arch." for 1903 a description of the ruin as
                        excavated in 1895-6.</p>
                    <p>It was a tetrastyle prostyle with a cella, probably lighted from the roof. A
                        broad range of steps connected the temple with the entrance court, which was
                        entered from the city gate, and contained a base of an altar or statue. An
                        inscription gives the date of the dedication of the temple as 11, B. C. It
                        must have been. commenced some time after 26 B. C., because the somewhat
                        egotistical inscription of C. Gallus, of that date, had the stone upon which
                        the text was cut utilised for the foundations. The materials used are
                        chiefly from Nubian quarries, and the architectural forms were simple, based
                        upon Egyptian styles. The efforts made at a later date to repair damage
                        caused by an earthquake are interesting to architects. The article contains
                        26 illustrations and is the final work upon the subject, the edifice now
                        being submerged.</p>
                    <p>A few months ago the Egyptian Gazette published a summary of M. Raymond
                        Weil's researches as to representation and inscriptions relating to the very
                        earliest dynasty Pharaohs in the Sinai Peninsula. He has now published a
                        further specimen of these archaic reliefs from the Wady Magherah close to
                        the other inscriptions of Mersekha and of Zoser of per- haps the first
                        dynasty.</p>
                    <p>Like the other Sinai reliefs it delineates in one tableau the monarch
                        striking a kneeling Asiatic with a mace, and duplicate carved re-
                        presentations of the Pharaoh walking, one bearing the white, and the other
                        the red crown of Egypt. The hawk name "Neb-maat" is given. If this reliet is
                        of any chronological value it is as perhaps indicative from its
                        juxtaposition and similarity of style to its duplicates of Mersekha and
                        Zoser that these two kings were not far separate in date from Seneferu.
                        There is moreover reason now to think that Egyptian wars in the Sinaitic
                        peninsula were waged before the historic dynasties, not only by the
                        followers of Horus, but by that demi- god himself. For the great inscription
                        at the temple of Ombos relating to Aroeris, or Horus, says, "He it was who
                        struck down the bar- barians of Sinai in his form of Sopt." That is the
                        Horus of the Arabic Nome, the nearest Egyptian province to Sinai.</p>
                    <p>An Italian scholar, Signor G. Vitelli, is devoting himself to publishing the
                        more com- plete of the many Greek papyri now preserved in Italian Museums.
                        His essays upon them appear, from time to time, in the archaeolo- gical
                        journal Atene e Roma. In 1903 he edited therein, with commentary, a papyrus
                        from Ashmunen, the ancient Hermopolis, con- taining a contract relative to a
                        loan of 500 drachmas for 5 months, at an annual interest of 12 per cent. The
                        security offered is the renewal of a mortgage which had been received as
                        security for the previous loans. The document is dated early in A.D. 109.
                        This year Mr. Vitelli publishes a curious fragment of a treatise entitled
                        περὶ παλόν: it gives the mystic signification of involuntary movements of
                        the body and states the god to be propitiated in each case. Whether the
                        deities in question really relieved the ancient sufferers from diseases
                        allied to "St. Vitus's Dance" is a matter for medical men to consi- der. The
                        somewhat obliterated text of, four columns of writing, unfortunately, only
                        are, <cb n="3"/> necessarily in many cases the same as those published last
                        winter by M. Teymour de Ricci in his Corpus of recently discovered Greek
                        texts from Egypt relating to Roman times. M. Reinach gives in full the long
                        text from Memphis, which Professor Maspero edited in the "Annals" of the
                        Cairo Museum, vol. II. 285. Professor Sayce has this year printed in the
                        "Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeo- logy" five Greek
                        inscriptions that were brought from Egypt several years ago by Mr. G. W.
                        Fraser. They are of interest because one from near Minieh proved that a
                        Greek garrison was stationed there early in Ptolemaic times. It is a
                        dedication "to King Ptolemy and Arsinoe Philadelphus by the commandant and
                        the troops under him." It must date between 277 and 270 B. C., that is,
                        between the marriage of Arsince and her decease. Another of the inscriptions
                        is from Sebennytus and shows there was a temple of Herakles there in the
                        Greek period.</p>
                    <p>A third record is from the quarry at Tehna, north of Minieh, and is another
                        monument de noting the presence of the III. Cyrenaica legion, which had been
                        in Judea during Hadrian's Jewish war, in Egypt. It reads, "For the safety
                        and victory of the Emperor Domitian Caesar Augustus Germanicus, to Zeus the
                        supreme, a vow is made by Titus Egnatius Tiberianus centurion of the III.
                        Cyrnenaic legion at the quarries of the place from which the pavement of the
                        city of Alexandria has come."</p>
                    <p>In the Revue Archéologique this year, vol. I p. 874 81, M. Salomon Reinach
                        published a new statuette of Aphrodite in the possession of M. Dattari of
                        Cairo. It is one more of the nu- merous specimens of fairly executed copies
                        of Greek masterpieces which appear to have been executed by Greek artists in
                        Egypt, who doubt- less found a ready sale for these replicas among their
                        wealthy compatriots there.</p>
                    <p>The statuette which unfortunately wants both the head and feet is just 1 foot
                        high, and is closely allied in design to the Aphrodite of the celebrated
                        "Aphrodite and Eros" of the Vatican. This is a well-known type of the
                        goddess wherein the drapery supported by the right hand covers the right leg
                        and loins, passing upwards over the left arm.</p>
                    <p>There are several other copies of the group extant, or of the goddess alone,
                        that of the Vatican dating from A. D. 150. The Dattari statuette carries
                        back the date of the original which it represents so as to make it
                        reasonable to regard it as dating from the 4th Century B. C. Probably the
                        first statne was by Praxi- tiles as it resembles the Cuidus Aphrodite, and
                        M. Reinach gives reasons for thinking the original was a Praxtilean work in
                        bronze erected at Thespiae.</p>
                    <p>It appears that another replica of what must have been a celebrated statue of
                        Aphro- dite also emanated from Egypt. This is the exquisite torso
                        representing the goddess in the act of loosing her sandal, now in the musuem
                        of the Duke of Arenburg, for M. J. de Mot, who has for the first time
                        illustrated it by photography, tells us it came from the neighbourhood of
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>This type of the deity was common among statuettes both of stone and bronze
                        and many examples may be found in the more complete collections of copies of
                        ancient statuary. The Numismatic Museum in Brussels possesses a splendid
                        specimen in bronze, and one of the finest examples has just been published
                        in M. de Ridder's catalogue of the De Clerc ancient bronzes, Figure 91.</p>
                    <p>There are two forms illustrative of the motive, one in which the body is
                        balanced upon the right foot with no other support, another where the left
                        hand rests upon a vase, or some similar object. M. de Mot's photograph of
                        the Alexandrian specimen may be found in the Revue Archéologique 1903. II.

                    <p>A word of thanks is due to the Editor for improving these papers by dividing
                        them into sections, and so not only making them more readable, but also
                        relieving them from the appearance of incongruity which the passing abruptly
                        from one subject to another of an entirely different nature is apt to cause
                        them to assume. How one may begin to write on some "trifle light as air" and
                        end by dealing with a most serious and difficult question can be easily
                        understood by anyone who sits down quietly to think.</p>
                    <p>For unless the mind is trained to concentra- tion it is no easy matter to
                        think out fairly and squarely some of the problems which will present
                        themselves in the most trivial matters of daily life and persistently cause
                        you to wonder why this, that or the other. A question asked me a few days
                        ago by a young Italian friend led me to review under the net a deci- sion I
                        had formed many years ago on the subs ject of his enquiry. Never let
                        decisions on important points be final, but as occasion offers just reflect
                        as to whether some fresh revelation should not cause you to modify your
                        views and bring them more in harmony with what you may feel now to be nearer
                        the truth. In other words, keep your mind open to conviction.</p>
                    <p>Now for the question. My friend abruptly asked me, apropos of nothing in
                        particular, "What is the best religion ?" I replied without hesitation, "I
                        suppose you mean the best form of religion? If so I would say the one which
                        best enables you to give expression to the highest aspirations of which your
                        nature is capable. Don't trouble yourself about creeds and dogmas; select
                        the form of worship you like best, but always remember that religion- true
                        religion is entirely untramelled by these minor details and is a thing quite
                        apart from them."</p>
                    <p>It needs little thought to discover how easy it is to justify this position.
                        One has only to reflect upon the variety that goes to make up harmony, and
                        to carry the principle to the mind of man, to see at once that a form of
                        religion acceptable to all is a sheer im- possibility. And not only that,
                        but so-called vital and fundamental doctrines which training and
                        surroundings commend to one type of mind, are totally repugnant to others. I
                        can think of no better example of variety in harmony than that furnished by
                        a well-trained orchestra delighting the ear by the perfect blending of the
                        different sounds from the instruments played upon.</p>
                    <p>But imagine for a moment that the trom- bone player conceived that his

                        thought that noise alone was music, and the shrill piccolo was heard now and
                        then in the din. Where would be the harmony? Exactly where it is in much of

                        one, and the man who goes to nature and "looks up through nature to nature's
                        God" may be as truly religious a man as he who is most active on church

                        sensible of the value of collective, as well as individual, effort. Nothing
                        is much more to be desired than the meeting together of God's children for
                        united prayer and praise, and it is quite possible to join in a service the
                        form of which one disap- proves and to hear distasteful doctrines preach-
                        ed, and yet to come away with the feeling that it has been good to be
                        there.</p>
                    <p>I hope what I have written may catch the eye of the writer of a most
                        disgraceful letter which appeared a few days ago in a Cairo news- paper.
                        Ignorance and intolerance are by no means confined to narrow-mind bigots, as
                        this shameful effusion clearly shows. I hope it will be treated with the
                        contempt it de- serves, and that no one will be tempted to answer so vile an
                        attack on the Bible. No one who appreciates the value of ancient literature,
                        to say the least, could have penned such a letter, and only the crassest
                        ignorance could have inspired it.</p>
                    <p>We live in the 20th century, but many people seem to imagine that while in
                        science, art, and literature the world is constantly pro- gressing, in
                        religion no advance has been made, and that the old doctrines of the 19th
                        and even the 18th centuries form the staple food that ministers serve out to
                        their congregations nowadays. But in reality nothing could be more striking
                        than the change that has taken place even within my own recollection.</p>

                    <p>The Paris Matin publishes the following ap- preciation of the debates in the
                        Chamber of Deputies on the question of Egypt vis-à-vis the Anglo-French
                        Agreement. The writer is M. H. Harduin, the well-known French publicist
                        :--</p>
                    <p>Au cours de la discussion qu'a soulevée à la Chambre le traité
                        franco-anglais, il a été bean- coup parlé de nos droits en Egypte, mais les
                        orateurs ont négligé de se demander ce que peuvent valoir exactement des
                        droits qu'on n'a pas l'intention ou la possibilité d'exercer.</p>
                    <p>Il faudrait s'habituer à ne pas faire, dans les cas semblables, du sentiment
                        mais des affaires. Il faudrait considérer que, pour une nation, le droit
                        n'existe réellement que quand il s'appuie sur la force., Autrement c'est un
                        article de luxe dont on aurait tort de s'en- combrer.</p>
                    <p>L'Allemagne, depuis longtemps, avait re- noncé aux droits qu'elle prétendait
                        avoir sur l'Alsace. Pourtant ces droits sont devenus très valables le jour
                        où la force les a rendus tels.</p>
                    <p>En ce qui concerne l'Egypte, si, demain, les circonstances permettaient que
                        nous nous y établissions à la place des Anglais, le fait que nous avons plus
                        ou moins abandonné nos droits aujourd'hui serait sans aucune importance. Su-
                        bitement, ces droits redeviendraient incontes- tables et parfaitement
                        légitimes.</p>
                    <p>Nous ne perdons pas grand'chose, par consé- quent, en cédant contre des
                        avantages, si avantages il y a, quelque chose qui n'a qu'une valeur toute
                        platonique. C'est faire de la poli- tique pratique.</p>
                    <p>Le véritable sacrifice n'est pas celui auquel nous consentons actuellement,
                        c'est celui que nous avons fait, le cœur léger, quand nous repoussames la
                        proposition de l'Angleterre nous offrant d'occuper l'Egypte de compte à
                        demi.</p>
                    <p>Alors nous fùmes imprévoyants et vraiment insoucieux de nos droits. Mais il
                        s'agissait, pour l'opposition, d'accomplir un acte très im- portant, qui
                        était d'embêter un ministère. Et le ministère a été embêté. Ce résultat, on
                        en conviendra, présentait un bien plus grand. intérêt que notre

                    <p>An article in the "Year Book of the German Army and Navy" tries to justify
                        the ever- increasing outlay on the land and sea forces of Germany by drawing
                        attention to the dangers which threaten Germany from the side of Russia. In
                        fact, Russia is said to be intent on carrying out three separate ideas:
                        firstly, Russia wishes to seize Constantinople; second- ly, Russia hopes to
                        unite all the Slav races; and, thirdly, Russia hopes to be able to seize
                        trom Germany all that part of Eastern Prussia which extends as far as the
                        mouth of the Vistula. The writer of the article referred to regards war as
                        unavoidable between Germany and Russia, and favours such a war during the
                        lifetime of the Emperor of Austria, and while Russia is involved in its
                        present difficulties. The Russ says that Germany would find a war with
                        Russia a very dangerous pastime, espe cially as the German military critic
                        confesses that Russia's strength in Europe has been scarcely touched or
                        affected by the war with Japan.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN IRRIGATION.</head>
                    <p>General Fischer, writing in the Asiatic Quarterly Review on Indian water
                        supply and irrigation policy, denounces the Irrigation Commission for having
                        done absolutely nothing to promote irrigation and prevent famines. Perhaps
                        the most interesting part of his paper is the following project for the
                        irrigation of Egypt:-</p>
                    <p>"No doubt much, very much, has been done in Egypt for irrigation, but it is
                        very doubtful whether more might not have been done with its many natural
                        advantages and its abundant water-supply, and far more economically. For
                        instance, if the outlet of the Victoria Nyanza Lake had been raised only
                        half a yard, sufficient water could have been easily stored in that basin to
                        supply the whole country with water, and to maintain a good navigable canal
                        through- out its entire length, with a branch down to the Red Sea; then
                        would there have been no occasion to construct any of those large dams in
                        different parts of the country for supplying water to the lands here and
                        there, but the whole might easily have been made into one grand project, and
                        so reduce the cost of main- tenance and establishments.</p>
                    <p>The drainage of the sudd might have been effected at the same time by cutting
                        through the upper cataracts, and a very large extent of laud recovered for
                        cultivation immediately under the Victoria Nyanza Lake, having the cheapest
                        facilities of access to all the markets of the world. Such a work would
                        probably greatly help to supply Lancashire with cotton in a more certain
                        manner than America is ever likely to do.</p>

                    <head>Our London Letter.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</byline>
                    <dateline>London, November 11.</dateline>
                    <p>In the regretted absence of the Prime Minis ter from the Guildhall Banquet,
                        the Foreign Secretary was the only member of the Cabinet who could
                        adequately take his place. Ever since the first burst of premature
                        enthusiasm over Mr. Balfour's Southampton statement faded away, there has
                        been a growing suspicion that British diplomacy has suffered signal dis-
                        comfiture over the North Sea outrage, that the "settlement" has settled
                        nothing, and that Russian brutality and insolence have triumphed all along
                        the line. How far the suspicion has been a just one can only be proved by
                        events, wherefore Ministers must not be surprised if the public are not yet
                        wholly satisfied as to the desirability of taking the vindication of British
                        honour and the avenging of British blood out of British hands. Since,
                        however, the Govern- ment have elected to appear as litigants before an
                        international tribunal, we must accept the situation and await the result.
                        In the mean- time, we are bound to admit that Lord Lansdowne makes out a
                        better case-in theory and, so to say, on paper-than was generally believed
                        to exist for the action of the Govern ment. The public have been in doubt
                        about two points: first, whether the officers detained as witnesses were not
                        merely men of straw, selected precisely because they could give no
                        information of any real value; and, secondly,. whether, in the event of
                        culpability being proved, either they, or their Admiral, or any- body would
                        ever be punished. That doubt has been strengthened by the swaggering of the
                        Russian Press, and, we are bound to add, by the Tsar's latest telegram to
                        Admiral Rozsjdest- vensky and the reported promotion of that officer. Lord
                        Lansdowne now states that the Government have received a distinct assurance
                        that the officers detained are those actually implicated, and, further, that
                        if, from the investigation, other officers are found to have been culpable
                        they, too, will be punished.</p>
                    <p>The site for the Gladstone Memorial, to the west of St. Clement Danes Church
                        in the Strand, has been agreed upon between the improvements committee of
                        the County Council and the First Commissioner of Works; so that we may make
                        up our minds to seeing it there before long. The arrangements do not seem
                        likely seriously to interfere with the traffic; Mr. Gladstone will, at
                        least, prove less obstructive than the Griffin, I imagine. Curiosity will
                        now be concerned chiefly with the details of the memorial, which, in Mr.
                        Hamo Thorny- croft's hands, will doubtless be a worthy one. Mr. Gladstone is
                        to wear the robes of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That may arouse fiscal
                        controversies, perhaps, but it was undoubt edly as a financier that he was
                        most distinguished in statesmanship, and the costume is the most
                        appropriate, probably, that could have been selected. Had the choice fallen
                        on Mr. Gladstone as orator, there would have been a choice only between
                        Ciceronian fancy dress and the matter-of-fact costume of the nineteenth
                        gentury, of which we have too many disheartening examples in stone and metal
                        as it is.</p>
                    <p>An eminently satisfactory report of the pros- perity of the Uganda
                        Protectorate has just ap- peared. General progress has been shown, and while
                        the revenue for the year ended March 31, 1904, showed an increase of some 25
                        per cent. on the previous year, the expenditure decreased by something like
                        8 per cent. In every direction but one a substantial improve- ment has been
                        recorded. The exception is the sleeping sickness epidemic, which continues
                        with unabated intensity.</p>
                    <p>If the German Courts want to make the crime of lèse-majesté ridiculous they
                        will in- dulge in a few more such convictions as that of Adelbert Grzabka,
                        who, being of the mature age of 13, has been sentenced to three months'
                        imprisonment for speaking disrespectfully of the Kaiser. He actually
                        "stamped with both his feet" when the name of the Emperor was mentioned, and
                        I suppose the Court which condemned him considered that he had shaken the
                        German Throne. Perhaps the most signi ficant feature in the whole business
                        is that little Adelbert does not even enjoy the distine- tion of being the
                        youngest child who has been punished for this crime, and one wonders whether
                        the German Courts will direct their Joyal zeal against the very babies in
                        arms. Once again there are numerous angry or irritable protests against the
                        inconvenience to business resulting from the Lord Mayor's Show. The
                        protestants, with whom one cannot but feel a considerable amount of
                        sympathy, have rather gone out of their way this year to condemn what they
                        describe as the tawdry nature of yesterday's pageant; but, as a matter of
                        fact, Alderman Pound's procession bore favourable comparison with not a few
                        of its immediate predecessors. Perhaps the civic anthorities will take note
                        of the suggestion of reviving the water pageant on November 9, <cb n="2"/>
                        and thus leaving the streets free to the busi- ness man. By next year the
                        County Council steamboats may be running, and if the powers at Spring
                        gardens could be induced to lend their costly fleet to the Chief Magistrate
                        some- thing novel might result.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be the case with the ordinary railways, the electric railways of
                        England seem to have little to learn from America judging by the latest
                        achievement of the "Twopenny Tube." The record has just been established of
                        despatching thirty-one trains an hour from each end of the system, i.e.,
                        from the Bank and Shepherd's Bush. This is at the rate of one train in less
                        than two minutes. In actual working it is believed to be a world's record,
                        having regard to the fact that the trains were despatched from one platform.
                        The New York elevated railway claims to have a two-minute service, but it is
                        declared by experts that the achievement of the London tube has never been
                        equalled on the American line.</p>
                    <p>The applications for membership of the London Stock Exchange with the object
                        of forestalling the new rules which, if approved, come into operation in a
                        few weeks, yesterday numbered forty-one. It is fully realised that under the
                        limitations imposed by the new rules a seat on the Stock Exchange will
                        become very valuable..</p>
                    <p>On the New York Exchange the method now to be adopted in London is in vogue,
                        and seats there fetch from £12,000 up to as much as £20,000 in brisk times.
                        It is not likely that anything like these figures will be obtained in
                        London, because in New York the membership. does not exceed about 1,000,
                        whereas in Lon- don it is about 4,700, and may increase further, though only
                        to a limited extent.</p>
                    <p>At the Trocadero the pros and cons of Channel tunnels were again thrashed out
                        at the monthly dinner of the London Chamber of Commerce. The real objection
                        is not, of course, any difficulty in preventing invasion through the tunnel,
                        but the line of supply which it would afford to an enemy who had landed
                        successfully by sea and seized the entrance. This danger necessitates either
                        holding the tunnel by a fortress as impregnable as Gibraltar or bringing our
                        Army up to the level of those on the Continent. Yet it is difficult to see
                        why it is beyond the resource of science to flood the tunnel in case of
                        having to abandon the opening, or to mine it so heavily as to make it
                        useless as a line of supply.</p>
                    <p>Dorset automobilists are agitating for an alteration of their present
                        registration letters, "B. F.," and at the county council meeting at
                        Dorchester on Tuesday, Lord Portman presid- ing, a letter was read from the
                        Automobile Club on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Goodden stated that many owners <cb n="3"/>many members it is
                        supposed that billiard- marking opens up a new career for women. Anyone,
                        however, who has frequented ladies' clubs is aware that the lady
                        billiard-marker has been in evidence for years, for the excellent reason
                        that the young and nice-looking male expert would be as certain to provoke
                        flirta- tion as would the lady marker in a man's club. And, further, the
                        timid lady novice would be frightened away from the billiard-room alto-
                        gether by the presence of a skilled male exponent.</p>
