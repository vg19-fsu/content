                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>WHITE AND COLOURED LABOUR</head>
                    <p>The seriousness of the economic problem which arises when Eastern and Western
                        labour come into conflict was discussed in "Public Opinion" last week,
                        especially' in relation to Japan and the United States. But the same problem
                        is to the front in Australia and in South Africa. Take Australia-it has
                        adopted A deliberate policy of exclusion for the Japanese. Mr. C-R W. Bean,
                        of Sydney, writing to the " Spectator," says "A Western and Oriental race
                        cannot live together in Australia. The resolve of Australians to keep their
                        country white is of an intensity undreamed of in England." May there not he
                        something, he asks, in the fact that "while the Briton who never meets the
                        Oriental declares that East and West can live side by side, his own race
                        wherever in the world it meets an Oriental people refuses to live si"P by
                        side with it 1 The Englishman in India is the strongest case in point. "No
                        one," he adds, "can deny the danger of an Oriental overflow. There are some
                        three million odd whites in Australia inhabiting three million square miles.
                        To the North,at its very gates, up to within a day's sail are eight hundred
                        million Orientals.' The weakest point that I can see in the Australian case
                        h in the moral problem. Have we, so few, a right to keep out these hordes
                        and save Australia for ourselves f But then-Is it for ourselves or for the
                        forty million white men to come after, and for the perpetuation of our race
                        and the ideals we believe in, and, above all, for our children ? Are they to
                        look to ns for a healthy home-or for that mixed horror f Senator Pulsford,
                        commenting on this letter says that "no one would dream from reading it that
                        Japan had actually made repeated offers to Australia to enter int4> some
                        treaty or arrangement controlling the emigration of Japanese to Australia so
                        as to secure to Australia everything she desired, and that Australia,
                        instead of availing herself of the courteous offers made by Japan, preferred
                        to deal With the whole subject of the restriction of immigration in a way
                        which was clearly shown to be offen sive to the public spirit of the people
                        of Japau." There are many in Australia, adds fh'e Senator, "who do view with
                        doep regret tho fact that certain Australian legislation tonds to create
                        Empire difficulties that more courteous methods would obviate." In the
                        Transvaal the problem is compli cated by the fact that the antipathy to
                        ooloured men in this oase means antipathy to members of the same Empire, for
                        the coloured men who have invaded Natal ami the Transvaal, and whose coming
                        has been resisted, are Indiana Lord Selborne says there can be no mistaking
                        the strength of the unanimous demand oi all sections of tho white community
                        iq the Transvaal for the passing of an Acl making Registration for Asiatics
                        compulsory The oflensive part, however, of the Registration Act is that
                        which provides for the identification of holders of certificates by means of
                        fingerprint impressions. General Botha, it is said, will try and adopt some
                        less dffensive means of registration. But at bottom the objection to the
                        Asiatic in the Transvaal and Natal is economic. They take away business from
                        the whites, and that is a ground of oftence. </p>

                        <p>Sir Alfred Jones has received the following letter from Sir Daniel
                            Morris, the Imperial Commissioner for Agriculture in the West Indies:-"
                            You will rejoice to hoar that the prospects of cotton for next year are
                            favourable. We have had nice rains, and the cotton growers are planting
                            first-class seeds supplied them by this Department." A system has been
                            started in Jamaica, under the auspices of Sir Alfred Jones to encourage
                            cotton growing by the peasants. An experiment made last year was very
                            successful, and it, is hoped that this year, when many acres will be
                            planted, the same success will be achieved. An advance is made to the
                            extent of £10 per acre, the crop being taken as security. This system is
                            to some extent modelled upon Lord Cromer's policy in this country which
                            was a conspicuous success. </p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER'S GRANT<lb/>HALF HEARTED OPPOSITION</head>
                    <p>Mr. W. Redmond (N, Clare, East) in opposing the grant of £50,000 to Lord
                        Cromer, said that he was not actuated by any personal motive or fooling
                        against Lord Cromer. The reward of Lord Cromer should be derived from
                        Egyptian sources and not from the taxpayers of this country. Was Lord Cromer
                        to receive £50,000 because instead of carrying out the policy of evacuation,
                        according to his orders, in Egypt, he had made that country into a British
                        province? Lord Cromer was to be rewarded for doing that which could be
                        characterised only as false and fraudulent in the face of the civilised
                        world.(Opposition cries of "Shame" and general cries of "Withdraw.") Apart
                        from public works and from the regulation of the finances of Egypt, Iord
                        Cromer's work in that country had been singularly unsuccessful and
                        unfortunate. eCries of dissent). The position in Egypt was the same as in
                        Ireland. Every position of powor and emolument was held by Englishmen, while
                        the Egyptians were hewers of wood and drawers of water in their own country.
                        As to education, the Egyptians believed that the policy had been to keep the
                        masses in a state of ignorance-(loud Ministerial cries of "No, no")-so as to
                        render their political advancement an impossibility. (Renewed cries of "No,
                        no.") This was one of the occasions on which it was difficult for him to
                        ascertain what was the real difference between Liberals and Unionists.
                        (Laughter.) He denied that the Department of Justice in Egypt had been put
                        on a satisfactory basis. He objected to a subscription being got up for a
                        man whose administration would be regarded as a blot upon the Empire. (Cries
                        of "Oh, oh.") </p>
                    <p>Mr. Beaumont (L )-What rot ! </p>
                    <p>Mr. William Redmond did not think that that was an expression which should
                        come from an English gentleman, but one was not surprised when one
                        recollected that the hon. member was a relative of Lord Clanricarde. (Loud
                        Nationalist cheers.) . </p>
                    <p>Mr. Beaumont rose amidst, a storm of Nationalist cheers. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the hon. member wns not entitled to make such remarks. Did
                        he rise to a point of order ? (Cheers.) </p>
                    <p>Mr. Beaumont said he did. He was quite willing to withdraw his remark.
                        (Cheers). It was made in regard to the state of affairs in Egypt, and not in
                        regard to what the hon. member said. (Cheers.)- </p>
                    <p>Mr. W. Redmond said it did not matter what was meant It was aimed at any
                        system of Home Rule and self-government. It wns notorious that the efforts
                        of Iord Egypt-(loud laughter) - he meant Lord Cromer - were against the
                        freedom of the Egyptian people. (Cheers and laughter.) </p>
                    <p>Mr. Kettle (N, East Tyrone) said if it was true that Lord Cromer was a poor
                        man it was to his credit, but that was no reason for taking £50,000 out of
                        the pockets of people who were infinitely poorer. (Nationalist cheers.) </p>

                            GAZETTE"</head>
                        <p>Sir-There is a lot of talk of disaffection amongst the natives in Egypt,
                            but this imaginary state of affairs is hardly due to the real Egyptian
                            who is quite a peacable sort of person. I will not say that it is due to
                            the Berberine, but really the attitude of these is unsupportable and
                            becomes worse daily ; every house has its hand of Berberine loafers on
                            benches or chairs outside, and their deliberations last well into the
                            night and are exasperating to householders. There can be no reasonable
                            objection to domestics discussing their affairs when their work is over,
                            and incidentally their employers shortcomings, but that they should
                            encumber the pavement and disturb the rest of those residing in the
                            vicinity is insupportable. 1 have seen in your columns a well deserved
                            justification of the efforts of the Cairo City Police in the face of
                            huge difficulties but at the same time I think this is somewhat
                            discounted by their cessation of the recent purging of the city of
                            undesirables and unemployed of the black persuasion. In writing this I
                            have strong hopes that the police will make an effort and resume their
                            crusade against the Berberine pest, from which we all suffer, and. carry
                            it through to the bitter end, as the matter is sufficiently serious and
                            the discharged servants, saices, and even men in employment are disgrace
                            fully insolent. , Yours faithfully </p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER<lb/>INTERESTING CHARACTER SKETCH</head>
                    <p>The following interesting character sketch of Lord Cromer appears in the
                        "Daily Chronicle" of the 30th ult. from the pen of "Anglo- Egyptian" :-</p>
                    <p>It was Sunday sfternoon at the "Zoo" in Cairo. A little family party-father,
                        mother, nurse and child - came strolling along. There was no state-no
                        escort, no footman, no Consular "Cavasses" sparkling in gold and white, such
                        as run, with their significant slaves, in front of the meanest foreign
                        Consul in the streets of Cairo. It was just a little middle class party out
                        for their weekly holiday- enjoying the sunshine, gazing at the strange
                        animals-immensely concerned and interested in the baby-"Monsieur, Madame et
                        Bébé"- the same group that you see wandering happily on Sundays under the
                        plane trees in the Champs Elysées, or under the limes in any little German
                        town. The man was grey-haired, but still keen-eyed, strongly built and
                        bronzed of face. He seemed more anxious about the baby than either the
                        mother or the nurse. </p>
                    <p>PHARAOH OR SLAVE ?</p>
                    <p>That was my first sight of Lord Cromer- three years ago ; and it gave me the
                        key to his power over Egypt. Most Anglo-Indians believe that you must govern
                        Orientals by display, and make themselves immensely ridiculous in the
                        process. "The East bows low in deep disdain"-but it is not in the least
                        impressed. All our Durbars leave them untouched. A white man in a frock
                        coat, crowned with roses, is scarcely less absurd to them than to us. They
                        can beat us so easily at that game. Lord Cromer's was quite another form of
                        triumph. It was a victory of simplicity. The gewgaws of power-the balls and
                        banquets, the palaces and attendants - were left to the Khedive and the
                        Foreign Consuls. Lord Cromer kept the reality. But it was a terrrible life,
                        and there is no wonder that he finds himself now, at sixty- five, condemned
                        to an idleness which is the price of years of over-strain. At the end of his
                        time Lord Cromer had concentrated in his hands almost every thread of the
                        Government over 10,000,000 of human beings. Warned by a terrible illness, he
                        had entirely given up all social life, which was charmingly looked after by
                        his beautiful wife. "Early to bed and early to rise" was his iron law. Every
                        morning he would see all his "Advisers"-the real Ministry of Englishmen, who
                        control the shadowy Egyptian Cabinet. Everything of importance came up to
                        him. He missed nothing-mastered everything. Then, in the afternoon, a drive,
                        and again, at six, another set of audiences, a plain dinuer, and bed at
                        nine. It was the life of a galley-slave. But be loved it with the passion of
                        a true ruler. Nothing but a complete breakdown would have ever torn him from
                        it. Think of his Egyptian record. Indian Viceroys rale for five years, and
                        then, if they are wise, give way to others. Tropical Governors rarely remain
                        beyond six, and even then come home with broken constitutions. Egypt, lived
                        in the greater part ot the year, is almost as trying as India. But Cromer
                        stayed it out for twenty- four years on his second stay. Before that he had
                        been seven years in India, and one before in Egypt. Thirty-two continuous
                        years of Oriental rule ! It is the biggest English record in that line.
                        Egypt gradually became his only love. Others came and went. He stayed on. He
                        refused the Viceroyality of India. He rejected the Foreign Ministry of the
                        British Empire. With that Teutonic thoroughness which all the Barings have,
                        he stuck to his one job, and preferred rather to do that thoroughly than to
                        tinker at twenty others. He made his mistakes, like other men ; but, after
                        all, what an Egypt he found, and what an Egypt he left! "READ MY REPORTS."
                        The next time I saw Lord Cromer after that glimpse in the Cairo garden was
                        in the British Consulate. There he lived and had his being.
                        Characteristically of his rule, the house he inhabited was away from the
                        centre of Cairo-a big Victorian building with a front garden and drive like
                        a suburban villa-a house far less pretentious than that of many an Egyptian
                        pasha. But though.it was remote, every Cairo driver-every fezzed "cabby" on
                        those pretty little two horsed victorias that make life in Cairo so pleasant
                        and elegant for the English visitor-know his way directly. "The Lord's ?" he
                        asked with a swarthy grin- most of the drivers are Nubians-and with a proud
                        crack of the whip you were bowled off at a reckless and dangerous pace. It
                        was a high-ceilinged, sombre room I was ushered into, and the man I had seen
                        at the Zoo was sitting at a table writing. After a few words of greeting he
                        sat back from his papers and scanned me with a pair of very formidable eyes.
                        "Have you read my reports?" I had to confess that I had not. Lord Cromer
                        instantly rang a bell, and a clerk appeared. "Bring my reports," he said.
                        The clerk disappeared, and came hack in a few minutes staggering under the
                        burden. "Read those and come back again." I staggered away, read them, and
                        came back. It was the beginning of a friendship. It was also the first step
                        -to any real knowledge of Egypt. He has always been very proud of his
                        reports, and quite rightly. No one should criticise Lord Cromer's rule in
                        Egypt without </p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p> THE ENGLISH WAY. It was a wonder how he ever found time to write them.
                        Knowing what it is to produce a book, I asked him once how he did it. "It is
                        quite simple," he said, "I write them on my trips up the Nile." Every year
                        in February or March he would leave Cairo and embark on a steamer up to the
                        First, and sometimes the Second Cataract. Sitting on deck all day, he would
                        write his Annual Report. It was the only place where he could be safe from
                        intruders. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer went to Egypt a poor man and came away a poor man. Other Barings
                        have heaped up or thrown away great wealth. Lord Cromer has made a nation
                        fabulously wealthy, but he has reaped no profit himself beyond the salary he
                        has spent at Cairo. The land values of Egypt have gone up 150 per cent., but
                        it has been the iron role of the Egyptian Civil Service that no man among
                        them should profit by one penny from that, Rather they have lost by the rise
                        in the price living. </p>
                    <p>He is the last to ask any credit for that. Rightly, he regards it as the
                        proper English rule—the rule for all Englishmen in such positions.
                        Personally, he wishes, I feel sure, for no reward now. The "wreath of wild
                        olive" would be the best prize for such services. But cash and public
                        dinners are our English way; and that way must be followed. </p>
                    <p>Jet Liberals think seriously before they throw serious blame on such a rule.
                        There are spots in the sun; and Lord Cromer at the end was a tired man. But
                        on the whole, his record is the finest example of Liberal principles applied
                        to empire. To discredit Lord Cromer is to encourage a ruler of a very
                        different type. </p>

                    <p>A fire broke out on Sunday night in the Egyptian Cavalry stables in a masonry
                        building containing straw bedding. The call reached the Cairo Fire station
                        at 10 p.m. and a steamer from Waili station was immediately on the spot
                        followed by a steamer from Cairo. When the brigade arrived the fire had
                        obtained a complete hold on the building and its highly inflammable
                        contents, and Captain Jones, who was in charge, directed his efforts towards
                        the isolation of the conflagration and the prevention of its spread to an
                        adjoining cold store which happily escaped damage. | The water pressure was,
                        poor but thanks to </p>
                    <p>the timely and devoted efforts of the Tanzim Department, who supplied water
                        carts, a fair pressure was maintained and although some 250 tons of forage
                        were alight the fire was restrained and mastered, but only after immense
                        efforts. </p>
                    <p>The damage is estimated at £1,000 and at the time of writing a steamer is
                        still playing on the smouldering debris which in the lower layers is still
                        at white heat owing to the nature of the fuel which provoked the outbreak.
                        The Egyptian troops are removing the debris as it cools but considerable
                        labour is still entailed. </p>

                    <p>A Cairo correspondent suggests that at the present time, when so many people
                        are short of money, it would be an opportune moment for those dividend
                        paying Banks and Trading Companies that distribute their profits annually,
                        to declare an interim payment now. By so doing he considers that the present

                        forced to sell to pay their way, would be in a position to hold their shares
                        and gradually adjust their liabilities. </p>

                    <head>THE VANITY OF RAMESES II.</head>
                    <p>In a lecture at King's College last week, on the excavations of the Egypt
                        Exploration Fund at Beir el Bahari, Professor Naville said one of the great
                        annoyances of Egyptian explorers was to find the name of Rameses II. on many
                        of the antiquities, some of which must have existed a thousand years before
                        he was born. He apparently had always busied himself by having his name put
                        on everything he possibly could, when it had no right and no business there. </p>
                    <p>In an interview appeaing in the "Evening News" Mr. Naville said that "Ramses
                        II. did not deserve to be called the Great." The more we discover about him,
                        the more we realise what a pious fraud he was. "His vanity was colossal, and
                        he was not content with the fulsome praise of his own people. Being a man of
                        broad ideas, he arranged that posterity as well should share his own opinion
                        of his greatness. </p>
                    <p>"To this end he conceived the happy notion of causing his name to be
                        inscribed on every temple, statue, and monument that he imagined would stand
                        the test of time. </p>
                    <p>LEAVING HIS MARK. </p>
                    <p>"His plan succeeded only too well. For many years, in consequence of it,
                        explorers have united in deciding that he must have been a great king. </p>
                    <p>"He wished to dazzle posterity, and he did so. But now we are beginning to
                        find him out. Some of the antiquities on which his name appears must have
                        existed quite 1,000 years before he was born. </p>
                    <p>"Occasionally he even went to the length of erasing the name formerly borne
                        by a statue and substituting his own. He was never particular whose name it
                        was that he erased. </p>
                    <p>"Frequently it was that of one of his predecessors. One wonders what the

                    <p>In an interview with a representative of the "Daily Chronicle," Hafez Bey
                        Awad,

                        and editor of "Al Minbar" said : - </p>
                    <p>"Those who would correctly appreciate the political situation in Egypt must
                        understand that there are several currents operating. There is the extreme
                        section which clamours for complete autonomy. This section, if I may so put
                        it, would like to run before it can walk. Their policy is to demand
                        immediate evacuation, so that the Egyptian people may assume entire control
                        of the affairs of the country. Then at the other extreme, there is the
                        policy advocated by the Occupation Press and party, which desires that the
                        present régime may continue indefinitely. These latter are not Egyptians,
                        but Syrians, who have no right to speak for Egypt." </p>
                    <p>"I," said M. Awad langhingly, "am an unfortunate Moderate, and the party I
                        represent does not agree with either of the extremist sections. At the same
                        time I have no hesitation in saying that the Moderates are not only
                        numerically the strongest party in Egypt, but they represent the substantial
                        and responsible element in the population. </p>
                    <p>TO WORK WITH THE BRITISH. "What, you ask, is our poley? We say that the
                        Egyptian people should work in harmony with the British authorities, and in
                        such a way as to develop the institutions that were established by Lord
                        Dufferin in 1882-83. We are not advocating anything violent or
                        revolutionary. We desire for the present the development of the embryo
                        constitution which was inaŭgurated, or, I might say, invented, by Lord
                        Dufferin. At the present time, as everyone knows who has studied Egyptian
                        politics, the institutions which have a semblance of a representative
                        character are without legislative power. We Nationalists would like such
                        powers conferred upon these institutions. We do not, of course, ask for full
                        Parliamentary government at once, such as you have in England - that would
                        be going too far-but it is our ultimate object. Our great desire is to work
                        hand-in-hand with the English if the English will work hand-in-hand with us
                        in developing our present institutions, For instance, one desirable reform
                        for which we are asking would be direct election by the people to the
                        Legislative Council and the General Assembly. At present the members of
                        these two bodies are elected by the provincial councils." </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's resignation and Sir Eldon Gorst's appointment having been
                        mentioned, the question naturally suggested itself, Do the Nationalists
                        anticipate any concessions in the direction of their wishes ? </p>
                    <p>"We do not know," said M. Awad. "Sir Eldon Gorst is, I think, wisely saying
                        nothing, We do not know what his intentions are, but we are hoping for some
                        improvement, and our hopes are strengthened by the fact that there is a
                        strong Liberal Government in power just now. There is, in fact, danger ahead
                        unless something is done. </p>
                    <p>" What danger, you ask ? The danger that the Moderates, who represent the
                        responsible people of the country, will, unless a considerable number of
                        their demands are satisfied, throw in their lot with the extreme section
                        That would be a calamity for England and for Egypt, which it would be
                        impossible to exaggerate. We want to avoid that calamity, and it is by
                        following our policy that it will be avoided. It must not be supposed that
                        we do not appreciate all that has been done by England for Egypt on the side
                        of its material prosperity ; our complaints are on the moral and political
                        side." </p>
                    <p>NOT MORE LETHARGIC. It has been suggested by those who take an interest in
                        Egypt's future that the Egyptian of to-day is more lethargic and
                        indifferent, and less worthy of the full rights of citizenship than his
                        countryman of the pre-Occupation period. This, M. Awad would not admit. </p>
                    <p>"There is undoubtedly," he said, "a reawakening of the national conscience,
                        and it takes the form of a widespread feeling that the people should have a
                        larger share in the government of their country than they at present
                        possess. What better answer than that can you have to the aspersions? But
                        the position is very unsatisfactory. Our just and reasonable claims have
                        been too long denied, and this feeling that I speak of is what is meant when
                        the newspapers talk about 'political unrest.' The feeling will go on
                        increasing, and, as I say, may drive moderate men to the extremist side if
                        nothing is done." </p>
                    <p>M. Awad had something to say about the educational system of the country. </p>
                    <p>"It is a superficial one," he said, "and does not bring out the young men who
                        would be able to take high positions of responsibility, Instead of England,
                        as she professed when she came to the country, preparing the people to
                        govern themselves, she is, on the contrary, retarding the process.
                        Knowledge, for instance, is imparted in two languages, English and French,
                        and it is obvious that a student's mastery of a subject cannot be so
                        thorough if he is taught in an alien tongue." </p>
                    <p>Asked in conclusion, what the success of the Nationalist movement would mean
                        to the country, M. Awad spoke out strongly. </p>
                    <p>"It means," he said, "that you will have a people thoroughly loyal and
                        thoroughly grateful to the British Government: instead of being covertly, if
                        not openly, hostile. We Nationalists-and, by the way, I may say that we have
                        not secret societies for the furtherance of our views --hold that the

                        Division, who retired on the 11th inst. with the rank of commander, would
                        have completed thirty years' service had he remained on four days longer.
                        Commander Steward, who had held the rank of lieutenant since December, 1886,
                        was midshipman of the "Monarch" at the bombardment of Alexandria and during

                        Galway since November, 1902. </p>
                    <p> The death is reported of Major St. George John Rathborne, retired list, late
                        of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, aged 60. He joined the Army Dec. 2, 1865
                        became Captain Feb. 12, 1882 ; and Major Jan. 16, 1889, retiring in that
                        rank on retired pay. As a subaltern of the 6th Regiment he served in the

                        (medal). He served with the 1st Batn. Royal Berkshire Regiment throughout
                        the Egyptian War, 1882, and was present at the surrender of Kafr Dowar
                        (medal and Khedive's star); served throughout the campaign in the Eastern

                        Tumai, (two clasps); served with the Egyptian Frontier Force in 1885-86, and

                    <p>A.C.C. v. COLDSTREAM GUARDS. </p>
                    <p>The match played on Saturday on the Alexandria Cricket Ground between the
                        A.C.C. and a team of the Coldstream Guards resulted in a very easy winner
                        for the former. Winning the toss and taking first innings Alexandria
                        immediately settled down to compile a good score and after Hay, who opened
                        the innings with Carver, had been dismissed for 4 by a somewhat doubtful
                        1.b.w. Carver and Marsden made merry with the ball, which found the boundary
                        time after time. Marsden played exceptionally well and placed his balls very
                        neatly, and some good hard hitting was seen from Carver, who was obviously
                        in form, though perhaps rather rash at times. Mainprice was most unlockily
                        out l.b.w. to the first ball he received, but Scott Dalgleish further
                        punished the Coldstream's bowlers to the tune of 51, and with five wickets
                        down the Alexandria team declared the innings closed for 259. The
                        Coldstreams fared almost worse with the bat than they did when in the field,
                        and their only player who could stand up to the bowling of Carver and
                        Prosser was Pte. Revell, who compiled more than half the total score by good
                        all round play. Five of the players were missed for a duck, and the only man
                        to reach double figures, besides Revell, was Mr. Bingham. Carver took five
                        wickets for 21 and Prosser four for 18, Appended are the scores :- </p>

                    <p>La marché a ouvert faible ot eq bnisio et l'impreeflion a été plntAt
                        défavorable pendant presque toute la séanoe. Mais, vers la fin; il s'est
                        produit une amélioration, en particulier sur les valeurs dirigeantes, et en
                        définitive l'ensemble de la cote a'fini en hausse. La note dominante a été,
                        côinme ou le pense bien, l'indécision, on l'absence d'affaires sur le mar-
                        ché de Londres qui chôme depuis samedi. On attend évidemment ponr se lancer
                        ici de voir la direction que prendront les places diri- geantes. Les
                        affaires ont été en général clairse- mées èt c'est plutôt à un retour de la
                        demnnde qu'on doit la petite reprise de la clôture qu'à des transactions
                        effectives. Ce sont les valeurs dirigeantes qui ont été le mieux tenues. La
                        National Bank, d'abord délaissée et en réaction, a été l'objet en clôture
                        d'une demande provenant du Caire. Il n'y a d'ailleurs parfeu d'échanges, les
                        détenteurs ne se contentant pas des prix offerts. Le cour* s'est maintenu à
                        19 7/8. En Agricole dont le cours s'est consolidé à 8 1/16, il y a eu du
                        mouvement et une demande assez active, sur- tout vers la fin. D'autre part,
                        la Delta Light s'avance de 9 7/8 à 9 15/16 la Privilégiée et de 8 3/4 'à 9
                        1/4 la Dividende. L'Obligation Crédit Foncier est demandée à 304 l'ancienne
                        et 262 la nouvelle. On a beauoonp remarqué des demandes en Tramways
                        d'Alexandrie, Privilégiées et Divi- dendes, qui gagnent 2 francs aux cours
                        res- pectifs de 139 1/2 et 292. C'est Bruxelles qui achète, paralt-il. A
                        signaler également la reprise de la Iiand Bank de 7 à 7 3/16 vendeurs. Le
                        motif de cette hausse n'est pas encore connu. En reprise encore la iUmleh de
                        4 1/2 à 4 5/8, la Béhéra de 20 à 20 1/4, la Delta Land de 1 11/16 h 1 8/4,

                        contraire, de 17/6 à 17/3, la Cassa di Sconlo de 34 à 88, la Banque
                        d'Athènes de 111 à 110 1/2, le ComJ>- toir de 2 11/16 k 2 5/8 l'action

                        la Building de 2 7/16 à 2 5/16, la fondateur United de 2 1/4 à 2. Pour
                        savoir si l'amélioration s'accentuera, il faut attendre la cote de Londres.

                                sensation throughout the country owing to the stupen- dous fine and

                                for conspiracy. Mr. Rockfeller was golfing when he heard the

                    <p>Horticulture haa been practiaed in Egypt for eome thousand* of yean, say* T.
                        W. B in the "Gardener*' Chronicle" for July SO, hut no remain* of thene
                        ancient garden* exist, and all the gardens of any note now existing in that
                        country are the work ôf Europeans. Mohammed Aly Pasha and his son Ibrahim,
                        in the first half of the nineteenth oentury, brought gardeners from England
                        and France to lay out the gardens on the Isle of Roda at Cairo, and these
                        became famous both for their beauty and for the collection of trees. Later,
                        Ismail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, em- ployed European gardeners and spent
                        large sums of money in constructing extensive parks around his palaces at
                        Giza and Gesireh. The public gardens of the Esbakieh, and most of the trees
                        now growing in the street* and suburban roads of Cairo, were also planted
                        under this ruler's direction. Rich Europeans and natives followed his
                        example, so that many of the best Egyptian gardens of to-day date from the
                        reign of Ismail Pasha. Since the time of occupation of the country by the
                        British, the Government has been unable to attend to any matters other than
                        those which are capable of providing revenue, and this may be also said of
                        many private persons frho before had taken an interest in horticulture, so
                        that, speaking generally, gardens in Egypt have during the last twenty-six
                        yean been greatly neglected. During the recent boom in land speculation,
                        numbers of estates were sold and out for building purposes. Of the beautifu
                        gardens on the Isle of Roda little remains excepting a few trees, which, by
                        chanoe, were not in the way of the roadmakers and builders, whilst at Giza
                        and Getiroh the only remnants are the Zoological and Palace Hotel gardens.
                        One, however, still finds beautiful but solitary specimens of exotic trees
                        which tell their osm tale of the past At the present time interest in
                        horticulture is again growing, and almost all the European resident* living
                        outside the towns have their own gardens. Native gardeners are employed
                        chiefly, although a few of the wealthier proprietors have brought met! from
                        Europe. At Alexandria there is a thriving horticultural society, which is
                        subsidised by the Government, and this association numbers amongst its
                        members the best horticulturist* and botanist* in Egypt Mr. David Fish, late
                        of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh, is the secretary. An experimental
                        station has been established ; seeds are being distributed, and exhibitions,
                        which would do credit to any society in England, are held twice each year.
                        The Khédivial Horticultural Society at Cairo is now being reorganised under
                        /the name of la Société d'Horticulture Commerciale. Commercial horticulture
                        in Egypt lias un- doubtedly a great future before it. A con- siderable and
                        profitable trade is done in cut flowers, but it is mostly in the hands of
                        small growers who give little or no attention to improving the quality of
                        the produce which they offer for sale. Roses, which may bo said to grow like
                        weeds, aro by far the commonest market flowers. Good blooms sold at Cairo
                        last Christmas for a -shilling each. Violets and Chrysanternums are also
                        largely grown for supplying, cut flowers, but Crysantbmmim flowers seldom
                        compare favourably with those ono sees in the florists' sliope of Europe and
                        America. o . Owing to the increasing number of people who spend the winter
                        months in Egypt, the florists' business must in time become an important
                        industry. The nursery trade is also capable of great development, and at
                        present a demand exists for ornamental trees and shrubs, as woll as for
                        treesfortheproductionof firewood, telegraph poles, etc. With few exceptions
                        the nurserymen content themselves with the pro- pagation of those kinds
                        which are already common in the country, and even for these the demand is
                        greater than the supply, but there are hundreds of beautiful and useful
                        plants which only need introducing to become popular. The .subjects now
                        grown aro natives of varied climes ; trees from tho Northern States of
                        America may be seen growing aide by side with others from Brazil and India.
                        Many species of Palms will grow in the open air in Egypt,and plans are in
                        preparation for the propagation, on a large soale, of these and other
                        foliage plants for export to European markets. Plants grown in the ojien air
                        are much hardier thjm those grown in hothouse*, and there appears little
                        doubt of the snooess of the enterprise, especially lyi the cost will be
                        small. Another branch of commercial horticulture in which great developments
                        may be expected in the near future is the cultivation of fruit and vege-
                        tables for export. Hitherto ootton and other purely agricultural crops have
                        oocupied the attention of cultivators, to tlio exclusion of what have been
                        regartled as garden crops. As the production of cotton is increasing in
                        other countries, people in Egypt are asking themselves whether they are wiso
                        in relying so fully on this crop. Many growers havo probably been deterred
                        from fruit ' growing by knowing that they must wait three, four, or six
                        years before receiving any returns from the trees, but they ignore the fact
                        that vege- table crops may be grown between tl|o trees al- most up to the
                        time they begin to fruit. The profits derived from the cultivation of
                        vegetables and fruit* have in soveral cases far exceeded those derived from
                        agricultural crops. </p>

                    <p>LACK OF FORESIGHT</p>
                    <p>The Second Report from tiie committee of Publio Accounts was issued last
                        week. The Committee note* that the actual gross expenditure on the Army
                        Votes during the year 1905-6 amounted to £32,043,809 11a 6d., being
                        £1,396,9Î5 8a 64 less then the estimate. On the other hand the actual
                        receipt* in aid of grants exoeeded the eetimated receipts by £799 9a 4d. The
                        total rplus on Army Aooonnta was therefore £1,834,186 17a lOd. The surplus,
                        which would have been larger by £945,000, but for the additional expenditure
                        sanctioned by the Trea- sury on the re-armament of the Artillery, says the
                        committee, is nearly twice as large as any that has occurred in Army Votes
                        for the last twenty years, and is considerably in excess of the surplus on
                        the combined votes of the Navy and Civil Servioes and Revenue Departments in
                        the year under review, where an expenditure of £89,000,000 was involved.
                        Prom the corres- pondence it must be further observed that the actual
                        surplus on March 31,1906, was almost double the amount (£691,000)
                        anticipated by the War Office in their forecast submitted to the Treasury as
                        late as March 22, 1906. The point is not only one of initial estimate but of
                        the large discrepancy between the War Office forecast (£691,000) of March
                        22, 1906, and the actual result (£1,384,136) of nine days later. So far as
                        that discrepancy is con earned, the committee had no option but to accept
                        the explanation furnished on behalf of the War Office. As regards the
                        future, they are without assuranoe that a more satisfactory result may be
                        expected. For, it has been explained to them that the military direotora
                        (who now frame Estimates and control the progress of expenditure) "are
                        transient officers who come to their post with very expensive notions, and
                        only get to know their work thoroughly by tho time they have got to go and
                        that as was admitted by the representative of the War Office, the financial
                        shortcomings now under nntice may be repeated again, possibly periodically.
                        It is not for your com mittee to indicate what administrative steps (if any)
                        are necessary to ensure an efficient system. They confine tliemselves at the
                        pres ent time to saying that the importance of accurately estimating
                        expenditure and fore- casting liabilities cannot be too strongly insist- ed
                        upon, and that they hope that the responsible Ministers of the day will take
                        every means necessary to socure that end In regard to contracts, the
                        committee states "The evidence before the War Stores Commis sion disclosed
                        bribery in connection with various contracts for supplies. In accordance
                        with the Bribery Clause inserted in all military contracts, a fine of 10 per
                        cent, is recoverable in such cases. Messrs. Cowie and Houston were thus
                        fined, and payments due to them withheld to make good the amount Your
                        Committee note that in every established case of bribery the name of the
                        firm is automatically removed from the list of Government contrac- tors.
                        Messrs. May and Co. were also fined sums amounting to £3,309, but though the
                        military authorities at tho time of cancellation of the contract hold funds
                        due to the firm in excess of that amount, the Bribery Clause was over-
                        looked, and the full amount paid over. As the advisability of instituting
                        legal proceedings in this case is now under consideration, your Committee
                        make no observation upon it The same applies in the cases of Messrs. Meyer,
                        Mr. E. Stepney, and Mr. P.T. Richards.'' LOSSES'OP VARIOUS WORKS. A sum of
                        more than £900, the committee notes, was spent, in addition to a previous
                        outlay of £3,000, in building a shed Tor the construction of an elongated
                        balloon The manufacture, however, proceeded so slowly that by tho time the
                        shod was com- pleted other buildings had arisen in the vicinity which
                        forbade the elongated bal- loon. its necessary access to the upper air. The
                        factory was therefore removed from Aldershot to Swan Plateau at an estimated
                        cost for removal and re erection of £10,000. The money spent on the shod was
                        not all wasted, as tho building !>ecaino available for military workshop,
                        but the committee consider that there was some look of fores- ight in this
                        matter. In connection with expenditure under the Military Works Loan Acta
                        the committee'* attention had been drawn by the Comptroller and Auditor-Gen-
                        eral to the following instances of the lots of public money due to
                        successive changes of policy: At East Bulford there had been a loss to the-
                        publio of between £140,000 and £150,000 in erecting a Mounted Infan- try
                        School, which was closed on the 1st of July, 1906, whilst at Tidworth nearly
                        a million pounds had been expended in building barracks for eight Infantry
                        battalions, though only four were needed. The surplus barracks were being
                        altered at to honse a Cavalry regimant and certain other troops. Near
                        Fermoy, a ram of £85,000 was expended in 1905-6 for the purchase of Moore
                        Park (848 seres, with mansion and grounds) as a site for barracks and for
                        training Mounted Infantry. The idea of a Mounted Infantry School in Ireland
                        bas now been dropped, and the mansion and outbuildings are used for the
                        purpose of providing accommodation for a field company of Royal Engineers.
                        At Stoba, where the original idea was to make a great training ground for
                        troops, but it had been given up, the War Office had spent only £66,000 out
                        of the £795,000 which had been intended at a time when it was anticipated to
                        have six Army Corps ; the land purchased being used mainly for Volunteer
                        estops. The oouunittee add that they hope to be able to roc^k this, subject
                        next year, when, on the ^Rtary Works Aota Aooonnta for 1906-7, tA^imp
                        trailer and Auditor-General will be in a position more folly to set opt the
                        total low of public money which, under the loan system now drawing to a
                        dose, has resulted from ex- penditure on projects subsequently discarded as
                        useless. </p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA MERCHANT DIVORCE.</head>
                    <p>WIFE CONFESSON AFTER 19 YEARS.</p>
                    <p>In.the Divorce court last week, Mr. William Getty) cotton merchant, of
                        Alexandria, peti- tioned for a divorce on the ground of the mis- conduct of
                        his wife, Caroljfie Bertha. Mr. Barnard, K.C., in opening the case, said the
                        parties were married on July 22,1885, and went to reside at Alexandria. In
                        1886, in consequence of some dispute, the wife's sister left the house, and
                        almost directly the wife followed, declining to live with her husband. She
                        came to England, writing her husband an affectionate letter. Despite all his
                        effort*, Mr. Getty could not ascertain his wife's whereabouts until 1888. In
                        that year Mr. Getty received information that hi* wife wa* ill, and he sent
                        her a cheque through the sister, but the cheque was returned, Mrs. Getty
                        refusing to accept aid. In 1899 Mr. Getty started proceedings for
                        restitution of conjugal righto, which be ultimately abandon- ed, agreeing to
                        a deed of separation in Novem- ber, 1900. On December 28, 1904, Mrs. Getty
                        wrote to her husband - - "My dear William,-I am a Christian Scientist I
                        became interested in science from the healing of Vera's husband, who was
                        snppoeed to have an incurable disease. I believe that God iB divine in
                        principle, light truth, and lova I want to possess the consciousness of
                        Truth, and cannot do so while I am not truthfpl with you. "I was unfaithful
                        to you nearly nineteen years ago. I regret bitterly the wrong I have done
                        you.-" v "This statement sounds bald, but it is too ugly to dress up iu fine
                        phrases. Yours vory sincerely, Carolino B. Getty." She also wrote to the
                        trustees of her mar- riage settlement saying she desired the interest of the
                        fund of about £1100 in future to be paid to her husband. Finding this could
                        not be done, she wrote to her husband "Dear'Willie,-I have tried to hand
                        over to you the settlement money, only to learn it was impossible. Then I
                        tried to have the interest of it paid over to you, and that also is
                        impossible I am told. Therefore, I write now to ask if you will let rae send
                        it on to you every six months when it is paid to me. "Do not think I mean to
                        and insult to injury. I feel the money is yours, and not mine nt alL" His
                        Lordship granted a decree nisi. </p>
