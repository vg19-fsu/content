                        that the end of the crisis is not yet, but that the present period of
                        comparative calm is but the precursor of a situation fraught with dangerous
                        possibilities.</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>The constitution of the Tribunal before which, under the Hague Convention,
                        the evidence of both sides will immediately be laid, is regarded as by no
                        means favourable to the British conceptions of the duties of belligerents
                        towards neurtals at sea. Above all, the question is asked, What will be the
                        attitude of the British Government in the event of the Tribunal finding
                        that, under all the circumstances, Admiral Rostjestvensky was justified in
                        the action he took. Such a decision would, it is believed, be received with
                        indignation at home and the hands of the Government would need to be
                        strengthened by the admission of the public of the existence of an
                        exceptionally strong Russian case in order to allay an excitement that might
                        readily bring us again to the verge of war. Even if the Tribunal decide in
                        favour of Great Britain, the ultimate pubishment of the guilty officers will
                        rest solely with the Government of the Tsar. The moment a decision is
                        arrived at the matter passes beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and it
                        is most improbable that immediate and adequate punishment will be meted out
                        by a Government convinced of the integrity and honour of its officers.
                        Another danger is that the Board of Trade inquiry, upon whosse decision the
                        British public will rely with perfect confidence, may conceivably be.
                        diametrically opposed to the decision of the International Inquiry. Such a
                        situation would be one of exceeding danger where the angry feelings of the
                        nation has been roused by an outrage of particular wantonness.</p>
                    <p>Lord Lansdowne was on firmer ground when he alluded to the cordial relations
                        with France. Who would have believed, even a couple of years ago, that in
                        the event of a serious difference between England and Russia, France would
                        be playing the part of a moderator, and using all her influence to keep her
                        Ally in the path of peace? That France has done this is unquestionable ; but
                        it is even permissible to ask if she has not done yet more. We have no right
                        to say positively, because we do not know it for certain, that France gave
                        Russia to understand, either directly or indirectly, that her sword would
                        not be drawn against England in a quarrel which was not of England's
                        seeking, and in which France had no concern except to prevent war if she
                        could. But, there are very strong grounds for the belief that France would
                        not have intervened against England , and that the fact was fully recognized
                        at St. Petersburg.</p>

                    <head>THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONVENTION</head>
                    <p>The Havas Agency publishes a telegraphic resume to-day of the speech of M.
                        Delcasse in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday. The Anglo-French Convention,
                        it will be remembered, consists of three separate decorations : the first
                        dealing with Egypt and Morocco : the second, with Siam, Madagascar, and the
                        New Hebrides : the third, with Newfoundland and West and Central Africa. All
                        points of the Convention have come in for a certain amount of criticism. It
                        is, indeed, clear that there are many Frenchmen who cannot easilt resign
                        themselves to the abandonment of that position of influence on the Nile,
                        which has been a persistent fFrench interest ever since Bonaparte (LINE
                        ILEGIBLE) That is quite human, and natural in men whose race combines the
                        sentimental with the practical in a degree unequalled, perhaps, elsewhere
                        than in France. Again, a compromise by which France abandons her historic
                        rights on the "French Shore" of Newfoundland undoubtedly severs, if with a
                        friendly hand, the last link in a long chain of historical associations. The
                        ghosts of the two hundred years of of international rivalry, of treaties
                        extending from that of Ryswick to that of Versailles, of the great struggle
                        for the dominion of the continent of North America, lurk in the privileges
                        of the French fishermen on the coast of Newfoundland. Nevertheless, business
                        is business, and Frenchmen know that well. Wherefore we do not doubt that
                        the majority of the Chamber and the Senate will adopt M. Delcasse's opinion
                        on the subject.</p>

                            on the 5th and 6th inst. the Japanese were repulsed, although during the
                            second assault a casual shell exploded in the Russian mines, killing and
                            wounding between 600 and 700 men.</p>

                        <p>Replying to the criticisms of M. Cochin concerning Egypt, M. Delcassé
                            said that it was in the interests of France that he took the
                            responsibility of signing the convention. He reminded him that the
                            Caisse de la Dette was created in 1876. Ten years later the interest was
                            reduced and the Debt unified. "We were nearing the time the redemin.
                            tion could be effected; must we refuse our aksent to the redemption of
                            the Debt? I did not think so, but I wished to get something out of our
                            assent. It is laid down that the receipts fromthe Land Tux will
                            bedevoted to the payment of the Domains Debt. Itis undeniable that this
                            financial arrangementis equally favour able to Egypt and to the
                            bondholders. The right of our directing the Antiquities Service is
                            recognised; the guarantee that nothing will happen to compromise our
                            schools is granted to us. I am therefore justified in saying that all
                            our intereste, moral and material, in Egypt are safeguarded."</p>

                            A.O.D., was playing in the barrack square at Kasr el-Nil. He strayed on

                    <head>GOLD IN EGYPT.<lb/>NILE VALLEY OPERATIONS.</head>
                    <p>We have received the following information regarding the mining operations of
                        the Nile Valley Company, Ltd.</p>
                    <p>The company have erected a 250-H.P. Babcock and Wilcox steam boiler and are
                        at the present time also making use of an Evans pump capable of throwing
                        8,000 gallons per hour in No. 1. shaft. This pump is driven by steam
                        direct.</p>
                    <p>The machinery now in motion, or being transported to the mines, consists of 5
                        stamps, the nucleus of a 10 stamp Frazer and Chalmers mill, the stamps
                        weighing. 1,240lbs. It is hoped that the mill will be at work by the Ist of
                        February. A nine-inch Cornish lift is to be used in No. 5 main.shaft.</p>
                    <p>A level has been driven on a vein at 108 feet and follows the vein for about
                        1,100 feet. No. 1 shaft is in course of sinking on the vein to 200 feety
                        when No. 2 level will be driven, the depth reached at present being about
                        155 feet. The intermediate level is driven N..to S. from No. 1 shaft at 150
                        feet, proving the existence of rich strata. Rich visible gold has been met
                        with in several places along the 108 feet level in which level winges are
                        being sunk at about every 100 feet.</p>
                    <p>No 5 shaft is being stuffed to 13X5 foet and will be the main shaft. For its
                        present depth it is stuffed and timbered for about 140 feet. It will
                        hereafter be sunk to eut the vein at an estimated depth of 500 feet,
                        Crossents are being put in and driven to interseet the vein every 100 feet
                        from 200 feet downwards. The ore at sight and at grass ready for mill. ing
                        amounts to some 4,500 tons. Retaring to the 108-feet level, a winge has been
                        sunk close to No. 1 shaft to a depth of 30 feet, passing through some very
                        rich stone. Visible gold is still showing in the north face, a couple of
                        shots here a fortnight ago bringing down stone from which some £4,000 was
                        won.</p>
                    <p>The rich strake appears to be dipping north, and it is hoped that in the
                        course of the next few days it will be picked up in the interme-dinte
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Prospects are generally very encouraging for future work. Labour is abundant,
                        and on the whole very satisfactory as to quality.</p>
                    <p>Transport, both hauling and carrying, is entirely worked by means of camels.
                        'The company hopes during the cold senson to start work by diamond drill to
                        prove the eopper proposition at Absciel and to open up other old workings
                        known to exist on the concession. In addition, prospecting will be

                    <p>We wwould draw the attention of our readers to an important notice of the
                        Alexandria Municipality which appears in another column. The cases of rabies
                        among dogs in the city are increasing to an alarming extent, and it behoves
                        the public to assist the Municipality in their endeavours to cope with the
                        danger. Only last week, we heard of a dog having bitten fice persons in one
                        house in rue d'Allemagne. One of the victims was Mr. L. Polity, of the Bank
                        of Athens, who has gone to Athens to be treated there.</p>
                    <p>We understand that as the system of poisoning dogs gives in some cases
                        unfavourable results, it has been decided to charge several members of the
                        police force with the duty of shooting all pariah dogs in the city. This new
                        rule will come into force as from the beginning of next week.</p>

                        were the members of the committee for the reception of the Fleet: Mr. and

                        perfectly thundering and over-whelming. Mr. Nicolas Sinadino, the composer
                        of the piece, was repeatedly and enthusiastic. ally called for, and from a

                        the pieces executed were of a patriotie character, in connection with the
                        Greek nation, army and fleet, and it must be remarked that the observer
                        could not but be touched and impressed by the intense and sincere spirit of

                    <head>RABIES AMONG DOGS.<lb/>IMPORTANT NOTICE.</head>
                    <p>The Municipality consider it very necessary to draw the attention of the
                        public to the fact that Rabies among Dogs is at the present moment greatly
                        on the increase. No less than four persons have died from rabies in the year
                        1904, and of these two in the last month.</p>
                    <p>As the Vete inary Service was not advised by these persons when they were
                        bitten, the dogs were allowed to remain at large. </p>
                    <p>Again, no less than 17 persons have been bitten to the knowledge of the
                        Municipality in the last 2 months.</p>
                    <p>It is most essential that anyone bitten by a dog, cat, horse, or any other
                        animal should at once advise the Veterinary Service of the Municipality
                        (Telephone 1150) so that the animal can be caught and the necessary
                        precautions taken.</p>
                    <p>It should be well understood that this should be done even though the animal
                        may appear to be in perfect health-for it is only by examination that it can
                        be ascertained if the animal is suffering from rabies.</p>
                    <p>The Municipality are determined to do their utmost to remove this scourge-
                        but they are almost powerless unless assisted by the public.</p>

                        scored from a penalty. The school almost monopolised the play in the second
                        half and scored a magnificent goal through Mr. Hickling. Two more goals were
                        disallowed for various reasons. "Jumping" by one of the school "halves" was

                        Commission Manicipale. Le public, en effet, a sur les affaires de la ville
                        un droit de controle incontestable, ainsi que Lord Cromer lui-même le
                        reconnait dans son dernier rapport. Or, comment le public exercera-t-il ce
                        controle, sinon par la voie de la presse, et comment celle-ci à son tour
                        pourra-t-elle renseigner exactement l'opinion si elle n'est pas admise aux
                        séances ? On sait, et nous en avons souvent donné la preuve, que tous les
                        comptes-rendu officiels sont tronqués et dénaturés. D'autre part, la
                        Commission Municipale, qui a évidemment de bonnes raisons pour cela, refuse
                        impitoyablement d'admettre les journalistes dans ses réunions. La question
                        en est là. Nous voyons avec plaisir que la récente interpellation de M.
                        Alderson a eu pour résultat d'attirer l'attention de quelques-uns de nos
                        confrères. Nous résumons un article du Messagiere Egiziano que nous
                        voudrions pouvoir reproduire en entier.</p>
                    <p>" Pour la quatrième fois les conseillers municipaux viennent d'opposer un
                        veto irrévocable à l'admission de la presse à leurs séances. Toutes les
                        réclamations du publie, faites depuis tantot cinq ans, ont ainsi été
                        repoussées par une majorité moutonnière sous le prétexte que "le règlement
                        intérieur de la municipalité s'oppose à cette admission ". </p>
                    <p>" Rien pourtant dans ce reglement ne justifie une telle assertion. Le seul
                        article qui en parle dit "qu'on pourra communiquer à la presse des
                        comptes-rendus relatant les decisions prises par la Commission Municipale".
                        Voilà sur quoi se base le conseil municipal pour motiver son refus. Nous
                        pensons, au contraire, que l'article en question autorise le conseil sans
                        aucune restriction à rendre compte de son mandat par le moyen de la presse.
                        S'il en était autrement, il faudrait admettre que l'administration
                        municipale est un établissement privé et que ceux qui la dirigent ont le
                        droit de gaspiller à leur gré les deniers publics. Supposons un moment que
                        le règlement ne soit pas explicite, c'était le devoir dans ce cas du conseil
                        municipal de s'en référer à l'autorité compétente, qui est le ministère de
                        l'Intérieur. Mais non ! Il se prononce en dernier ressort. C'est donc qu'il
                        a peur de la décision du ministère, peur de la presse; et s'il a peur de la
                        presse, c'est donc que tout n'est pas en règle dans sa gestion ?"</p>
                    <p>On lit, d'autre part, dans l'Egypte:-</p>
                    <p>"La Commission municipale d'Alexandrie a rejeté la proposition de M. G.
                        Alderson tendant à admettre les journalistes à ses séances.</p>
                    <p>"Cette décision est absolument conforme à l'intérêt de la plupart des membres
                        de la municipalité; que deviendrait-elle s'il n'était pas possible de
                        corriger le procès verbal et de ne plus pouvoir lui faire dire seulement ce
                        qu'on veut qu'il dise ?</p>
                    <p>"Enfin nous nous réjouissons de cette décision pour une autre raison :
                        pourquoi voulez-vous que l'on oblige les rédacteurs de journaux à assister
                        aux réunions du palais municipal; pour qu'ils apprennent la corruption, le
                        favoritisme, le désordre et l'incapacité ? Et le tout n'est même pas
                        excusable par un peu de talent ou d'éloquence! Qu'on laisse donc la
                        Municipalité se suicider toute seule.</p>
                    <p>"En attendant il serait de bonne guerre de supprimer complètement la
                        publication dans les journaux, à quelque titre que ce soit, des noms de ceux
                        qui sont si jaloux de conserver le secret des délibérations municipales.</p>
                    <p>"Il n'y a qu'à publier les noms des votants et des lors mot d'ordre général :
                        plus de réclames. Nous ne sommes pas dignes d'assister à vos reunions, vous
                        n'existez plus pour nous.</p>
                    <p>"Qui sera bien attrapé ?"</p>
                    <p>L'attitude de la Commission Municipale vis-à-vis de la presse n'est pas
                        équivoque. Elle s'explique par le danger d'un tel voisinsge. Mais si nos
                        conseillers ont un intérêt évident à ne laisser connaître au public de leurs
                        délibérations que ce qu'ils veulent bien lui en communiquer, le public de
                        son côté a un intérêt tout aussi évident à connaître les dessous de
                        l'administration. Il a le droit pour lui; il a de plus l'assurance que le
                        Gouvernement appuiera ses legitimes revendications. Ces données une fois
                        posees, n'y aurait-il pas moyen pour la presse d'arriver à une entente. Des
                        comités se forment de tous cotés pour revendiquer des droits ; là ce sont
                        les locataires, ici les pharmaciens, les employés etc. Que la presse aussi
                        s'érige en comité et fasse connaître ses desiderata. Elle est d'ores et deja
                        assurée du concours de la population, puisque ce sont les intérêts de
                        celle-ci qu'elle défend ; elle est assurée du concours du Gouvernement,
                        puisque celui-ci a reconnu au public alexandrin le droit de contrôler la
                        gestion des affaires municipales et que le seul moyen d'y parvenir est
                        l'admission de la presse aux séances. </p>
                    <p>Si la Municipalite doit s'ecrouler sous l'action de la presse, c'est que
                        l'état de la malade est trop avancé pour supporter le remêde. Dans ce cas
                        meme la presse aura fait œuvre utile en débarraseant un peu plus tôt la
                        ville d'un corps dangereux.</p>

                        Moudir, who told defendant to pay the men. Afterwards the defendant's
                        interpreter took their pay-sheets. After leaving the Moudirieh defendant
                        went to the hotel. He did not pay them anything that day. The next day he
                        saw defendant outside and near the hotel. They applied to him for the money
                        but he did not answer. He was riding a donkey. Witness saw him mount the
                        donkey. Witness and com- panions asked defendant to pay half the amount due
                        to them. The defendant did not answer nor did he pay them. The next thing
                        that happened was that defendant fired at witness. Witness had no stick with
                        him. The first shot hit witness in the left shoulder. Defendant next fired
                        into the air. Witness heard only three shots fired. One of the shots hit a
                        donkey. The colour of the donkey was "blue." Nobody was riding the donkey.
                        The Wekil of the Moudirieh then appeared on the scene. At this time one
                        other English - man was with defendant. He was by his side. The police then
                        came up. The position of witness when shot was two or three yards from the
                        donkey, but was not holding it. They then all went to the Moudirieh. Witness
                        spent the next month in hospital, where he was a patient for thirty days.
                        This was in consequence of the wound.</p>
                    <p>By Mr. Gottlieb :- Witness is a Sudanese He recognised Mr. Sleeman in Court
                        as the gentleman who made arrangements with him on entering on his
                        engagement. Defendant was to give them food-one rubah of flour, lentils, a
                        little butter, onions and rice. Defendant paid all their expenses from
                        Assouan to Allaghi, which was P.T. 14. From Assouan to Allaghi defendant did
                        not give them money for food. From Allaghi to Himar he provided them with
                        camels at P.T. 5 per camel. When they got to the mine about 100 men were at
                        work there. Witness declared solemnly that he left his work because the food
                        ran out. Provisions were given out once a week, on Wednesday at sunset. The
                        provisions then given out were to last for the whole week. Witness could not
                        remember the day of the week he struck work. On the Sunday before he left
                        the defendant did not call him to tell him flour was getting short. There
                        was only one headman in the camp. The defendant did not call the headman and
                        witness and explain that the flour was running short.</p>
                    <p>This question was repeated to witness but he persisted in stating that
                        defendant did not call them and make above explanation. The defendant only
                        hronght 14;l- yvae w uowuuau and complained that he conld not live on
                        lentils and rice. At that time he carried no nabout. Witness did remember
                        Gohar Hassan giving evidence in the Cairo Consular Court.</p>
                    <p>A discussion ensued at this point as to whether the depositions of Gohar
                        Hassan before the Cairo Consular Court should be put in for the purpose of
                        contradicting witness on the point under discussion, Gohar Hassan not heing
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Cross-examination by Mr. Gottlieb continued : Witness refused to work becanse
                        he was hungry. There was no flour. He eat the lentils and rice. There was no
                        dhurra. Defendant did not give them extra lentils and rice as a compensation
                        for the flour falling short. They got the same measure of lentils and rice,
                        when there was ample flour and when the flour went short. If defendant
                        swears he did give them extra lentils and rice, he is telling a falsehood.
                        At the time he refused work and went away he did not have three days' supply
                        of flour in his possession. He had no flour at all. Sudanese always eat
                        flout . in their native country. They do not eat only dhurra. Defendant
                        treated him kindly at the mines and gave him backsheesh. If tbey worked
                        well, they got an extra day's pay. There were prizes for good work and
                        witness was one of those who gained a prize of P.T. 10. When he left the
                        mine after the <cb n="2"/> strike defendant did not supply them with camels
                        for Alleghi. When they got to Assouan, fifteen days before they saw
                        defendant, they did not go to the Bank of Egypt for their money. They made
                        no complaint to the Moudirieh before defendant arrived at Assouan. On the
                        20th July, the day before the shooting took place, at 8 a.m., witness and
                        his three friends were waiting for defendant at the hotel. He did not know
                        then that defendant wanted to catch the train for Cairo. He did not notice
                        any luggage. The defendant was going towards the station on the donkey. They
                        asked him for the money due to them. The defendant struck Gohar with his
                        hand outside the hotel. Witness saw this. On that morning witness did not
                        seize the donkey's bridle. Gohar's evidence that one ot them did seize hold
                        of the bridle is not true. In witness's own evidence at the police court he
                        declares he did seize hold of the bridle. Witness was here cautioned by the
                        Judge to be very careful as to the truth. He was then confronted with the
                        donkey boy and declared he did not know him. There were only four of them.
                        They did not stop him going to the station, they only asked him for half of
                        the money due. The defendant remained at the hotel and afterwards went to
                        the Moudirieh to complain of their conduct. Witness and another, Rislan
                        Said, went to the Moudirieh. They alone went. When the Sub-Moudir told some
                        of them to go down- stairs, he referred to Rislan Said and witness.</p>
                    <p>Counsel read an extract from witness's deposi- tion, taken at Cairo, where he
                        declared there were fourteen of them who were at the Moudirieh. Witness
                        declared there were only two. The fourteen others were downstairs at the
                        Moudirieh. They were also complaining about their wages. They had not been
                        waiting at the hotel. These others joined them (witness and Rislan Said) at
                        the Moudirieh. They had not previously been at the hotel. They were
                        originally fourteen. Ten of them went away after defendant had made
                        complaints at the Moudirieh. The two persons who gave evidence, Rislan Said
                        and witness, went to the Moudirieh. Ten of the men were dismissed as the
                        Acting-Moudir said they had no claim to wages. They did not then begin to
                        shout and howl. They walked away quietly. There was no "scene" of any kind
                        when the Acting Moudir dismissed these men. This investigation at the
                        Moudirieh took place at 8 a.m. Witness only went once on that day to the
                        Moudirieh. . He made no more complaints on that day to the Moudirieh. He did
                        not see his friends com- plaining. They sat down by the lebbek tree in front
                        of the hotel. The other ten men were not there. Witness waited from 8 a.m.
                        to 8 p.m. under the lebbek tree with Rislan Said and the other two men. On
                        the day of the shooting these four men went early to the hotel. They did not
                        see the baggage of the defendant going to the station. Witness did not see
                        defendant go to the station that morning. At 8 a.m. witness and his friends
                        carried no sticks.</p>
                    <p>Counsel then read from Gohar Hassan's depositions. Therein that man stated
                        that they went first at 8 a.m. to the railway station. They went for their
                        wages. (Witness contra- dicted this) "I had a stick, but a donkey boy took
                        it from me." This statement or Gohar, as well as his statement that Rislan
                        had a stick, was put to witness, who declared he did not see them.</p>
                    <p>In the Sudan nobody walks with a stick. T :.... L_1 narer soon a Endanoso
                        with a stick. He had never seen a Sudanese carrying an axe. The statement of
                        witness's friends should be contradicted. When defendant came out of the
                        hotel, prior to the shooting, there were four persons. He did not catch hold
                        of the donkey's bridle. Gohar Hassan's statement that the bridle was seized
                        is not true. Rislan Said's statement that witness laid hold of the bridle is
                        not true.</p>
                    <p>Witness laid hold of the bridle after he was shot. The statement of the
                        donkey boy that witness laid hold of the donkey and demanded his wages is
                        not true. Witness was not holding the bridle when shot, he only seized it
                        after he was shot. Nobody was holding the bridle. Witness could not explain
                        why defendant did not ride on if nobody obstructed the donkey. Gohar Hassan
                        declared (from the depositions)that defendant aimed behind him when he shot
                        the donkey as he wanted to shoot Ahmed because he wanted his wages. Witness
                        declares he did not see Ahmed. Witness had no nabout in his hand. He did not
                        see defendant drawing his revolver. He only telt the shot. In reply to a
                        repetition of the questionasto whether witness had a nabout raised
                        threateningly at defendant's head while holding the bridle with his left
                        hand, witness denied this absolutely. It defendant declares so, he is a
                        liar, and if his companion, Mr. Halliday, says so, he is a liar. Witness was
                        hit by the first shot. Witness, according to Counsel's depositions,<cb n="3"
                        /> declared that he saw revolver being taken from the defendant's beit and
                        he also mentioned that he saw the case. Witness persisted in saying that he
                        only felt the shot and saw nothing of he kind. When questioned by Counsel at
                        Cairo why, if he saw the revolver, he did not run away, he declared that he
                        would not give up his rights by running away. Witness remembered this
                        question being put to him. He did not run away, but he expected to get his
                        rightsin. accordance with custom and rule. After he was shot, witness did
                        nothing whatever. He did not seize the accused. He laid hold of the donkey.
                        Defendant seized hold of witness by the neck and threw him down. He could
                        not allow the donkey to proceed, as he had been shot. When the police came,
                        defendant was over witness and laying hold of witness. Witness, after being
                        shot, seized the donkey, laid hold of defendant and threw him down.
                        Defendant dismounted from the donkey by himself. Immediately before the shot
                        was fired, the other three were about eight yards off. The bullet is still
                        unextracted. Witness was carried to the hospital by his friends.</p>
                    <p>Re-examined by Mr. Briscoe :-</p>
                    <p>Witness knew the distinction between the terms "lie" and "mistake." Gohar's
                        assertions were "lies."</p>
                    <p>At this stage the hearing of the case was adjourned until 2.30 p.m.</p>
                    <p>Rislan Said was the next witness called. Examined by Mr. Briscoe :- He left
                        the company's employment because he was not satistied with the food, as he
                        did not care for a diet of rice and lentils without flour. One month's
                        wages, about P.T. 150, were due to him at that time. In about fifteen days
                        he heard that the defendant was at Assouan and he went to see him on the day
                        before Gomar was shot in order to get his money. They came outside of the
                        hotel but did not see him. On the next day they saw defendant and showed him
                        their wage-sheets, but he did not pay them. These four went to the
                        Moudirieh, and there was also a number of other dis- satisfied employés of
                        the company, who went to the Moudirieh. The Sub-Moudir saw two of them.
                        These were Gomar Said and the witness. The majority did not send a repre-
                        sentative to the Sub-Moudir. The Sub-Moudir told Mr. Sleeman that he must
                        pay witness and his three companions. Witness and Gomar then withdrew,
                        expecting to be paid, and they stopped outside the hotel. On the following
                        day they did not apply for payment as they expected payment would be made.
                        On the next day they sent word to Mr. Sleeman at the hotel, telling him they
                        were waiting outside the hotel and wanting their money. They were told to
                        wait. At 9 a.m. Mr. Slee- man came out and wanted to ride off to the
                        station. Witness and the others were then from 20 to 25 yards from the
                        hotel. They all asked for their money. While so doing, and the train was on
                        the point of leaving, Mr.Sleeman drew his revolver. They were grouped
                        together and were drawing near to the defendant, when he fired at Gomar. It
                        was Gomar, who laid hold of the donkey and told defendant he must stop until
                        the money was paid. Witness saw Gomar bleeding from the shoulder after the
                        first shot had been fired. After the firing the police came up. Witness
                        heard three shots fired. They were arrested and taken to the Markaz. Witness
                        had nothing in his hand at the time and neither Gomar nor he carried sticks.
                        There was another Englishman with defendant.</p>
                    <p>Examined, by Mr. Gottlieb :- Witness had been well-treated at the mine and
                        had received backsheesh. He had no flour in his possession when he left. On
                        seeing the defendant at Assouan they spoke to him and he lost the train
                        owing to their detaining him. On the first day, the 20th July, none of them
                        had nabouts. Sudanese do not carry nabouts. Witness had never seen a
                        Sudanese earry a nabout. There were only wituess and his three companions
                        present, the other ten dissa- tisfied employes were not there. Mr. Sleeman
                        and witness and his three friends adjourned to the Moudirieh. They were at
                        the Moudirieh when the other ten men came. They left the Moudirieh together
                        under the impression that they were all to be made. They did not return to
                        the Moudirieh on that day after the Acting-Moudir had spoken to them. On the
                        day of the shooting witness had no stick in his hand, as he does not carry a
                        stick. Counsel proceeded to read from Gohar Hassan's depositions, who stated
                        that they had gone to the station. He had no stick but Rislan had. Witness
                        denied this. On that morning he only once saw Mr. Sleeman try to get to the
                        station. On the second day only witness and his companion were by the hotel.
                        The ten other men did not turn up as their claimns had been dismissed and
                        never put in an appearance on the second day. Witness did not see de fendant
                        draw his revolver, but he saw hin point his revolver. Mr. Sleeman seized
                        Gomar by the throat after shooting him and the police came up. Witness had
                        no knowledge of Gohar Hassan's whereabouts. He never saw Gomar raise a stick
                        to strike defendant just before the shooting began. </p>
                    <p>By the Judge :- On the first day the defendant and another Englishman with
                        the donkey boys behind came from the hotel and they all made an appeal for
                        their money. Defendant missed the train because they were talking to him. On
                        the second day they all four stopped in front of him and so he could not get
                        to the station. He was engaged in speaking with them while they were
                        standing in front. The conversation was not long, as the defendant began to
                        shoot. He then laid hold of Gomar, after shooting him, and came off the
                        donkey.</p>
                    <p>Admed Said was then called.</p>
                    <p>Examined by Mr. Briscoe :He is a labourer of Assouan, and went there after
                        leaving the mine. The defendant owed him money. On the morning of the
                        shooting Gomar went to the defendant and asked for the money due to him, <cb

                        due to him, the latter drew his pistol and shot him. He heard three shots
                        fired, and Gomar was shot by the first shot.</p>
                    <p>Examined by Mr. Gottlieb :- A month's wages were due to him. Ile did not
                        leave before the month was up. He is a Sudanese. On the first day when the
                        defendant left the hotel and wanted to go to the sta- tion, Gomar accosted
                        him and asked for the money. He did not hear what Go- mah said as witness
                        and the two others were at some distance from Gomar. The other dissatisfied
                        men were not there. Witness did not know whether detendant wanted to go to
                        Cairo, but he knew on that morning that he desired to leave Assouan by
                        train. They never surrounded detendant or hindered him. While they were
                        asking for their money the train left. They had no sticks with them at the
                        time. When they were told at the Moudirieh, that they were to be paid, they
                        did not return on that day to the Moudirieh. Some of the de- positions made
                        by witness at Cairo were then read out but he denied he had said as stated
                        therein. As to the fact that Gomar laid hold of detendant's bridle on the
                        day of the shoot- ing, he denied this. None of them had nabouts, nor did
                        Gomar raise a nabout threateningly to the defendant prior to the shooting. .
                        Only three shots were fired. Witness denied the statement he made at Cairo
                        that four shots were fired. One shot was fired at Gomar, the second shot hit
                        a donkey in the street, the third shot's destination was unknown to the
                        witness.</p>
                    <p>Gohar Hassan would have now been called, but he had disappeared. His
                        depositions were then read out by the Judge.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Aly Ibrahim, of the Sanitary Adminis- tration, was next called. He
                        attended Gomar at Assouan Hospital, as he was suffering from a bullet shot.
                        He described in English the nature of the wound. It might have been
                        dangerous, as it went very near the top of the lung. The bullet had not been
                        extracted, as there was no X-ray apparatus at Assouan. The wound showed that
                        the revolver had been fired at close range.</p>
                    <p>The Sub-Moudir of Ghirgeh was then called.</p>
                    <p>Examined by Mr. Briscoe: On July 20th he was Acting Moudir at Assouan. He
                        informed Mr. Sleeman, when there were differences between him and the
                        workmen, that it was a civil matter, but that to oblige him he would look
                        into it and give a decision. He called before him 12 workmen with the
                        defendant. Of these 8 were dismissed, as he considered their claims
                        baseless. They were satisfied and went away quietly. In regard to the claims
                        of the other four, he told Mr. Sleeman that their claims were just and that
                        he had better pay them. Mr. Sleeman acceded and he informed him that he was
                        going to pay them. He went to the courtyard of the Moudirieh and told the 8
                        men that they could have no money, while he informed the other men that they
                        had a right to their money. This was at 10 a.m. on the 20th July, and Mr.
                        Sleeman left, followed by the four men. At 9 p.m. on the same day an Arab
                        came to witness's house, bringing a letter written in English from Mr. Slee-
                        man. It contained some money. He did not open it as it was written in
                        English and he sent the letter back, but he never saw the letter again. He
                        told the Arab who had brought it that he could not settle the business in
                        his official capacity as it did not come within the province of his official
                        duties.</p>
                    <p>In this letter Mr. Sleeman said that he con- sidered the action so serious
                        that he would wire to the Ministry of the Interior. He said that to prevent
                        a repetition of the "dis- graceful scenes" of that morning he would require
                        the assistance of the police or would else have to take other measures, as
                        it would have a serious resulting effect on labour at the mine. Next morning
                        he went an hour earlier to his office as he expected a visit from Mr.
                        Sleeman and the men. The men came and told him that they had waited all the
                        previous day, but had received no payment. The Acting Moudir told them to
                        wait in the courtyard and wait 20 minutes or so for Mr. Sleeman. As Mr.
                        Sleeman did not come, the men went to the hotel, which is about 100 metres
                        off. The next development of the situation, which came to the notice of the
                        Acting Moudir, was that he heard the report of firearms. As the Mamour
                        el-Markaz was with him at the time, he told him to go to see what was the
                        matter. He also went to the spot, having heard 3 or 4 shots fired. When he
                        came ont he saw that Mr. Sleeman had been arrested and was in charge of 2 or
                        3 policemen. There was a crowd of natives. As it was the sitings of the
                        local Criminal Court there were many people about. When the Sudanese were
                        searched no sticks or weapons were found upon them. He wired particulars to
                        Mr. Alban and he replied asking him to send all the persons and papers con-
                        nected with the affair to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Examined by Mr. Gottlieb :- When Mr. Sleeman came to the Moudirieh on the
                        20th July he came to make a complaint against the Sudanese. He complained
                        that the Sudanese were making unjustifiable claims for money. Mr. Sleeman
                        did not complain that the Suda- nese had interfered with him in the street.
                        Mr. Sleeman spoke in English. Witness does not understand English, but he
                        had an interpreter. <cb n="5"/>He understood that the Sudanese were bother-
                        ing Mr. Sleeman about the money. The Suda- nese told witness that they were
                        discontented about the tood which the company had agreed to supply them
                        with. His first decision was that Mr. Sleeman was to pay the four men their
                        money less P.T. 50 torfeit. He did not say that this was to refer to three
                        of the four while Gomar was to get nothing. Mr. Sleeman did not then say
                        that he was not complaimiug about a question of money, but that he complamed
                        about being mutertered with by the men and that it was a question of
                        principle involved. At least, the witness's interpreter said nothing about
                        this. Witness was here contronted with his state- ment as taken down by Mr.
                        Alban, and he said he would swear that it was due to an error ot the
                        interpreter. When Mr. Sleeman left the Moudirieh the final decision was that
                        he was to pay the four men in tull, but the others were to receive
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sleeman during the interview on the 20th July did ask tor police
                        protection trom witness, if the men did not accept the decision. As the
                        decision had been accepted and both parties appeared to be reconciled,
                        witness did not thiuk such protection any longer necessary. There were no
                        ponice in trout of the hotel be- tore detendant tired, but there were no
                        less thau four policeman about 50 metres off at the Parquet. Ii Mr. Sleeman
                        had looked up or down the street he would have seen police within reasonable
                        distance. Sudanese carry nabouts much about the same way as other people
                        do.</p>
                    <p>Re-examined by Mr. Briscoe :- The decision witness gave was intended to be
                        definite.</p>
