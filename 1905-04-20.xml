                        named Kiroa Nicholas on Docember 20, 1904. This is tho fourth execution that
                        has taken place in four successive days. </p>

                        made an issue of 25,000 preference shares, >e note that tho formation of a
                        company to manufacture the materials necessary for their business, in Egypt,
                        where the company has carried out important works, has been decided upon by
                        the directors. From a report made to the board by the managing director
                        relative to the negotiations and interviews which he has conducted in Egypt,
                        the directors believe that the whole of the requisite working capital for
                        such a company can be found locally in Egypt by gentlemen who are well
                        acquainted with the merits of the compony's materials and whose connection
                        with the company here should prove invaluable. Under the contemplated
                        arrangements the company will be entitled to one-half of the profits of the
                        Egyptian company, the basis of such arrangements being that it is to receive
                        an amount in fully-paid shares of such company equivalent to the cash
                        capital Messrs. G. M. Callender &amp; Co., Limited, are the sole suppliers

                    <head>DISPUTE OVER EGYPTIAN MINING CONCESSIONS. </head>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich, in the Chancery Division last week, had before him the
                        matter of Brown v. Haig and Oxley, arising out of a pending action by Mr.
                        Archibald Knox Brown, a mining engineer, against the defendants with regard
                        to a disputed partnership in some mining concessions in Egypt and the Sudan.
                        Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K.C., for Mr. Haig, said the application against the
                        plaintiff was that he should be ordered to give security for costs in a
                        pending action, and he would also submit that the notice of trial was
                        irregular. After hearing Mr. Terrell for the plaintiff, his lordship ordered
                        the plaintiff to give security for £100 to each of the defendants. As to the
                        notice of trial his lordship found that the rules had not been observed, and
                        he therefore set aside the notice of trial on this, plaintiff's counsel at
                        once gave fresh notice of trial </p>

                    <p>While in matters financial the same conditions on the Stock Markets have
                        ruled as were ruling last week the issue of the South African Trust, and the
                        most recent Egyptian companies have thrown extraordinary light upon the
                        amount of capital ready for investment The applications in England and
                        France for that company are stated to have amounted to £20,000,000, showing
                        there are still in these two countries investors with sufficient confidence
                        in the future of "Kaffirs" to put in as much again as has been invested up
                        to the present This, taken in conjunction with what we call attention to
                        below, would seem unmistakably to point to ranch enlarged markets in the
                        future, and considerably higher prices for investments, even in the mining
                        class The future of cheap money seeming to be assured, it would look as if a
                        return to these conditions most lead to an altogether higher level of
                        prices, especially when considered in conjunction with the Government plans
                        of not making any further issue of Consols this year. As soon as the new
                        issue of £10,000.000 Exchequer Bonds, which has been greatly sought after,
                        is out of the way, a considerable rise in Consols would appear to be
                        inevitable if the political barometer is undisturbed. There is much leeway
                        yet to be made up by first-class investment securities, and as soon as these
                        have appreciated, the demand for more speculative stocks is sore to follow.
                        The accounts of the Easter holidays will no doubt delay events for a short
                        time. </p>
                    <p>Quite the feature of the past week, in spite of the fact that the Egyptian
                        market has been dull and quiet, has been the phenomenal securities that has
                        attended the flotation of the Egyptian Trust and Investment, Ltd. Although
                        the promoters were only asking for £200,000, the following figures, we are
                        informed, represent the amounts applied for :— In London—£1,012,037 In
                        Egypt— £9,759,429 or a grand total of £10,771,466. In other words, over
                        £1,000,000 was put down in application money alone. The number of applicants
                        exceeded 5,000,. The allotment of the shares will be made to-day. It will
                        take place simultaneously in London and Egypt and each distribution is
                        independent of the other. The price of the shares is nominally 5/8 premium,
                        although we doubt if they could be bought even at 3/4 premium. We understand
                        the rush for the prospectus was so great that, although the London Bank
                        applied for more copies a day or two before the issue was made, the company
                        were unable to famish them Cut enough, to-keep pace with the demand. The
                        Egyptian market, with the exception of the mining section, which is weak,
                        keeps fairly firm. Dairas hold their price well at 27 1/8, and both National
                        and Agricultural Banks keep strong, though both these prices really look
                        quite high enough at 27 1/8 and 13 3/8. Egyptian Markets have come in for
                        some attention this week, and have hardened to 1 3/8, and look good for a
                        further improvement The issue of shares at 2 has not affected the price of
                        Delta Lands. </p>
                    <p>The remarkable success of the last new issue, the Egyptian Trust and
                        Investment, Ltd., has been referred to above. The Egyptian Laid and General
                        Trusty issued two days previously, iras also largely oversubscribed, and the
                        shares stand at 1/2premium. This company. is in good hands as far as the
                        market is concentrated, and should do well. </p>
                    <p>In the mining section the North Nile Company's report was a weak point, and
                        upset what was already a dull market, so that prices have given way
                        considerably. Fresh capital requirements are spoken of in several cases.
                        What business there is is of a very professional nature. </p>

                    <p>At yesterday's sitting of the Court of Appeal, presided over by M. de Konmu,
                        several interesting cases were heard. One concerned the question as to
                        whether, in consequence of the decree of November, 1904 (following the
                        Anglo-French Agreement), the Egyptian State, Railways, in relation to
                        treaties, were still under the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals. The
                        point was a purely legal one, and the arguments were ably put forward by
                        Counsel for the appellants, and Sciarahati Bey for the Government. A claim
                        for damages amounting to £7,500 against the International Sleeping Car
                        Company was disposed of. A waiter in the service of the company was injured
                        in accident which occurred in 1903. The patient was doing well under the
                        treatment of the company's doctors, Dr. Madden and Dr. Phillips, but he
                        developed "railway spine" after the unusual period of nine months after
                        abandoning the company's doctors. The Cairo Tribunal granted him £1,400
                        instead of £600 which the company offered as equivalent to his net salary of
                        £4 a month for his lifetime. Both parties appealed. The claimant set forward
                        his points through Me. Volpini, replacing Me. Ballis of Cairo. Me. Carton de
                        Wiart appeared for the company and forcibly put forward its position,
                        maintaining the offer in spite of the curious circumstances of the case.
                        There was also an action for the illegitimate use of tobacco packing cases,
                        in which Me. Manusardianly defended the Salomon Cigarette Company, whilst
                        Me. Carton de Wiart strongly advocated the appeal of Messrs. Sabi Bros., the
                        Cairo merchants. The case of Boustros Bros. v. the Alexandria Stockbrokers'
