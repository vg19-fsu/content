                    <head>A WORD OF WARNING.</head>
                    <p>Our columns contained on Saturday last two articles side by side, between
                        which at first sight there is little connection, but which, nevertheless,
                        bear one upon the other in u way that does not appear on the surface. One

                        steps taken to ensure that in the future there shall be no trouble in
                        consequence of the overlooking of due precautions in the initial stages of
                        development of the gold i mines. In the article to which we refer, and which
                        appeared in the "Financier," we find the following :— </p>
                    <p>"There is ono point which should not be overlooked just as Egyptians are
                        entering upon a phase of activity that will last just as long as the market
                        is maintained in a healthy condition, and that is the question of labour.
                        This not a burning question, nor happily can it ever be made a party
                        question, as in the case of the Rand. But in these vast areas of the Upper
                        Nile the population is exceedingly sparse, and consequently labourers are
                        few. In the near future labour will have to be imported, hut this can he
                        done easily from India, the coolies there finding congenial surroundings in
                        the valley of the Nile. The point does not arise immediately because the
                        mines are only in the development stage, but it will later, and it is as
                        well to realise the fact now instead of ever allowing it to become a market
                        factor, and ultimately a paralysing mining one." We will put this into other
                        words, and see how well it fits in with the extract from the other article,
                        which runs as follows "Our prosperity is as true as the sunshine, without
                        clouds of rain ; many millions are waiting to be used. This is the testing
                        point in the history of Egypt It wants the iron hand in the velvet glove to
                        keep down the incoming stream of h peculate re, some honest bringing
                        progress and advancement, some driven by that hell-fire, the gamblers'
                        instinct, and the last dishonest, ready to sacrifice anybody and anything to
                        get hold of the alluring millions." </p>
                    <p>The meaning of this is dear and precise. Let ns proceed to read into it the
                        true significance of the other, bearing in mind what had been said before in
                        the same article:—Never mind the cold douche which Lord Cromer once
                        administered and which bid fair to give Egyptian mining it quietus ; in
                        Egypt and the Sudan lies enormous wealth in the way of ancient gold mines
                        and newlydiscovered gold areas, to which the wealth of the Rand is as
                        nothing. Get your foothold there. Never mind the Egyptian nation to whom the
                        wealth rightly belongs. Secure the land, and secure the right to import
                        cheap foreign labour, so that foreign capital may have for its working
                        machinery a class of labour that will not have any interest other than those
                        of the people who employ them. We might add a good deal more that may notbe
                        implied by the writer, but would most certainly result, from the importation
                        of Indian coolies into Egypt and the Sudan, it behoves the authorities to
                        use the utmost vigilance in this matter so as to make it impossible for any
                        future British Agent to sanction such a proceeding. Prevention is better
                        than cure, and forewarned is forearmed. One of the most experienced mining
                        engineers of the day to whom we referred the question—we mean Mr. Alford
                        —told ns that the proposal to employ coolie labour was a perfectly practical
                        ore, commercially speaking, whatever it might be politically. We think it
                        oar duty to make the most emphatic protest in our power against the proposal
                        being even considered possible to be entertained, either now, five, ten, or
                        twenty years hence, or during the existence of any lease or concession that
                        may be granted. We have not the slightest wish to discourage the development
                        of the mining industry in Egypt, on the contrary we foresee a great future
                        for it. If, as seems possible, land development may undergo somewhat of a
                        check through the Assouan dam decision, it may well be that capitalists will
                        turn their attention to the mineral wealth of the country, and there is
                        something very fascinating in the thought of the old workings being
                        reopened, and the almost fabulous wealth of ancient times again obtained.
                        But our desire is to see this wealth distributed. over as large an area as
                        possible and to prevent its going into the hands of the men who are...
                        "dishonest, ready to sacrifice anybody and anything to get hold of the
                        alluring millions." Lord Cromer possesses the iron hand in the velvet glove,
                        and, ail the "Finaucier" writer admits, has used it in the past with effect.
                        His work in Egypt is not as yet within measurable distance of being
                        accomplished, and the phenomenal prosperity of the present times only places
                        fresh burdens on his shoulders, in place of those of which the smooth
                        currents of late years have in some measure relieved him. We would call upon
                        all to give him most hearty and generous support, and if in the true
                        interests of Egypt Lord Cromer has to make a firm stand against importunate
                        capitalists, eager for their own interests only, and careless of the
                        well-being of the people, as so many of these prove themselves, we trust
                        that it will never be a reproach to the British community resident in Egypt,
                        that at any critical moment that may come, they failed to give his lordship
                        the strong backing he has every right to expect from them. </p>

                    <head>THE EXPANSION OF CAIRO</head>
                    <p> The petition that has been sent in to the Government by the residents and
                        proprietors of Boulac-avenue will, it is to be hoped, meet with the
                        attention it deserves, for it is not only a fair statement of the interests
                        of the petitioners but also of those of the entire community. As we pointed
                        out some, little time ago when dealing with the ques- tion of house
                        accommodation in Cairo, one of the really pressing questions of the day is
                        the facilitating of the expansion that the city is now undergoing. More and
                        more every day the residents within what were formerly the limits of the
                        town are being pushed outwards from the centre to make way for the steadily
                        growing need of ampler accommodation for the purely commercial and business
                        demands on the available house and building space. The results of the
                        difficulties arising from the pre- sent condition of affairs are highly
                        injurious to all the best interests of the town and of the community, and
                        the one real, and indeed only, effective remedy that can be applied is the
                        opening up of the vacant spaces lying within a three or four-mile radius
                        from the centre of the city. That this may be done it is essential that the
                        Nile may be so bridged that it may cease to be the formidable barrier it now
                        is to the natural growth of the town. The existing bridge is situated in
                        perhaps the wont possible site that could be chosen for this purpose, and
                        that upon which work has already been commenced at, or rather just beyond,
                        Foum el Khalig, though it will meet a very important demand and will have a
                        very great effect upon the expansion of Ghizeh, will do but little for Cairo
                        itself except indirectly, by in some degree relieving the pressure upon its
                        residential accommodation. The bridge advocated by the petition to which we
                        have referred would, however, do infinitely more, and if accompanied by the
                        provision of a tramway service at this point, would unques- tionably do more
                        to meet existing difficulties than any other measure that can be proposed.

                    <p>As telegraphed already, the third squadron of the Baltic Fleet left here this
                        morning for Suez, with the exception of the hospital ship "Kostroma," which
                        entered the canal yesterday | afternoon at five o'clock, and which will
                        con-|| tinue to Djibouti without awaiting the main | portion of the
                        squadron, Every precaution has been taken to guard against any "regrettable
                        incidents" in Egyptian waters ; the banks of the canal are being strongly
                        guarded by special patrols of police and coastguardamen, and all other
                        traffic has been stopped. His | Britannic Majesty's Consul, Mr. Cameron, and
                        the Commandant of Police, Sohalck Bey, left| for Ismailia and Suez by the
                        midday train, whilst the Russian Consul-General, M. Maxi. moff, left by the
                        8.10 am. train. </p>
                    <p>The squadron has drawn a sum of £95,000 from the Credit Lyonnais for their
                        expenses, and of this more than 47,000 francs have been paid in canal dues. </p>
                    <p>The report is current that a second division of this squadron will set sail
                        early next month and that three torpedo boats are awaiting them at Suda, but
                        I cannot vouch for the truth of the rumour. </p>
                    <p>Much interest has been aroused by the telegram annouucing that a Russian
                        torpedo boat with a fleet behind it was sighted oft | Port Louis, but the
                        general opinion is that the said torpedo boat and fleet were not Russian but
                        Japanese. As far as we know, the Baltic Heet is nowhere near the Indian
                        Ocean, and we have every reason to believe that the </p>
                    <p>Japanese fleet is cruising in those waters, | whilst the Baltic Fleet is
                        generally supposed to be sailing towards Djibouti, where it will meet the
                        third squadron. It is therefore a matter for speculation whether we shall
                        see I the Russians pass back through the canal very shortly, or, if the
                        Japanese fleet is really giving chase, whether we shall hear of its total
                        extermination, for it is a very safe I prophecy to say that the fleets which
                        have I passed through the canal can make no stand agtúnst a Japanese fleet
                        which is in as good a condition now as at the beginning of the war. The
                        Japanese ships have all been recently overhauled and thorvuyhly repaired,
                        whilst those of the Russians are almost without ex| ception of ancient date,
                        are badly damaged by heavy weather in many instances, and are manned by
                        crews of uutrained and uneducated peasants. </p>

                        <p>The Court of Assiout has delivered three Death sentences since the
                            beginning of March.</p>
                        <p>The first was the case of a young man of about</p>
                        <p>22 years of age, who murdered his father in</p>
                        <p>order to inherit on and a half feddans of land</p>
                        <p>which the latter possessed.</p>
                        <p>The second was the case of a certain Awad</p>
                        <p>Said Bekbit of Awlad-cl-Sheik (Ghirgeh) who</p>
                        <p>murdered three persons in one minute. This man</p>
                        <p>intended to murder the emdeh of his village,</p>
                        <p>because the latter had accused him of crimes</p>
                        <p>the perpetrators of which were unknown.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, he went with his rifle to the house</p>
                        <p>of the omdeb, in the month of August 1903,</p>
                        <p>with the intention of shooting him. Arrived</p>
                        <p>there he fired but missed the omeh. The</p>
                        <p>shot, however, took effect on two men who</p>
                        <p>were sitting near by, killing them on the spot.</p>
                        <p>The criminal fired again at the omdeh and</p>
                        <p>a third man was killed by the second shot.</p>
                        <p>The prisoner confessed his crime and was </p>
                        <p>condemned to death.</p>
                        <p>The third case occurred at Mellawi Station.</p>
                        <p>Two months ago a certain Mustapha Abdul</p>
                        <p>Ghani was shot there, and on equiries being</p>
                        <p>Institied the murder confessed, and named</p>
                        <p>a merchant of the place as being his associate.</p>
                        <p>The latter was condemmed to death, as</p>
                        <p>it was proved that he had played the most important</p>
                        <p>part in the commission of the crime.</p>
                        <p>It is unual to have three judegments</p>
                        <p>of dead passed in three weeks in a single</p>
                        <p>court. But crime is increasing every day,</p>
                        <p>and it would occupy a great deal of space</p>
                        <p>daily to tell of the crime in Assiout alone.</p>
                        <p>There must be something wrong in the </p>
                        <p>machinery of the police; and that this is</p>
                        <p>the case will be proved in my next letter.</p>

                    <head>RUSSIA TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR of the "Egptian Gazette "</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The letter in your issue of yesterday is an excellent demonstration of
                        the truth of the old saying that certain folks rush in where angels fear to
                        tread.</p>
                    <p>If the writer of the article in question knew anything of the subject, even
                        to the extent of the little knowledge which is a dangerous tiling, he would
                        be aware that the position of the Russian Army to-day and that of the
                        Federals after the Battle of Rappahannock are as different as light is from
                        darkness.</p>
                    <p>The Federals were defeated, it is true, but they were near their bases, and
                        did not depend</p>
                    <p>For the supply of ammunitions and provisons on</p>
                    <p>the limited carrying power of about for thousands</p>
                    <p>miles of single line railway, with a disloyal personnel.</p>
                    <p>The writer has been directly concerned in a responsible way with the
                        commissariat of a force of 20,000 fighting men, at a distance of less than
                        1,000 miles from their base, and be knows how many anxious days and
                        sleepless nights were passed in order to keep the kettles boiling.</p>
                    <p>That Russian can raise another 500,000 men nobody doubts, but that she can
                        ever transport them to the seat of the war, or deed them even if they were
                        once there, is as impossible as to teach a horse to live on sawdust.</p>
                    <p>The reference to the Anglo-Boer War shows as much ignorance of military
                        matters as the remarks on Rappahannock.</p>
                    <p>True it is that the British were far from their base, by the seas was an open
                        highway, and we could send down any number of men we could recruit, and
                        limitless supplies of munitions and provisions.</p>
                    <p>Against us was an army of say 80,000 men, which included every fighting man
                        of the whole populations, and when that force was worn out, there was no
                        hope replacing it.</p>
                    <p>But with Japan it is otherwise. Her population is sufficient to enable her to
                        keep up her present armaments and her financial credit such that she need
                        fear no lack of the sinews of war.</p>
                    <p>The present position of affairs is a striking proof of the verity of the
                        verse of Cowper's hymn quoted by your correspondent.</p>
                    <p>Truly God moves in a mysterious way. His arm has struck down the ruthless
                        assassins of His people.</p>
                    <p>"Our God hath crushed the tyrant</p>
                    <p>Our God hath raised the slave;</p>
                    <p>Hath mocked the counsel of the wise,</p>
                    <p>The valour of the brave.</p>
                    <p>Then glory to His holy Name"</p>
                    <p>From whom all glories are,</p>
                    <p>And glory to the little Japs</p>
                    <p>Who chased the Russians far.</p>
                    <p>I trust he great historian will forgive me, if ghost can forgive, for the
                        termination I have to put to his lines.</p>
                    <p>At the risk of being considered naughty, I mist quote a verse on which name
                        into my head on reading the conclusion of Mr. Atwood's letter:</p>
                    <p>"He moves in a mysterious way To drive Oyama forth.</p>
                    <p>He never budges towards the south. But always towards the north.</p>

                    <head>HAVE YOU THESE SYMPTOMS?</head>
                    <p>Diseased Kidneys Cause Backache, Urinary Disorders, Gravel, Dizziness, Puffy
                        Flesh, Nervousness, and Irregular Heart's Action.</p>
                    <p>Kidney disease does not usually come on with sharp pain. If it did it would
                        not be so dangerous, because the patient would at once seek treatment and
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, most often it comes on quietly — may have been working in
                        the system for years before the patient suspected the real cause of his
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>There may have been backaches, limbaches, neuralgia, sciatica, rheumatism, a
                        nervous, irritable feeling, or a generally tired feeling, weak heart,
                        dropsy, etc.</p>
                    <p>He did not know these were symptoms of kidney disease, and so he doctored the
                        symp­toms, and not the kidneys.</p>
                    <p>Thus the trouble kept growing worse, until disturbances of the water
                        appeared, or there was gravel, or retention of the urine, or backaches — or
                        some such plain sign of kidney trouble that there could be no doubt.</p>
                    <p>Doan's backache kidney pills should be taken at the first sign of anything
                        wrong. There is no other safe way, because kidney complaints are the most
                        dangerous of all discuss, except consumption. Doan's pills are a great aid

                        perform properly that most important of all functions — the filtering of the

                        those impurities which the blood gathers up in its circuit of the body. In

                    <p>SPORT AT SUEZ </p>
                    <p>The E. T. 0. cricket ground at Suez has been prepared for the coming season,
                        and the X I is in very good form, ready to compete with any team from any
                        man-of-war that may wish to challenge them.The first hockey season at Suez
                        has been very successful Five matches hare been played by the E. T. C. team
                        against teams, one from H. M. S. "Hogue," one from H.M.S. "Barflour," and
                        three from the cable ship "Electra." Of these matches, the E. T. C. won four
                        and lost one. The winning team was from H. U. S. "Hogue." The football
                        season consisted of fifteen matches. One of the most sporting Association
                        teams at Suez consists of the pupils of the Government Schools, who are very
                        keen on the game and show any amount of pluck. They played the E.T.C. eleven
                        nine times, and secured four goals against seventy during the season with
                        indomitable perseverance. A large number of football matches were arranged
                        with the various cable ships calling at Suez, and there were also matching
                        against H.M.S "Hogue" and Port Said. The victory of the E.T.C eleven over
                        Port Said was more decisive, and they scored six goals to nil. Although the
                        Port Said eleven was picked team, selected from the best players of the
                        large English colony there, they were entirely defeated. We regret to say
                        one of the Port Said team is still in hospital. The Suez Golf Club is very
                        flourishing thanks to the energetic and genial secretary, Mr. Hoseason.
                        Owing to the organizing genius of this gentleman the club has been brought
                        up to the highest pitch of prosperity and numbers nearly half a hundred
                        members, including all the "cream' of the English society of Suez and Port
                        Tewfik. There links are amongst the best in Egypt, and many patrons of the
                        royal and Antient game aver that the Helouan links do not hold a candle of
                        those of Suez. Two golf competitions are held every month, one bogey and one
                        stroke, and substantial prizes are always competed for. The club
                        unfortunately is on the point of losing one of its most enterprising
                        members, Mr. George Owen. This prominent member of the English colony at
                        Suez is a thorough sportsman and is most popular. He is keen member of the
                        Golf Club committee and exerted himself greatly in the construction of the
                        new links Mr. Owen has been appointed to the responsible position of
                        superintended of the Eastern Telegraph Company at Bombay, and a banquet was
                        given in his honor on Saturday. He has been the presiding genius of golf at
                        Suez and is an all-around sportsman. A fine bowling groom has recently been
                        laid out at the Golf Club and, this addition to the many distractions of
                        Suez has been greatly appreciated. A large number of ladies have taken
                        bowling, and this innocent recreation appears to attract many votaries. The
                        Golf Club has also laid out a croquet "lawn" The word "lawn" at Suez is used
                        in symbolical sense, as there is not a blade of grass for many miles around.
                        The "lawn" consists of carefully rolled sand, chosen for its hard surface,
                        and it makes an admirable ground. The Golf Club is greatly appreciated by
                        the English colony at Suez because it forms a convenient place of assembly
                        for local gossip of an innocent and harmless character. The two tennis clubs
                        at Suez have lately received many new members. The two clubs are formed of
                        the Suez and Port Tewfik residents and the members of the Eastern Telegraph
                        Staff. Every week there are three "at homes" on the club's grounds. A
                        tournament is now being played between the members of the E. T. C, Club.

                    <head>BRITISH TRADE WITH EGYPT</head>
                    <p>A correspondent recently wrote to the President of the Board of Trade,
                        drawing attention to the fact that, according to the latest report to hand,
                        British commerce with Egypt showed a distinctly shrinking tendency. It was
                        farther suggested that the Government would do well to establish some system
                        of trustworthy inquiry in all cases where there was a falling off in trade
                        with other countries. In reply the correspondent has been furnished with the
                        figures for the last ten years, representing the proportion borne by imports
                        from the United Kingdom to the total imports into Egypt as follow:1895, 31.5
                        per cent. ; 1896, 31.1 per cent . ; 1897, 33.4 per cent ; 1898, 35.1 per
                        cent. ; 1899, 37.9 per cent ; 190n, 37.6 per cent ; 1901, 36.5 per cent;
                        1902, 36.8 per cent t. ; 1903, 35.3 percent ; 1904, 34.0 per cent It is
                        farther pointed out that, "although the proportion of imports derived from
                        the United Kingdom has declined slightly during the last few years, it is
                        still greater than in the first few of the years included above."It further
                        appears, from the official reply, "that the fluctuations in the shore
                        figures from year to year arise, to a large extent, from the variations in
                        the price of coal, the imports of which are derived almost entirely from the
                        United Kingdom. If oral be excluded, the figures will appear as follow
                        "1896, 28.1 per cent, 1896. 28.0 per cent; 1897, 30 8 per cent ; 1898, 31.4
                        per cent. ; 1899, 32.9 per cent ; 1900, 82.4 per cent; 1901, 82.3 per cent;
                        1902, 33 0 per cent. ; 1903, 31.8 per cent; 1904, 81-0 per cent </p>

                    <p>n'hésitent pas à se purger, quand elles en ont besoin. Elles ne craignent ni
                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
