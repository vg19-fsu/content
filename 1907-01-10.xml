                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE PASSING OF THE SHAH</head>
                    <p>The long-expected death of the "King of Kingshas at last taken place. His
                        Majesty's life, which had been artificially sustained for the past month,
                        has now ebbed away, and Muzafter ed Din is no more. The eyes of the whole
                        world will now be turned towards Persia, which for European diplomacy will
                        be the centre of the greatest interest. Notwithstanding the assurance
                        contained in oar telegrams of yesterday, that Great Britain and Persia, who
                        are the Powers most interested, have agreed on a common policy to bo
                        followed on the demise of the Bhah, this event may not improbably bring
                        about a crisis in the Middle Eastern questioned nothing it more likely than
                        that a break-up .of the Persian Empire may begin. It is in Persia that a
                        great struggle for political supremacy will one day he fought, a struggle
                        that cannot be confined to Persia, but mûst 'nevitably spread until its
                        over-widening circles embrace Arabia, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and the whole
                        Turkish Empire. It is a clear conception of this fact that has directed the
                        course of European diplomacy of late years. Germany, while leaving nothing
                        undone that could tend to strengthen her position in the Near East, has been
                        straining every nerve to extend her influence in the Middle East. The
                        commercial advantages which she hopes to derive from the Baghdad railway
                        are, in the eyes of ihe German Emperor, of very secondary importance in
                        comparison with the political interests which its completion would further.
                        As a commercial venture the Baghdad railway for years and years after its
                        construction must remain a very precarious investment; as a political
                        instrument for the extension of German influence in Asia its value is
                        inestimable. Thus Germany is not only directly interested in tho fate of
                        Persia,but is already actively forging weapons designed to assure her
                        political, commercial and industrial predominance there. England, however,
                        is not sitting idle while the Kaiser is wording to realize his pet project
                        of a railway from Hamburg to the Peipi&amp;n Gulf, one of the elements in
                        his vast ambitions regarding Asia Minor and Persia. She has rendered
                        impossible without her direct participation any prolongation of tho Baghdad
                        railway to an essential terminus on the Persian Gulf. She has established a
                        friendly understanding with France which has withstood two severe tests, one
                        in Morocco, when Great Britain loyally supported France, the other in the
                        Tabah frontier dispute, when France loyally supported Great Britain. And she
                        has laid the bases of a reconciliation with Russia, without which a friendly
                        solution of the Persian problem is impossible. For Russia is really' the
                        mistress of the Persian situation. From the military standpoint, her troops
                        control the northern frontier of the Empire, and from the political
                        standpoint financial operations on a colossal scale and big loans to tho
                        Shah have made her the Power behind the throne in the Empire itself. So long
                        as Muxaffer ed Din was alive no change in the situation was possible. But
                        now that he is dead? Will his suooeseor acquiesce in the existing régime,
                        will he be content to reign and let an other power rule t "That is the
                        question." If he should become enmeshed in the intrigues of the European
                        Powers, his advent to the throne may mark the beginning of one of the
                        biggest diplomatic ooofiiets known to history.</p>

                    <p>The steam tramways started *on March 5, 1904. At first (although crowded when
                        ron for trial fire trips) the pnblio did not take to them. The takings for
                        28 days in Maroh were £8. 37.533.''</p>
                    <p>The Governor might have added, says the "Sudan Times," that at the time no

                        The same flags have been hung from the same hotels, and the same deoorations
                        and illuminations have lined the streets. The same fantasias have been in

                        justice to offenders against the common peace and order. Motor cars and

                        they did in other years. There was the usual wait before H. H. the Khedive,
                        wi'h his escort of Lanoers and his reticue, arrived upon the soene and rode
                        down the lines upon his proudly stepping steed. Onoe more he took up his

                        passed by saluting. First, the well appointed Lanoers, then the field gans
                        and mole battery, after them the oadet corps and the varions regiments of

                        following them as they thundered by through the dust. On the conclusion of
                        the manœuvres the troops re-furmed in long line across the gioond to receive
                        the usual words of commendatiou from their sovereign, they in their turn

                        the present unhappy state of affairs.</p>
                    <p>I do not donbt that the offioial answer to any complaint will be that nothing
                        oan be done, or we may be told that there exists a registry for servants.
                        That any registry in the proper sense of the term really exists, I deny.
                        There is an Anthropometrioal Bareau where aooased persons are measured and
                        photographed, and where it oan be ascertained theft or other offencea.
                        Personally, I myself wonld never dream of asking a presumably respeotable
                        candidate for domestio service to submit himself to the humiliating ordeal

                        two of the many applicants I have interviewed, and these the most inferior

                    <p>Amongst other exoellent bargains now offering on the Cairo Laud Exohange is
                        that of the so-called "Garden City," an estate situate in the most
                        fashionable quarter of Cairo: the Kasr Bl-Donbara. This property, oovering
                        400.000 sq metres, lying next to the residence of Lord Cromer, was bought
                        from several Khédivial Princes in the winter of 1905 6, by the Nile Land Co.
                        The position is unique, between the Nile and tbq tramway to Old Cairo, and
                        it extends from the British Agenoy to Rodah Bridge. It is admirably
                        parcelled oat into plots of 500 metres and upwards, minus, say, 120,000 sq.
                        metres for roads and pnblio gardens. The ohief attraction of this land is
                        the faot that no bailding erected thereon may oconpy more than two-thirds
                        the area of the p'ot, so that eaoh house will have a garden ot its owu.
                        Moreover, no business establishments whatever will be allowed exoept on
                        those sites faoing the tramway. The most BtriDgent regulations have been
                        made regarding bnilding here as it is desired to make this the most
                        aristooratio quarter of Cairo. As an enoouragement to artistio architecture
                        the Nile Land Co. are to distribate £50,000 amongst the bnilders of the 12
                        handsomest villas and the three handsomest frontages facing the Kaar-El Aini

                        same year. It is here that the Rilz Hotels Oo. have selected a site for
                        their hotel. Within the last few months about 150,000 lq. metres have been
                        sold at pricer ranging from L.B. 8 to L.E. 15, but quite lately the price
                        rose to L.R. 20, and it is expected that still higher figures will be
                        reached, especially when all the land is sold.</p>

                    <p>The Mining Department of the Pinanoe Ministry is making considerable progress
                        with its system of roads in the Eastern Desert. The road from Bdfoo to Bee*
                        has been completed, and consiats of an excellent track ninety miles in
                        length. From Beta it will biforoate to the Sontb and North. The southern
                        branch of the road will go through the erne raid fields, while the northern
                        extension will join the Keneb-Kosseir road from the Nile Valley to the Red
                        Sea. Keneb is another base for a road northwards. This road is now being
                        made aloDg the old Roman way, which was ooostrnoted in order tP bring the
                        porpheiy from the Red Sea ooast to the Nile, where it was floated dowa tbe
                        river to be taken to Rome, where it still forms snoh a splendid and
                        prominent feature in many of the remains of the paiaoea and temples ot the
                        Imperial epooh. This road,, as at present planned, is to end at Ghattar,
                        which is ninety miles from Keoeb, and is half way to Gebel Zeit. Tbe
                        Edfou-Bezt road has been largely used for motoring, aod the new type of
                        motors, which have been specially built for the use of the Department of

                        less costly and diffi- onlt meaLs of conveyanoe than oamels. The longest
                        day's run in the Eastern Desert was made last midsummer, when 148 miles were
                        traversed in one day. There is no comparison with the rate of the oamel

                        night confirmed the news of the death of the Shah.</p>
                    <p>Mozaffar ed-din was 53 years of age, and has ruled fur oyer tea yearsi His
                        dynasty is comparatively modern, for it dates from 1791, when the great
                        great-grand uncle of the late Shah obtained the Crown after a civil war
                        which lasted fifeeen years, and founded the dynasty of the Kajàra, of which
                        there have been five sovereigns. Prom his fifth year Mocaffir ed-din livèd
                        in Tabris as Wali Ahd, or Heir Apparent. As he was not beloved by his
                        father, Nil-r-ed din, be was appointed Governor of the Province of
                        Az?ibijan, on the Russian frontier. The fntnre monarch was for the most part
                        fortnnate in having excellent teachers, who neglected nothing in order to
                        make him worthy to role one day over the people of Sadi, Hafiz, and Firdoci.
                        Before be bad attained his twentieth year the Heir Apparent knew not only
                        the old national language of Iran bat also Kurdish, Tarkish, and Arabio ;
                        and there is probably at this momsnt in the Bast no soholar who was the late
                        Shah's eqaal in his knowledge of anoient Oriental literature. In the
                        interpretation of the Korar, one of the most important subject* of Oriental
                        ednoation, the Shah was a master, and his personal opinions on disputed
                        points have long been held in the greatest esteem, Five times daily the Shah
                        observed the abln ticras and prayers ordained by the saored book, Moreover,
                        be never tasted wine or any other form of alooholio beverage, and this an
                        wonted abstemiousness was all the more to his oredit, as the inj inotion
                        uttered by the Koran on this point is certainly very little observed by the
                        Persians. Many songs in praise of wine, are to be found in the works of the
                        Persian poets, for the Anaoreontio singers of Iran do not confine their odes
                        to extolling the soent of the rose and the song of the nightingale. However,
                        in this respeot the Shah felt bound to set a good example.</p>
                    <p>Mnziffar ed-din devoted special attention to pbilosophioal studies, and he
                        was probably the only roler who took a delight in reading Plato and
                        Aristotle. Modern philosophy in tin form of the "System of Mouode" by
                        Leibnitz, and of Kant's "Categories," was also a favourite study. The little
                        qoart at Tabris had quite a medieval aspect, for it «as thronged by poets,
                        learned men, and philosophers ; and, in addition totbe pleasure* of the
                        chase, it was the late Shah's favonrite pastime to disonss with these men
                        the existence and object of ail things visible and invisible. Moreover,
                        Mozifiar-ed din was a keen astronome? ; he spoke Frenoh fiaently, and read
                        all the beat works written in that language. On his accession to the Throne
                        the Shah informed the Chief Priest, or ImAm, of Teheran that his chief task
                        would be to govern his people quietly and peaoefally with, the aid of the
                        Almighty. It weald be too long a task to speoiiy the varions innovations
                        intro* duoed and the methods of reorganisation set on foot by the Shah do
                        ring the ten years of his role. That the Shah's measures have been well
                        direoted is seen in the faot that he abolished eight thousand superfluous
                        official posts, and diminished hfe Civil List by 150,000 krans, or about
                        £>,625. More espeoi*lly were the people of Persia affected by his
                        publication of an Edict of ToleratioD,by the abolition of the ssttled system
                        of leasing the taxer, by making better provision for the varions pilgrimages
                        undertaken by the people, by giving a oertain amount of Bell government to
                        the towns, by the recent grant of a Constitution, and by reorganising the

                        be, he is a very intelligent and long-headed Priuoe ; and it is on that
                        aooount I am unable to aoderstand how—pending evidence to the contrary —he
                        should ever have associated himself with the Nationalist programme. Whatever
                        else he may be, the Khedive is lord and master of the Palace party,
                        supposing snch a body to have any existence in reality, and he knows Egypt
                        far too well not to be aware that even if be wished to give any moral
                        support or, still more, any pecuniary as-Htanoe to the Nationalist
                        agitation, the faot woald be com- uaunioated at onoe to the British
                        authorities in Egypt</p>
                    <p>In the earlier years of his Khedivate he did undoubtedly make an attempt to
                        assert his commaod over the Anglo Egyptian army, bat the failare of bis
                        attempt was not of a kind to enoonrage any repetition of an anti- British
                        policy. Sinoe the collapse of his is- sertion that he was still master of
                        his own troops, he has, in as far as I am aware, aeqQiesaed in the present
                        system ander whieh he remains »hs raler of Egypt de jure, while Lord Cromer,
                        as reprsseotativa of England, remains the raler dt facto. 8inoe the Anglo*

                        sopport of the one Power which could poedhly have assisted him in throwing
                        off the yoke of Eogland. On the oooasion of the Saltan's attempt to reissert
                        his olaims in the Sinai Peninrole, be supported-the rights of B^ypt, and, if
                        I am oorreotly informed, wrote a des* patch to the Saltan, at Lord Cromer's
                        instance, declaring th»t, in the event &lt; ( Tetksy trying to alter the
                        lines of demarcation between the Oitom in Empire and the Vassal State, his
                        troops woald j >in with tbs British in repelling any act of aggression. If
                        this be so, it seems incredible that, within a few weeks, he should have
                        embarked on an insame attempt to overthrow the British military oo- onpation
                        by an alliance with the Nationalist party.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the charge of having raised money by selling titles and decoration
                        , it hardly needs refutation. A stranger does not require forty years or
                        forty months or forty weeks' residence in Egypt not to be aware that from
                        time immemorial titles and deooratioos were paid for either in me»l or malt,
                        that is, by servioes rendered or by backsheesh. Even in England at the
                        present day similar rewards are not infrequently the result of payments to "
                        party '' purposes. I hardly compreheod, then, why wbat is regarded as a
                        legitimate transaction, in England shoald be denoanoed as disgr*oefol in
                        Egypt Again, neither the " Times " nor its correspondent seem to ba aware
                        that Egypt possesses no decorations of her own, aod by her convention with
                        Turkey hasa right only toalimited number of Turkish orders, suohaa the
                        Otmanli and the Medjidi, Of this limited camber by by far the largest

                        rials in the Khédivial service, who, in Lord Cromer's opinion, have done
                        good work in Egypt,</p>
                    <p>As to posts of emolomaot, the Khedive has no means of selling these to any
                        would be purchasers, even if he was so minded. The disposal of all snol^
                        posts rests with Lord Cromer and Lurd Cromer alone. His lordship's patronage
                        is exercised most conscientiously, and, from his own point of view, most
                        wisely. Every candidate for (ffice well knows that the Dot of his nomination
                        or rt commendation by tha Khedive would be rather detrimental than otherwise
                        to the chanoe of his application being favonrably reoeived at the Briti h

                        have therefore been examined in order . to see whether there is evidence of

                        day of these different years. Stonehenge is first described, and the or^en-
                        ! tation of. its principal axis to the rising bud</p>
                    <p>at tha summer solstice was determined by a \ series of observations from
                        whiob it was found . that the original orientation differed from ' tba
                        azimnth of the risiug son at the sommer solstice at the present time. This
                        durance I is asoribed to the slow, change in the obli- qaity of the eolipfio
                        ; and on this basis the date of laying ont the axip is determined, as being
                        1680 B c, or, allowing for varions sources of error, the date of
                        constfuotion is placed between 1900 and 1500 b.c.</p>
                    <p>Following this observational portion of the book is a sammarZ'd account of
                        th^ folklore connejted with these circles, and with sacred trees, wells, and
                        streams. As a result of this investigation the conolnsion is arrived at
                        that, the earliest form of worship in Britain was that of the son on the
                        most important dates of the May year, and subsequently of tha solstitial !
                        year ; and it. is maintained that this worship probably came from Egypt,
                        where th'i rising and setting points on the.horizon of stars were '
                        employed, fiat in Egypt observations were not confined to the horizon, and
                        the nght hoars were detorhrned by tha meridian passage if stare. Sir Norman
                        Lockyor has produced a most interesting work dealing with a special point in
                        arohmilogy, and rightly lays stress on the aoonraoy necessary in determining
                        the orientation of the axes of anoient strnotnres. It was certainly the
                        practice in eome oases to lay ont Egyptian temples by aligning «he axis on a
                        heaveply body, though whether it was so universally done at eaoh extension
                        or modifi oation of the bnildipg as the author has maintained is more
                        donbtfal. A temple direoted ta the plaoe of solstitial annrise may have been
                        intentionally so placed ; but in the oase of others which are held to be
                        directed to the plaoe of a oertain star's rising.a degree of cantion is
                        desirable, since tbs oase of Lnxjr Templr, on which the author lays espeoi*l
                        stress, is open to another explanation, Sir Norman Lookyer considers that
                        the three axes of this temple show a gradual shift necessitated by the
                        preces* sional movement of the star to which th^y weie direoted.</p>
                    <p>In viewofthe amount of evidence conneotihg early worship with the lanria* it
                        is not surprise</p>
                    <p>1 g that special oars shoald have been taken to mark the direotioo in which
                        the son woald appear, and this ooald be don* with considerable aoonraoy,
                        especially in the teqiples of Egypt. Here the series of rooms and courts
                        with conneotiog doorways furnish a means for testing tbeories of orientation
                        very saperior to that which it available in stone oiroles of mooh rader
                        construction. It is therefore anfortnnate that when these temples were
                        investigated less toon rate methods of observation were employed than tor
                        the British stone oiroles, ths azimoths being determined with reference to
                        the magnetic meridian, a single value for the declination throughout Egypt
                        being nsed,whi'e the height of the horison was not always determined with
                        preoision. In the oases taken as instances of stellar orientation it may
                        happen that local considérations inflaenced the position of the baildingi
                        and the oase of Luxor temple shows the need for canfion in this rMpeot.
                        Borcbardt ha* recently shown by a detailed stndy of the temple that the
                        first change of axis was in order to connect th* new extension of the temple
                        with ap avenue &lt; f sphinxes whioh led from Karoak. On the farther
                        enlargement of the temple another shift was oansfd by building along tbe
                        line of ths avenne which passed close to a small ekjsting temple erected by
                        Thohmes III. whieh probably wés still in use. Wheo this amount of doubt ean

                    <dateline>Loudon, December '29.</dateline>
                    <p>Orders have been issued for recruiting foi the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons, now
                        at Cairo, to ba limited to men not under twenty years of age, nor over
                        twenty five. A good many recruits are being obtained for this grand old
                        regiment</p>
                    <p>An ex^raord:nary escapade c f three privates of the InniskilUng Dragoons is
                        reported from Ballincollig cavalry barrack9, where the depot is stationed.
                        8hortly alter midnight on the 25th inst three privates named Donaldson,
                        Duffy, and Liorensoo pooncod npon the sentry when making his rounds, arid,
                        disarming him, proceeded to bind and gag him, after which they left him
                        helpless in a freezing atmosphere. They then entered the stables, and
                        leading three of the best troop,horses ont of the barracks monn+edapff
                        galloped fnrionsly in the direction of Blarney. Meanwhile the unfortunate
                        sentry lay prone on the square unable to stir hand or foot or even skont for
                        assistapoe. For an hoar be remained in this conditiôo. By persistently
                        robbing it against rough and frozen ground, he eventually '"'V managed to
                        remove the gag from his month and his shooting attracted the attsntion of a
                        corporal of the regiment, who about two o'clock in the -morning was
                        retnrning. from Christmas leave. This man fonnd the viotim of the freak
                        almost be combed with the cold and in an exhausted condition. He released
                        him at once and had him attended to at the barraoks. Tbe alarm was
                        immediately raised, and the abeence of the three horses from the stables was
                        no'ioed. A scouring party was organised, and towards morning the three
                        dalinqqeota were met at Carrigrohane Bridge, where they were placed nuder
                        arrest by Corporal Collier.</p>

                    <p>The Anny Council has under consideration the possibility of reducing tbe
                        présent annual allowance of praotice ball ammunition for trained cavalry and
                        infantry soldiers, Tbe proposal is principally due to representations which
                        have been msde that at some military stations the range «cootemoda' ion is
                        so restricted</p>

                            ammunition now allowed might be used op in praotice by being more

                        the market has had maoh of a semi-holiday feeling, besides being aotually
                        olosed for basiness on several days. 8iooe the resumption of business
                        yesterday morning better feeling has prevailed, and prioee havo experienced
                        a fair recovery. To-day's closing values are, for the ourrent month, 25

                        than those of the 20 h December. The improvement seems chiefly due to a more
                        oheerfal view of the general situation, the protpeot of easier money, and
                        the continued aotivity and prosperity of the spinning frade. 4</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>

                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
