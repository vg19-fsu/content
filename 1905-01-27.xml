                    <head>RUSSIA'S NEW DODGE.</head>
                    <p>We have at last reached a stage in the war when we have to take into our
                        calculations the probable effect on its future development of Russian
                        desperation. The deliberate violation of Chinese neutrality by the cavalry
                        of Mischenko, together with the threats contained in the recent Note to
                        Peking and the Powers charging China with affording assist ance to Japan,
                        are full of ominous significance. Puerile and fictitious as these charges
                        are <cb n="6"/> they have been made with deliberate purpose, and the more
                        they are considered the greater reason there appears for the apprehension
                        that the Russian Government is preparing for a step which will merge the
                        present issue between herself and Japan into a chaos of fresh complications.
                        The acceptance by the two belligerents in February last of the American Note
                        defining the Liao River as the inviolable western boundary of the theatre of
                        war has until Mischenko's raid been strictly - adhered to. Now, however,
                        Russia has of set purpose broken through this agreement, and her Note
                        complaining of belligerent acts on the part of China is intended as her
                        excuse, and will be made the pretext for further violations of Chinese
                        territory as soon as ever it suits her purpose. This Russian mood is born of
                        despair, and it will probably only need another serious deleat on the
                        Sha-ho, to bring about its full development in the shape of a hostile
                        incursion into Chinese territory to the west of the Liao, or more probably
                        an attack by way of Turkestan or the Goui towards Peking, if pressed beyond
                        the Hun-ho by the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>The westward extension of the belligerent area towards the Chinese border
                        will lessen the Russian power of concentration as well as that of Japan. If
                        therefore Kuropatkin is hoping by such a diversion to weaken Oyama's eastern
                        flank, his attempt can only fail, and the sinister suggestion of the recent
                        move is a deliberate intention on the part of St. Petersburg to force China
                        into a belligerent position, trusting to the subsequent contusion of the
                        international situation to enable her to avoid a fight to a humiliating
                        finish with Japan. Russia will by this means obtain the more active
                        assistance of France and Germany. The scheme of involving Cuina will also do
                        more. Whereas now Russia has no legitimate raison d'être on Chinese
                        territory in Manchuria, if China can be treated as a belligereut the
                        intruder will at once advance combatant rights to as much as he thinks he
                        can make good a claim to when the time of final settlement arrives. Russia's
                        new move, therefore, looks like part of a deeplaid scheme to avoid the full
                        consequences of impending final deteat at the hands of Japan. We have been
                        afforded a preliminary view of its initiation. And it is probable that we
                        shall not have to wait long for further developments.</p>

                    <p>STEAM TRAWLING IN LOCAL WATERS. The Port Said works of the Cold Storage
                        Company, Ltd, are now rapidly approaching completion. There can be no doubt
                        that the public of Cairo anticipate with much satis faction the prospect of
                        obtaining sufficient and regular supplies of the best meats and other
                        produce, as imported by this company, at reasonable prices. We understand
                        that the first consignment of meat will arrive in the course of the next few
                        days, and comprises the finest Australian and New Zealand beef, mutton,
                        lamb, etc., which will be on sale to the public in the New Market, Cairo, on
                        ot before February 1.</p>
                    <p>With the object of furnishing the market with regular supplies of good fish,
                        the company are bringing out a steam trawler, which will commence work early
                        next mouth. It is in tended to inaugurate steam-trawling in Egyp tiau waters
                        on a systematic basis. The success of steam-trawling in all other countries
                        warrants the belief that it may be carried on with success here, and that it
                        will lead to more constant supplies of fish to our markets. A steam trawler
                        is able to go out and to return to port at all times, and in any weather.
                        and is therefore independent of conditious which msterially restrict the
                        operations of sailing ves sels. By this means also it is possible to reach
                        the deeper fishing grounds, and it is expected that a much better and larger
                        class of fish will thereby be obtained.</p>

                            <p>By order of the Tsar, General Trepoff and the Minister of l Finance

                                being exploited by sell-seeking and evil-disposed persons who nave
                                misled them in a manner rendering the intervention of an armed force
                                inevitable. The workers forget that the Government has always been
                                careful for their needs and is ready now, as always in the past, to
                                listen to the just desires of the people and to satisfy them
                                whenever possible. The workers must, however, assist the Government
                                by the restoration of order, by returning to their work, and by
                                boycotting the inciters of disorder. Their needs are near to the
                                Emperor's Heart as are those of all loyal subjects, Only recently

                                insurance, and He Has now directed the Ministry of Finance to draft
                                a law for shortening the hours of labour, and to take measures for
                                making it legally possible lor the working classes to discuss and
                                make known their needs. The Government will protect all those who
                                return to work.</p>
                            <p>The Municipality Has voted by a large majority 2,500 sterling towards
                                the relief of the wounded and the families of the killed. A further
                                200 has been voted towards the improvement of the ambulance
                                stations, in view of a repetition of the tragedy. This vote was
                                originally coupled with a motion strongly denouncing Sunday's
                                brutanty, which, however, the President refused to accept.

                        rental of L.E. 2,000 a year, including the garden and all the appurtenances
                        of this fine mansion. The bank has also obtained the option of renewing the
                        lease at the end of the term.</p>
                    <p>The bank intends to build on to thé garden at the back of the building and to
                        turn the house into large and commodious banking premises. Mr. Llewelyn, who
                        is to represent the bank as general manager for Egypt, will stay at
                        Alexandria permanently and will take charge of all - the bank's operations
                        in this country.</p>
                    <p>The building will bo transformed immediately and the bank will be fully
                        installed early in the coming summer.</p>
                    <p>The Comptoir National d'Escompte has a capital of 150,000,000 francs, fully
                        paid up, m 300,000 shares of 500 francs each. It is a Société Anonyme, which
                        took over the business of the Comptoir d'Esoompte de Paris, which went into
                        liquidation in 1889. The duration of the company is 50 years from 1st May,
                        1889. The business of the Banque de Dépôts et Comptes Courants was taken
                        over from July, 1892, for 30,000 fully-paid shares. It is one of the
                        greatest banks in France and on a par with the Credit Lyonnais. The
                        directors anticipate a rapid development of business in Egypt. An agency in
                        Cairo will be opened next year and it is probable that the bank will also
                        extend its sphere of operations to the Sudan.</p>

                        the guard some ingenious person interposed no less than 16 other trucks.
                        Under these circumstances it is hard to say whether the theft took place at
                        Abbassieh or during the journey, and it has not been established that the
