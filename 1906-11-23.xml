                        Sudan in his book, "From Midshipman to Field Marshal." Referring to
                        Major-General the Hon. J. Dorme', hd says: "Two sheikhs rode into the
                        general's camp with a message from the Mahdi, exhorting him and his follow
                        era to submit and thus save their bodies in this world, and their souls in
                        the next, by embracing the Mohamedan faith. The sheikh talked of the
                        wondrous powers of the Mahdi, and when Dormer differed with him, said,
                        'Well, can you do the marvelous things the Mahdi performs, such as praying
                        for rain and ensure its falling?' Dormer, like all of us, knew that the
                        Mahdi only prayed for rain when his barometer was falling, and having
                        himself but one eye, be turned his back to the sheikhs, and taking oat his
                        glass eye be threw it up the air and caught it, saying, 'Can your Mahdi do
                        that' The sheikhs turned and ran without a word."</p>

                    <p>Cairo Model Workshops </p>
                    <p>Johnson Pasha, in his report on that excellent institution, the model
                        workshops at Cairo, during the past year, remarks:-</p>
                    <p>This being the third year of the first four years' course in the Cairo Model
                        Workshops it is satisfactory to be able to state that the results justify
                        the experiment even more fully than did those of the first and second years
                        which had already decided the Government to extend the operation of the
                        system. The work his therefore almost passed beyond the stage of experiment.
                        We can fairly say that the result is success: the question to be solved at
                        the end of 1906 is how great the measure of successes. I have no doubt that
                        in the future considerable modifications in detail will be necessary. These
                        establishments are being created to meet an urgently fell want. The country,
                        and Cairo especially, is developing in certain directions at extraordinary
                        speed, and this development naturally brings special needs into prominence.
                        As this pressure diminishes, and what is now wanted urgently, and eagerly
                        sought or, becomes a normal asset, other needs will be felt, and other
                        demands will be made; and it will be for those then in control of the system
                        to feel to a certain extent the pulse of the country, in regard to this
                        matter, and to introduce such modifications as regards I number of subjects
                        taught, higher development, and greater specialization as altered j
                        circumstances may indicate, bearing in mind always the principle underlying
                        this work—that theory should be the handmaid of practice.</p>

                    <p>Egypt is becoming more and more a centre of interest for American scholars
                        and tourists. The enormous and ever-increasing incrusion of Americans, who
                        people the Nile each winter from Cairo to Khartum, bears witness to this
                        fact, while the numerous representatives of science and learning who are now
                        busily engaged in practical research mark the more serious concern which tbe
                        educational aspect of Egypt has among the Americans.</p>
                    <p>During the coming season Mr. Albert M. Lythgoe, who has heretofore
                        represented the Boston Museum and Harvard University in the field, is to

                        and skilled excavators in the field, and his course in the work which he is

                        papyrus manuscripts acquired recently by the University of Heidelberg, which
                        has secured what was known as the Schott Reinhardt collection.</p>
                    <p>The documents are not in every case papyrus ones, there being a wooden tablet
                        inscribed with part of the seventh Sura of the Koran, an Arabic letter
                        written upon the blade bone iof a goat, a tradition-soroll containing the
                        Sahifa of Ibn Lahia, and an extremely old Arabic book dated Hegira 239.</p>
                    <p>The most important documents are a large number of splendidly written texts
                        concerning (financial matters connected with Korra-ibn Bharik, governor of
                        Egypt, in the second half of the first century of the Hegira. A selection of
                        the most important of the papyri has been published under the editorship of
                        Dr. C. H. Becker, of Heidelberg, in a costly volume which does credit to the
                        University. There are autotypes of the texts, transliteration and
                        translation, a complete introduction, and a lexicon of the more important
                        Arabic words. In the Museums of Vienna, Cairo, Berlin Heidelberg there are
                        now sufficient Arabic records to satisfy the wish of any competent Moslem

                        view. A work that is sure to be attempted by European scholars, if some

                        taken place in the Councils of the Porte. That capricions and besetted
                        Government is said to have so far deviated from the system and principles to
                        which for several years it has owed its political existence, as to have
                        dissolved its alliance with Russia. Advices to this effect have been
                        received by the 'Rose' cutter, whose arrival from the Mediterranean we
                        yesterday mentioned This is certainly a misfortune of some magnitude at this
                        moment, when we hoped to see the undivided energy of Russia directed against
                        the common enemy But we trust that great Empire possesses efficient strength
                        to combat Bouraparte in the West of Europe, and to overwhelm with disgrace

                    <p>Before a meeting of the Central Asian Society, on Wednesday last week, a
                        paper was read by Mr. Valentine Chirol on "The Pan-Islamic Revival."
                        Lieut.-General Sir Edwin Collen presided, and there was a large attendance,
                        including Mr. Ameer AH, Sir Lipel Griffin, Sir Thomas Gordor, Mr. T.W.
                        Arnold, and Mr. G. de Wesselitsky.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman, in introducing Mr. Chirol, said that he was well-known as a
                        distinguished traveler and a deep student and authority in regard to Eastern
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chirol said that we often spoke—rather light heartedly—of the British
                        Empire as, among other things, the greatest Mahomedan power in the world,
                        and unquestionably no Sovereign counted among his subjects so many millions
                        of Mahomedans as King Edward. This was a factor of the greatest importance
                        in considering the interests and the future of the British Empire, for, in
                        the East, religion was still a force more potent than any other. Both in
                        Egypt and in India we had reminders, which had come as a surprise to many,
                        that Islam still represented an elemental force with which British
                        statesmanship might have seriously to reckon. Abdul Hamid had, he remarked,
                        successfully applied himself, with mingled daring and conning, to the two
                        fold task of restoring the despotic power of the Sultanate at home and of
                        seeking compensation for the curtailment of his temporal dominions by
                        reviving and extending throughout the Mahomedan world the spiritual
                        authority to which he laid claim as heir to the Khalifate of Islam. The
                        claim of the Turkish Sultans to the Khalifate dated only from the 16th
                        century, and arose out of the conquest of Egypt. The Sultan Selim's
                        triumphant entry into Aleppo was the occasion when for the first time at a
                        Friday service in the mosque the title of Protector of the Holy Places was
                        ad led to the other titles of the Ottoman Sultans. From that date to this
                        none of Selim's successors had allowed the title to lapse. It was daring the
                        complications which led to the British occupation of Egypt that Yildiz Kiosk
                        appeared to have become the seat of an organised propaganda on behalf of
                        what had come to be known as Pan Islamism. That was 25 years ago. and the
                        channels through which Pan- Islamism worked were so tortuous that its slow
                        but steady progress attracted but little attention, except from those who
                        knew something of the East, until the events of the last 12 months in Egypt
                        revealed, as in a sudden blaze of light, the activity of the forces which we
                        had ignored with our usual self-complacency. The word prestige was
                        deprecated nowadays in humanitarian quarters as redolent of obsolete
                        militarism and barbarism, bat in the East it had lost none of its potency,
                        and throughout the East, wherever Mahomedans congregated, the name of Abdul
                        Hamid had been steadfastly magnified, with results which we were now
                        beginning to realize. Among the concrete facts of Abdul Hamid's Pan-Islamic
                        policy none was more remarkable and significant than the construction of the
                        Hedjaz railway, which would ultimately link up the seat of his temporal
                        power as Sultan at Constantinople with the teat of his spiritual power as
                        Khalif at Mecca. The railway was expected to reach Medina in 1910, and Mecca
                        about three years later. After some remarks on the effect of Abdul Hamid's
                        policy in Persia and Afghanistan, Mr. Chiroi remarked that, after all, the
                        question of permanent importance to us was whether, and to what extent, Pan
                        Islamism had reached the great masses of our Indian Mahomedans, who numbered
                        roughly, one-fourth of the whose population of our Indian Empire and of whom
                        the vast majority were Sunnis, like the Turks. In what light exactly the
                        Mahomedans of India viewed the Sultan's claim to the Khalifate was a point
                        of no small interest. In many mosques his name appeared to be used in the
                        Friday prayers, but excellent authorities assured us that this did not imply
                        anything more than a mark of respect and reverence for a great Mussulman
                        Sovereign. One could not but infer from various utterances that the
                        influence which Abdul Hamid was beginning to exercise as the Khalif of Islam
                        over the minds of I dian Mahomedans was causing among the more loyal and
                        enlightened section of the Mabomedans community in India a certain measure
                        of apprehension, and that they felt the time had come openly to
                        discountenance its growth. This was a matter which deserved dose and serious
                        consideration at the hands of our rulers, especially at a time when the
                        Mahomedans of India warp, rightly or wrongly, disposed to believe that their
                        interests no longer received from the supreme Government the same impartial
                        treatment to which they had hitherto been accustomed. He did not wish to
                        enter upon controversial questions which had lately been raised in regard to
                        British administration in India, but the fact remained that recent events
                        had produced upon the minds of not a few Indian Mahomedans the impression
                        that their rights as a minority had been sacrificed, and were likely to ho
                        still farther sacrificed in the future to the claims of the Hindu majority,
                        and merely in their opinion, because the Hindu majority had had recourse to
                        methods of agitation which the Indian Mohamedans had not considered to be
                        compatible with a deep sense of loyalty towards the British Raj. Whenever a
                        real change tool place at Constantinople—whether it were in Abdul Hamid's
                        lifetime or more probably when he was gathered in due conrse to hi
                        forefathers it might he bored that whatever British Government was in power,
                        would take the earliest opportunity of showing in the face of the Mahomedan
                        world that British policy was inspired by no settled antagonism to Turkey,
                        but, on the contrary, was prepared to respect and even to support, both the
                        temporal and the spiritual authority of tb Sultan solong as those were not
                        employed to subserve purposes of hostility to the British Empire.</p>

                    <head>Drink In the Sudan</head>
                    <p>We have received the following communication from Mr. R. Fox Bourne,
                        secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society :—</p>
                    <p>To ThE Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette.' </p>
                    <p>Sir,—In your issue of 2nd November you comment on a letter dated 3rd October
                        written by me on behalf of the Aborigines Protection Society to Sir Edward
                        Grey, in which incidental reference is made tithe policy of the Sudan
                        Government in dealing with the liquor traffic, and yon quote some figures in
                        support of your statement that "it is difficult to see how the Aborigines
                        Protection Society can think the policy very effective."</p>
                    <p>Allow me to point out that neither in the letter in question nor anywhere
                        else has the Society suggested that the Sudan policy is "effective." It has
                        done no more than refer to that policy as "an example worthy of being
                        followed" in other parts of Central Africa under European control. The
                        policy may be inadequately carried out or violated in practice; but its
                        avowed intentions, and so far as we know its practical working, seem to be
                        an improvement on anything we know of elsewhere, seeing that the professed
                        object is to do all that possibly can be done towards preventing natives of
                        Africa from being contaminated by European liquor.</p>
                    <p>We have not information enabling us to say to what extent this object has
                        been achieved or has failed in its purpose. Bat official information,
                        supplementing and slightly correcting that contained in Lord Cromer's
                        reports, does not agree with the figures and inferences given in your
                        article of 2nd November. It appears that the quantity of beer and alcoholic
                        liquors (including light wines as well as spirits) admitted into the Sudan
                        from October 1900, to October, 1901, amounted to 240 tons, and in the
                        corresponding period 1904-1905 to 480 tons. In the return for 1900-1901 the
                        totals for beer and liquors are not separated, nor is the estimated value
                        stated, but in that for 1904-1905 the entry is "Beer 168 tons; L.E. 30,240.
                        Liquors 312 tons; L.E. 84,240." This shows an apparent doubling of the
                        importation in the course of 4 years—not an unreasonable increase
                        considering the growth of the European and foreign floating population,
                        military and civilian, in the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>It is alleged, with how much truth I do not knew, that the estimated value
                        is, for customhouse and railway purposes at Alexandria, far in excess of the
                        reality ; being based upon gross weights, including cases, bottles, packing,
                        etc; and that, in fact, the actual value of the 480 tons imported in
                        1904-1905 should be stated as LE. 17,280 instead of LE. 114.480. In a
                        communication dated 30 h September, 1906, the Acting Consul General states
                        that, if a man drinks a bottle of beer a day he would consume 30½ dozen in a
                        year, which would be represented by five eighths of a ton in railway weight;
                        if he drinks a bottle of claret a day his consumption will he represented by
                        rather more than two-thirds of a ton of rail way weight in the course of a
                        year." We are not told how much brandy or whisky is imported and consumed in
                        the Sudan, but, if Mr. Findlay's figures are accurate, there seems no reason
                        for supposing that even 480 tons of beer and liquors of all sorts might not
                        be consumed in a year by 2,787 Europeans and other aliens, including women
                        and children, without any of it reaching the native population.</p>
                    <p>I may add that the foregoing particulars were furnished by Lord Cromer's
                        representative in reply to questions asked in the House of Commons last July
                        on behalf of this Society. </p>

                    <p>An Aintab correspondent of the "Levant Herald" writes :—</p>
                    <p>At about eight o'clock on Thursday morning, Oct. 25, as Mr. 8anders was
                        riding from the College to the new Girls' Seminary building, he was thrown
                        from his horse, striking the back of his head. He Was carried in a state of
                        coma to hospital and expired at sunset, death being due to extensive
                        fracture of the base of the skull.</p>
                    <p> Funeral services for Mr. Sanders were he'd on Fri lay afternoon at the First
                        church, a large congregation being present. The bearers were college
                        students. Professor H. A. Bazlian spoke of Mr. Sanders' peculiar
                        qualification in physique, sympathy and self denial for his work as a
                        touring missionary. Dr. Shepard spoke of him as the man of wide information
                        who might have been equally successful in any one of a number of lines of
                        work, as the faithful friend, and as the Christian who had conquered himself
                        in a high degree and whose heart was not in this world. The service at the
                        grave was conducted by Rev. D kran Rejebian, pastor of the third church,
                        which Mr. Sanders attended regularly when in Aintab. The grave is in the
                        college cemetery, in the place which he long ago marked out, beside the
                        grave of his wife. </p>
