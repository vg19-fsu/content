                    <head>PORTUGUESE COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT.</head>
                    <p>The tour which the Crown Prince of Portugal has just completed in the African
                        colonies of that Power serves to draw attention, says the "Globe," to their
                        quick development of late years after a long period of utter stagnation. In
                        Livingstone's time they seemed to be a mere hunting ground for official
                        incompetence and ignorance. Then came a period when it seemed that only
                        Portuguese pride in her ancient possession prevented her disposing of them
                        at a price to the highest bidder; in that case inevitably England. Now,
                        whether spurred on by the example of more virile neighbours, or roused to
                        new exertions by a fresh lease of energy, it really appears that à new era
                        of progress is in store for the oldest modern colonising nation in Africa.
                        Railways are being built connecting the Eastern and Western Coasts with the
                        still scarcely known interior, and a plan is already sketched out for a
                        junction with the projected British through line. As English engineers and
                        English contractors have the work in hand, it is difficult at present to say
                        how much Portugal herself is responsible for the new order of things, and
                        how much she will profit therefrom. Until she can reform her Colonial Civil
                        Service, whether on lines that have proved successful elsewhere or in her
                        own way, there will not be much fundamental change. That is the rock on
                        which the Portuguese ship of state has always split.</p>

                    <head>THE IRRIGATION SERVICE<lb/>REPORT FOR 1906.<lb/>CONVERSION WORKS IN MIDLLE
                        EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The total area of basin converted last year was 64,556 feddans. The cost of
                        this conversion, including all subsidiary works and the remodelling of the
                        Ibrahimia Canal, was L.E. 698,930. </p>
                    <p>The latest estimates for the completion of these works were given in the
                        Public Works Report for 1905. I have something to say about the figures
                        given. </p>
                    <p>This total area of basin converted to the end of 1906—was 286,618 feddans. </p>
                    <p>The expenditure up to the same period was L.E. 2,466,498. This is equivalent
                        to a rate of rather less than L.E. 9 per feddan. In consequence of the rise
                        in the price of land and labour, the total estimate prepared in 1905, and
                        amounting to L.E. 3,200,000, had in 1906 to be increased by another million,
                        and now stands at LE. 4,200,000. </p>
                    <p>If to the expenditure to the end of 1906 as above given be added that
                        allotted in the Budget for 1907, namely, LE. 619,000, the total sum expended
                        at the end of the current year will be LE. 3,085,498. This deducted from LE.
                        4,200,000 leaves a balance to be expended in 1908 and 1909 equivalent to
                        L.E. 1,114,502. </p>
                    <p>Unless there should be a further rise in the rates for land and labour, this
                        sum will be sufficient to complete the entire conversion works by the flood
                        of 1909. We have, however, no assurance that the present rates may not, in
                        the interim, still further rise. Should this be 80, the estimates must again
                        be re-cast. In some of the earthwork adjudications held last year the rates
                        tendered showed a rise of 60 per cent over the average of those for three
                        preceding years. </p>

                        <head>THE ESNEH BARRAGE.</head>
                        <p>In order to improve the irrigation of the | Keneh province during flood
                            it was decided to construct a barrage across the Nile immediately north
                            of the Esneh town. The barrage will be an open weir of 120 bays, each 5
                            metres wide ; abutment piers 4 metres thick occur at very tenth opening,
                            the intermediate piers being 2 metres thick ; the piers are spanned by
                            arches carrying a roadway 16 metres wide. Two regulating gates, one
                            apper and one lower, each 3 metres high, will be provided for each
                            opening ; double grooves will be so arranged as to allow both gates to
                            drop on to the floor--thus, the upper gate will act as a weir with a
                            movable crest. On the western side a look 16 metres wide, large enough
                            to pass the largest steamers on the Nile, will be provided. The design
                            is similar to that of the Assiout Barrage. All the necessary plant and a
                            considerable quantity of materials were collected during the year
                            offices, dwellings for the staff and workmen, stores and hospitals were
                            all completed. At the beginning of December a commencement was made on
                            the excavation for the east abutment and part of the barrage : ten days
                            later the sadd for enclosing the look on the western bank was started.
                            The works have vigorously pushed on, and a good season's work is
                            anticipated. </p>
                        <p>The total expenditure, including cost of land and buildings, amounted to
                            L.E. 158,911, most of which was for advancès on plant and materials
                            according to the contract. </p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">(Continued.)</hi></p>
                    <p>Given Egypt's sound economic condition, and given a sudden and substantial
                        fall in the values of the first-class Securities due to forced sales to meet
                        a financial crisis-a crisis traceable to clearly-defined causes having no
                        relation to the intrinsic value of the said first class securities my
                        argument, broadly stated, is that a most favourable opportunity-which should
                        be promptly seized-has been created for bonä fide, British investors to
                        place money in Egyptian securities, subject always to the desirability of
                        maintaining that properly-balanced geographical distribution of capital
                        which is nowadays accepted as a first principle of sound investment. Many
                        who ventured to invest capital in Egypt during the past winter did so on the
                        crest of a boom-wave and did not take the precaution to thoroughly and
                        carefully examine the security offered. To-day they should first satisfy
                        themselves as to the absolute soundness of the statement contained in this
                        article, and then promptly act. Now, I submit that I have clearly
                        established that Egypt's economic condition is excellent and that forced
                        sales of good Egyptian securities have taken place. It remains but to show
                        that the securities I shall enumerate are intrinsically sound. w. . . </p>
                    <p>We will first consider the standing of the National Bank of Egypt, which was
                        created by Khedivial decree in 1898. The capital is three millions, in £10
                        shares, fully paid-up, and the reserve fand already stands at a million and
                        a balt-a creditable record. A further Khedivial decree was issued last June
                        authorising an increase of £500,000 in the Bank's capital. (As to the issue
                        of the new shares I will comment later on). The Governor is an Englishman,
                        but the Board of Directors is cosmopolitan, and counts among its members
                        many of the names best known in high financial circles in Egypt. It is not
                        actually a State Bank, though it has the practical monopoly of nearly all
                        the Government business, but very shortly its already intimate relations
                        with the State will be drawn yet nearer. For as late as last March Lord
                        Cromer reported that "the negotiations with the National Bank of Egypt, with
                        the object of establishing closer relations between that institution and the
                        Government, have made considerable progress," and I am credibly informed
                        that since that date the points then remaining unsettled have been arranged,
                        and that the final agreement now but awaits signature by the contracting
                        parties. Among the principal advantages which will accrue to the Bank are
                        that the Government will hereafter deposit with the Bank the entirety of its
                        balances, an arrangement which will, inter alia, effect great economy in
                        regard to the transport of specie, and that the Bank's business in the
                        country districts will doubtless expand and extend. </p>
                    <p>One of the main reasons which primarily induced the Government to assent to
                        the creation of the National Bank was a desire to facilitate the solution of
                        the question of the indebtedness of the fellaheen by endeavouring to rescue
                        the peasants from the clutches of the rapacions village usurers. The
                        measures taken were at first tentative and confined to certain districts. In
                        1899, 1,580 advances, amounting in all to £4,780, were made by the Bank at
                        reasonable rates. By 1901 the number of advances had increased tenfold, and
                        aggregated over £400,000, and the operations having thus rapidly multiplied
                        a separate institution was started to take over all the National Bank's
                        outstanding loans and to further extend the system. </p>
                    <p>This institution was named the Agricultural Bank of Egypt, and it has to-day
                        an authorised share capital of £3,740,000 (all issued and fully paid up),
                        and an authorised Debenture Capital of £6,570,000 in 81% Bonds, directly
                        guaranteed by the Government of Egypt. There are 496,000 Ordinary shares of
                        £5 each. The Governor of the National Bank is the Chairman. It was agreed
                        that 9% interest might be charged on the advances made by the Bank, but that
                        no loan to any one individual should exceed £300. Recently this limit has
                        been slightly extended. It was further stipulated that when the loans should
                        reach a total of seven millions sterling the maximum rate of interest
                        charged to the peasants should be reduced to 8%; and the Bank's business bas
                        in the last five years increased so marvellously that the seven millions
                        total has already been attained, and the lower rate of interest actually
                        came into force as from 1st of January, 1907. Powerfully, indeed, does the
                        Bank assist towards the elimination of the village, usurer and towards the
                        consequent sounder prosperity of the country - first by advances of selected
                        seed (in kind) and then by loans to the peasant farmers during the time
                        their crops are in the ground. With most praiseworthy regularity the
                        advances of seed are paid for and the loans reimbursed with interest as soon
                        as the crops come to maturity and are sold. The net profits of the
                        Agricultural Bank amounted to £558,275 for the financial year 1906, and the
                        last dividend declared, on the Ordinary shares, was 9% for the year. </p>
                    <p>The world's money market, I admit, is fickle, sensitive and syo pathetic
                        fickle, in that often, when the balance of probability points indubitably to
                        a rise or a fall, the market without apparent reason will jump the other
                        way; sensitive, in that it at once feels and reflects the slightest distant
                        shock, is buoyant or depressed, according to the rising or falling of the
                        political barometer, nay, even bright of doll weather at times affects it;
                        and sympathetic, in that a happy tone in certain stooks will communicate
                        itself to other shares having <cb n="4"/>no possible connection with the
                        rising market, and vice versd. Therefore, it is evident that bond fide
                        investors who are prepared to look up their securities have a substantial
                        advantage over the would-be profit-snatchers, who, though acting on
                        information which is often in the main correct, nevertheless come to
                        untimely grief through not being able to hold on long enough. </p>
                    <p>Serious investors who buy sound securities may be likened to farmers who sow
                        good seed in properly-prepared soil. As the farmer, in the almost certain
                        expectancy of an abundant crop, waits patiently for his harvest, so likewise
                        the investor, who, before placing his funds assures himself of the soundness
                        of his purchase, may contentedly possess his soul in patience. True it is
                        that the farmer's crop, owing to climatic or other cases, may not always
                        fulfil his brightest dreams, and equally certain is it that the influences
                        mentioned above the fickleness and sensitiveness of the money market-may
                        reduce, or postpone, the investor's hoped-for profits. Yet, taking one year
                        with another, the careful farmer will find little to complain of, and the
                        prudent investor must succeed in the long run. </p>

                    <p>We are authorised to emphatically contradict the report appearing in the
                        French edition of "L'Egypte" ("Egyptian Morning News") that the object of
                        Borton Bey's visit to Cyprus was other than that of taking a short holiday.
                        "Irregularities," says our contemporary "have been detected in the postal
                        service of the island, prejudicial to the Egyptian Postal Administration,
                        and Borton Bey has visited these places in order to follow the progress of
                        the enquiry opened by the consular authorities, the result of which is not
                        yet known." Such a statement, we are informed, is entirely erroneous and
                        misleading, and Borton Bey's short visit to Cyprus was in no way for
                        official purposes.</p>

                    <head>GOVERNMENTAL CHANGES.</head>
                    <p>Considerable discussion has been caused by the many changes which are
                        rumoured as about to take place in the official world, and though we shall
                        probably find a few of these will not become an accomplished fact for a
                        considerable length of time, it is undoubtedly the case that there will be
                        vacancies in offices of every grade before many months have elapsed. The
                        resignation of Sir Vincent Corbett was somewhat of a surprise when his
                        intention became known, and the appointment of Mr. Hervey considerably
                        astonished many onlookers, but this has rightly been approved by the public,
                        and, as we remarked at the time, Mr. Hervey is eminently qualified to fill
                        the onercus post of Financial Adviser. Regarding other posts of high grade,
                        which are about to be vacated in the near future, rumour is very busy with
                        names. We have heard it remarked that there is danger of too much new blood
                        being introduced into the country, and of the men of experience being
                        superseded by those whose knowledge of the country and its conditions is not
                        sufficiently wide, but we are confident that the selection of new or old
                        officials for the various posts may be safely entrusted to Sir Eldon Gorst.

                    <p>The marriage took place yesterday at Mustapha Pasha Barracks of
                        Serjeant-Instructor, Gymnasium, Bertram D. Matthews to Miss Charlotte F.
                        Nunn, daughter of Mr. J.F. Nunn, of Mustapha, the service being solemnised
                        by the Rev. Norman Lee, M.A., Senior Chaplain to the Forces. The service was
                        fully choral and the Garrison Church was crowded with friends of the bride
                        and bridegroom. The bride was looking very pretty in a handsome dress of
                        white silk voile over satin, with an orange blossom wreath, and wearing two
                        heavy gold bangles, the gift of the bridegroom. The | bridesmaids were Miss
                        Lena and Mabel Nunn, sisters of the bride, and the duties of best man were
                        filled by Quartermaster Starks, R.E. After the ceremony a reception was held
                        in the gymnasium school and was attended by some 200 guests. The band of the
                        Royal Dublin Fusiliers gave a very good programme during the afternoon,
                        under the batôn of Band-Sergeant A. Crook. The presents, which included
                        several cheques from relations and friends in England, were numerous and the
                        proceedings were concluded with a dance which was greatly enjoyed by all.
                        The guests were most hospitably entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Nuon. The
                        wedding was attended by many officers of the Mustapha force, and the
                        newly-wedded couple left for their honeymoon, which will be spent in Cairo,
                        amidst the cheers and re-iterated best wishes of their friends. </p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN ARABIC LITERATURE</head>
                    <p>At the time of his lamented defense the eminent orientalist Prof. 8. Arthur
                        Strong was engaged on behalf of the "Royal Asiatic Society" in editing a
                        complete text of the famous work known to Arabio students of the historian
                        Abu-l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Arabshah, which is a sort of panegyric of the
                        celebrated Sultan of Egypt, Jaqmaq. This laudatory book upon this celebrated
                        Mameluke ruler was composed when he had occupied the throne only two years,
                        but Ibn Arabshah says he had written the biography of Timour, the destructor
                        of mankind, and while he was spared to do farther work be wished to draw a
                        picture of a just and righteous monarch such as Jaqmaq was, "the father of
                        his people and a terror only to the enemies of Islam." </p>
                    <p>The book was written in Hegira 843 and 4, that is about A.D. 1489 and is a
                        composition exhibiting the very finest specimens of Arabic prose. The
                        British Museum possesses &amp; superb manuscript of the text first described
                        in the catalogue of acquisitions of Arahie manuscripts of 1894. </p>
                    <p>At Profr. Strong's death he had only finally edited the first two chapters;
                        the matter was then generously undertaken by Shams ul Ulama Sayyid Ali
                        Bilgrami, but serious ill health bas prevented his completing the task. The
                        "Royal Asiatic Society" has therefore printed the Arabic text of Profr.
                        Strong's revision in their Journal for 1907, hoping that Sayyid Ali will
                        soon complete the work, when it will be published as &amp; volume. </p>
                    <p>Sultan Jaqmaq does not appear to have been quite worthy of Ibn Arabshah's
                        encomiums, for he imprisoned the latter upon a calumnious charge when
                        seriously ill, and though released in five days from durance, he died twelve
                        days later August 25th A.D. 1450. </p>

                    <p>The learning and culture of the Arabic scholars of Cairo in the early 14th
                        century are well known, and the valuable editions of Arabio literature
                        produced by the printing presses of the Egyptian capital are to be found in
                        every great oriental library. </p>
                    <p>An instance of this is afforded in a recent essay by Profr. D. S. Margoliouth
                        entitled "Contributions to the biography of Abd-elKadir of Jilan", founder
                        of the celebrated Kadiri order of Moslems. He was a saint and most powerful
                        religious orator, who like modern revivalists exercised his powers of
                        persuasion among the criminal classes of the great city of the Caliphs. </p>
                    <p>For his treatise Profr. Margoliouth utilises a life of Abd-el-Kadir composed
                        in Hegira 980 by Mahommed Ibn Yahya and printed at Cairo in 1303, another
                        biography of the saint originally written in Persian but translated into
                        Arabic and printed in Cairo in A D. 1800. But the most complete foundation
                        for the historic career of Abd el Kadir of Jilan is al work written by a
                        teacher of Al Azhar who lived only about 80 years after the saint. This
                        author was Nur al-Din Abul Hasan Ali Ibn Yusuf, whose book was printed in
                        Cairo in 1304. </p>
                    <p>The manuscript edited by Profr. Margoliouth is in the Boldeian Library and
                        its contents were evidently known to the scholar of al Azhar, who sometimes
                        made copies from it. </p>

                        favourable and the prospects of an early salvage, which we held out in our
                        issue of yesterday, are well sustained by the weather conditions which are
                        as good as could be desired. After spending last night in harbour the
                        "Berger Wilhelm" returned to the "Olivemoor" at daybreak this morning,
                        taking ont with her a lighter for the reception of cargo to be discharged.
                        About 7 4. m. the salvage steamer flew two flags, as a signal, it is
                        supposed, for a second lighter, as shortly afterwards one was taken out by a
                        Ports and Lights tug. Pumping operations are still going Con and the cargo
                        is actively being discharged. The salvage steamer is to-day for the first
                        time alongside the "Olivemoor", so that operations are now greatly
                        facilitated. Official reports still bold out every hope that the vessel will
                        be got off the rocks to-morrow, . </p>

                        Professor Loos, recently honoured by the Liverpool School of Tropical
                        Medicine : -All who know Professor Loos of the Public Health Department,

                        a medal by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The Liverpool School
                        bus promoted some of the most user experiments yet undertaken and the mark
                        of their approval as manifested in the present instance is indeed a, token
                        of esteem and an honour of which our fellow townsman might well be prond.
                        Professor Loos is one of the most unassuming men in the Government service
                        and seeks not the light of publicity ; rather would he hide his light under
                        a bushel and all his friends will rejoice to hear that his devoted efforts

                        jamais apparusussi clairement que depuis l'année dernière. Les besoins
                        pressants d'argent se sont fait sentir presque sans interruption, partout de
                        la même manière et se sont manifestés par un monvement de tension de plus en
                        plusaccentué, </p>
                    <p>Le fait que, malgré les secousges violentes éprouvées, aucun soutien de
                        l'édifice n'a été ébranlé, montre la solidité des puissances finandières
                        internationales et la consolidation des bases de la situation économique du
                        monde. Ces temps derniers on a souvent accusé l'Amérique d'etre la cause de
                        tous les troubles et d'être le pays qui nous dispense peu de soleil, mais
                        beaucoup de tempête et d'orages. S'il est - vrai que les demandes énormes
                        d'argent de la part de l'Amérique depuis l'année dernière ont désorganisé
                        les marchés monétaires enropéens au point de renverser la situation de
                        dépendance de l'Amérique vis-à-vis de l'Europe, il ne faut pas perdre de vue
                        que l'Europe et les autres pays qui sont financièrement sous sa dépendance
                        (Egypte, Amérique du Sud, etc.) ont marché tellerpent vite qu'ils ont cessé
                        d'aller de pair avec la formation de nouveaux capitaux. </p>
                    <p>Cependant, lå Banque d'Angleterre a, aussi bien par des avis discrets qu'en
                        elevant le taux d'escompte à 41% donné le signal de la prudence et s'est
                        défendue des attaques dirigées contre ses réserves d'or; ceci a eu pour
                        résultat d'attirer dans ses caisser la plupart des arrivées d'or. On est
                        pourtant préparé à voir, dans un temps peu éloigné, le taux d'escompte
                        s'élever à 5%, mais il ne semble pas que la tension monétaire doive devenir
                        aussi accentuée que l'année dernière, car actuellement déja, on reconnait
                        partout la nécessité de prendre des précautions." </p>

                                are held as a guarantee of good faith. Four tribes near Casablanca
                                treating with the French are willing to give bostages, and areasing
                                their influence for peace with other tribes. Delegates from the

                                shortly be restored and also good relations with the Arabs in the

                            <p>The executive of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants have
                                issued ballots to members with regard to the question of a general
                                strike, which it strongly recommends. The ballot papers are
                                returnable on 28th October, and the decision of the executive
                                council thereon is expected by 1st November. The crux of the crisis
                                lies in the absolute refusal of the bulk of the Companies to
                                recognise the Society in negotiations with the employees with
                                reference to the latters' demands. The Liberal papers urge the
                                Railway Companies to recognise the Society. The Conserva tive papers
                                express the hope that even if the ballot approves the strike the
                                interval between now and then will be utilized to secure
                                conciliation and avert a national calamity. The prevailing belief is
                                that there will be no strike. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>NEWS OF MIKKELSEN.</p>
                    <p>The latest news received in Victoria (B.C.) of Captain Mikkelsen seems to be
                        at variance with the recent report which has reached London from Winnipeg.
                        It is beyond a doubt that particulars of Captain Mikkelsen have been
                        received later than those contained in his letter written to Sir Clements
                        Markham. Mr. D. Cadzow, a fur trader, living a solitary life within the
                        Arctic circle at Ramparts House, on the Porcupine River, near the mouth of
                        the McKenzie River, visited Victoria on his annual visit in June of the
                        present year. He travelled down as far as Dawson City with a doctor who had
                        come straight to Kampart House from Herschel Island. At Herschel Island,
                        icebound, was a whaler. The captain of this whaler had been visited by
                        Captain Mikkelsen and a member of his party. </p>
                    <p>It was ascertained from Mr. Cadzow that Captain Mikkelsen had heard from some
                        source, probably from the Stalwarth race of the Esquimos (or "Huskies") of
                        the district, about the whaler being at Herschel Island. The object of the
                        captain's visit was to obtain the opinion of the whaler's captain as to the
                        practicability of his exploration. Also to find out the best course to take
                        to make his venture a success. The whaler gave very little encouragement to
                        Captain Mikkelsen. In fact, it was the opinion on Herschel Island that the
                        exploration party must fail in their object. This is also the opinion of
                        everyone in this region who has lived for a lengthy period in the Arctic
                        circle. </p>
                    <p>It would also appear from the account of Mr. Cadzow that the Duchess of
                        Bedford bad passed Herschel Island, endeavouring to make for Albert Island,
                        but had been ice-bound between that island and the mouth of the McKenzie
                        River. At least, one point is certain, the party were not wintering in any
                        bay or part of an island, but had been frozen in for the winter in the
                        Arctic Ocean one hundred miles or more from Herschel Island, and if the
                        latest accounts received in Victoria are to be relied upon, to the east, and
                        not to the west, of Herschel Island </p>
                    <p>Mr. Cadzow is an old veteran of the Arctic Zone. He is accustomed to long
                        journeys in the depth of winter. He travels, for instance, 480 miles for his
                        mails, accompanied by a native Indian. He has to walk this distance on foot.
                        He has his dog sleigh to carry provisions for himself and his companion. But
                        no tent is carried. Everything must be done to lessen the weight for the
                        dogs. He goes out for weeks at a time henting up natives engaged in
                        collecting furs for himAll these natives live upon is dried meat. This does
                        not occupy much bulk. Even old Hudson Bay men in the old days were only
                        allowed 100 pounds of flour for the whole fort. This is dispensed with in
                        real work amongst the mountains within the Arctic zone by the natives. So
                        long as they can have their dried meat that is all they require. It may be
                        said this is their habit. Mr. Cadzow contends that this habit must be
                        acquired. He therefore ridicules any exploration undertaken on a different
                        hasis. He says it is simply ludicrous to see the amount of provisions piled
                        up for the use of exploratory parties. In short, he asserts that such
                        parties can never hope to explore a district any distance from their base!
                        This is about all they can accomplish until they learn to subsist on dried
                        meats and to lessen the loads for the dogs. </p>

                    <head>BRITISH COMMERCIAL ATTACHES </head>
                    <p>A few weeks ago was published a report by Sir Eldon Gorst and Mr. Llewellyn
                        Smith on the system of British Commercial Attachés and Commercial Agents.
                        The report suggested a few changes in the system. It proposed that
                        Commercial Attachés should have their headquarters in London and should be
                        made to oiroulate, spending a portion of their time at the Board of Trade or
                        at the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office, a second portion in
                        touring the manufacturing districts of the United Kingdom and a third
                        portion in "special investigations" abroad. Commercial Agents, the report
                        suggests, might be abolished, and their duties transferred to one of the
                        young diplomatists attached to an Embassy, to whom should be given extra pay
                        and the title "Secretary in Charge of Commercial Matters." We do not pretend
                        to believe that the changes proposed in the report will affect for good or
                        for evil the trade of the United Kingdom. The question whether the Foreign
                        Office onght to do more than it does for British trade has often been
                        discussed, as it seems to us to little purpose. The net result has been that
                        Consuls have been obliged to compile reports on the trade of their
                        districts, that these reports are printed and published, and that trade
                        benefits little or not at all from them. Other consequences have been the
                        increase of the number of Commercial Attaches and the appointment of
                        Commercial Agents, of which the result is the report to which reference has
                        been made advising the abolition of the Agents and the transformation of the
                        duties of the Attachés. </p>
                    <p>There are two views of the functions of the State in regard to the foreign
                        trade of the nation. The tradition of the laisser fain school is to let
                        trade alone-that is, to let traders take care of themselves. It may be
                        described as the Nineteenth Century view and has been accepted hitherto by
                        all British Governments. The other view is that the State should try to
                        promote the foreign trade of the country and to help traders to push their
                        business abroad. The difference between the two views is mainly one of
                        theory. The laissez faire doctrine assumes that the State cannot manage
                        trade, and that its assistance is no assistance but an impediment. The other
                        school has never in the last eighty years had much chance of practising its
                        precepts, which admit of two interpretations. One is that which made Consuls
                        send reports on trade and appointed Commercial Agents. According to this
                        view the State should help trade by employing a number of its officers as
                        commercial travellers in the interest of all trades in general and of none
                        in particular. It is not a very wise plan, because the commercial traveller
                        to be effective should be a specialist; he should represent not trade in
                        general, but boots, or Manchester goods, or reaping-machines, or some other
                        article of which he can be the qualified missionary. We are not satisfied
                        with this interpretation of the State's mission to assist the foreign trade
                        of the country. There is a different interpretation, which we prefer. If the
                        State has a mission to assist the foreign trade of the country it may carry
                        it out by employing for the purpose, not a staff of amateur commercial
                        travellers, but the national policy. That is a conception which has very
                        slowly penetrated the minds of British statesmen. Indeed it is doubtful
                        whether any British Minister or any public man of the first rank ever
                        accepted the idea in any form until Mr. Chamberlain took up his policy of
                        Tariff Reform, and even that policy os propounded by him was not so much
                        based on the conception of employing the national policy to promote British
                        trade as on that of utilising the State's power to regulate trade as a means
                        of promoting a policy. The employment of the national policy for the
                        promotion of the national trade has long been the practice of the German
                        Government. A good example is the subsidies given by the German Government
                        to lines of steamers. About twenty-four years ago Bismarek proposed to the
                        Reichstag and induced that body to consent to a system of subsidies to
                        German steamers trading to the Pacific. The intention was to push German
                        trade and to give it advantages over the trade of other Western nations. The
                        result has been an enormous growth of German trade to the Par East. If the
                        British Government had conceived of its mission as including the assistance
                        of British trade in competition with the State aided trade of other nations,
                        the German subsidies would have been immediately followed by larger
                        subsidies to British steamers on the same routes and by the repayment of the
                        Suez Canal dues to British steamers. But the British Governments of those
                        days could not grasp the idea that a British Government is there to do all
                        it can for Great and Greater Britain. The minds of politicians were cramped
                        by certain traditions which prevented them from taking an unbiased look at
                        the world or observing what was going on in that interest ing, but to them
                        remote, region, of which the boundary is for some of them the gates of the
                        Houses of Parliament and for others the shore of this island </p>
                    <p>It can hardly be the State's affair to do a tradesman's business for him.
                        That conception of the function of the State makes the State itself a trader
                        and leads directly to communism. But it may well be the State's function to
                        secure fair play for its traders. A State which respects itself must be
                        supposed to say to every foreign State, that its own traders shall receive
                        not privileges denied to others or even equality with native traders, but
                        treatment as good as is given to any foreign traders, whatever. This is, of
                        course, the idea at the basis of the "most favoured nation," clause in
                        commercial treaties. But the British Nineteenth Century doctrine of the
                        State's action in behalf of trade was that the State should regard trade <cb
                            n="4"/>as a special sphere in which only trade should be considered, and
                        that therefore most favoured nation treatment should be sought for through
                        commercial negotiations only, except in the case of places outside the
                        European sphere, where force was freely used to secure equality of
                        commercial opportunity. A truer conception would have been that which
                        assumes that all the resources of the national policy will be used to secure
                        fair play for the national trade in every country and in every market. The
                        advantage of this conception is twofold. It gives the trader confidence by
                        making him know that his Government will exert itself to to secure him
                        against unfair action of other Governments in favour of his competitors, but
                        it also gives the trader the consciousness that he has obligations to his
                        Government and must stand by it. The question was much discussed a year two
                        ago whether British manufacturers had a duty to allow their workmen, being
                        Volunteers, time to attend drills and maneuvers. If the State has no duty to
                        trade the manufacturer may forget his duty to the State. But if the State
                        considers the national trade one of the interests for the maintenance of
                        which it must act then it is clear that the manufacturer in his turn must
                        make sacrifices to enable the State to fulfil its mission of having a
                        policy, and supporting it when necessary with all its resources. </p>

                    <p>(BALLANTYNE AND HANSON. 2s.)</p>
                    <p>This is a polemie pamphlet, eloquent to the point of being almost perfervid,
                        dealing with the present state of the Bulgarian question. It takes the form
                        of an open letter to Sir Charles Dilke, and is from the pen of Mr. Neocles
                        Akasis, a professor of the University of Athens, who, apart from his
                        scholastic distinctions, is already well known in this country as the author
                        of "Hellenism and Macedonia," published some three years ago. Mr. Akasis, of
                        course, writes from the Greek point of view, and the argument which he
                        advances is no new one. He seeks to assure the British public, with all the
                        energy at his disposal, and also with the assistance of a considerable
                        amount of documentary evidence, that the unfortunate differences still
                        fermenting between the Greeks and Bulgarians are altogether the fault of the
                        last-named nation, and that the honour of civilised Europe is concerned with
                        the preservation of a state of affairs in which the Greeks shall be enabled
                        to enjoy their homes in peace. The quarrel, he maintains, is not religious
                        or sectarian, and he dismisses, with evident dissatisfaction, a letter from
                        our Archbisbop of Canterbury to the Metropolitan of Athensa letter which is
                        certainly not altogethet secure from the imputation of a sage desire to sit
                        upon the fence until affairs shall be in a more settled and pacific
                        condition. Mr. Akasis, on the other hand, sits upon no fence at all, but
                        enters the arena, sword in hand. He maintains that the Bulgarian outrages
                        upon Christian Greeks constitute a flaunting insult to civilisation, and
                        summonses the States of Europe to inquire into a system of crime which, if
                        committed by yellow, black, or red races, would have called forth the prompt
                        intervention of an international crusade. Finally, he points out that, if to
                        be forewarned was to be forearmed, the British Government has for years had
                        before it the strenuous counsel of the late Lord Salisbury, who was never
                        tired of insisting upon the inevitable evils which would spring from a
                        policy of laissez faire where Bulgarian aggrandisement was concerned. The
                        present appeal is addressed :o Sir Charles Dilke, as one of the strongest
                        and most intellectual spirits of Great Britainstrong in the face of
                        falsehood and hypocrisy, unbending and invincible in the support of truth."
                        It is impossible within the limits of a brief notice to review the various
                        and complex arguments adduced, but it may be said with bare justice that so
                        vigorous a piece of pleading is bound to attract attention, and to influence
                        public opinion in the affairs of Eastern Europe. </p>

                    <p>According to intelligence received from Northern Nigeria, a force had been
                        despatched against the warlike Dakkenkeri tribe, and was operating in their

                    <p>One of the British residents in the province, while on an assessment tour
                        with a small escort of police, was camped for the night inside a walled
                        Dakkenkeri town, when he heard of a plot to assault the cainp and murder the
                        whole party during the night. Under cover of darkness be immediately escaped
                        with his people, and succeeded in getting clear of the gates before the
                        tribesmen became aware of their flight. The Dakkenkeris savagely pursued,
                        captured and maimed all the horses, seized the whole of the baggage and kit,
                        including the bedding, and wounded some of the force with poisoned arrows.
                        Fortunately none of the Resident's party was killed or seriously hurt, but
                        they arrived at headquarters at Yelwa, on the Niger, in a very exhausted
                        condition, possessed of nothing beyond the clothes they wore, having only

                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
