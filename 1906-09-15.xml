                    <head>ENGLAND AND GERMANY.</head>
                    <p>We extract the following from an important article in the September number of
                        the "Deutsche Revue," un "German Foreign Policy," which begins by describing
                        the meeting between the (German Emperor and King Edward the most momentous
                        event of the last month. "This incident," the writer says, "leads direct
                        into the centre of European disturbance. A pacific policy in France could
                        only desire the relations between England and Germany to assume a friendly
                        character. A friend of my friend cannot be my enemy. An Anglo-German
                        understanding, therefore, offers for France the best possible guarantee of
                        peace, for no one in Germany thinks of an-aggressive war against France,
                        which, even in the event of victory, could offer us no advantages. Germany
                        has never yet embarked on an aggressive war against France. The ambitions
                        which the French Press attributes to us, now in Tripoli, now in Siam, and,
                        in fact, all over the world, are imaginary. The question therefore forces
                        itself upon us. Why does French diplomacy show itself so anxiously concerned
                        to prevent a rapprochement between Germany and England? As the reason cannot
                        be the preservation of peace, there remains only to account for it the hope
                        of support in case of war, and of a war which Franco intends to bring about. </p>
                    <p>What induces French diplomacy to persist in this direction is the assurance
                        that England<cb n="6"/> will hold unswervingly, under every Cabinet, to the
                        entente with France, which is regarded as the personal achievement of the
                        King, and which has brought him great popularity and far-reaching political
                        influence in Great Britain. The present Cabinet contains in its ranks,
                        several very Germanophil Ministers, chief among them the War Minister and
                        the Lord Chancellor. The Prime Minister, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, has also
                        repeatedly and emphatically declared that he sees no reason for England to
                        live in unfriendliness towards Germany. The Foreign Minister Sir Edward
                        Grey, is held to be an exceptionally cool head ; as in the case of the King,
                        his fellow countrymen place unconditional reliance upon his ability. Sir
                        Edward Grey sees in the entente with France the first and most important
                        object of British policy. He is willing also to allow the cultivation of
                        good relations with Germany in so far as this does not injure the entente.
                        Personally he attaches greater importance to a reconciliation' with Russia,
                        which is not, however, in his opinion, as it is in the opinion of the French
                        Press, to be directed against Germany, for he considers that it does not
                        touch Germany. He is guided by his desire to secure a stable condition on
                        the Indian frontier, and reduce the expense of the Army in India, according
                        to the general wish of the Cabinet At the present moment he is engaged in
                        negotiating at St. Petersburg with regard to Thibet in order to avoid
                        friction in that quarter. When once the negotiations with Russia concerning
                        Central Asia have been settled to the satisfaction of Germany, and should
                        negotiations then proceed with regard to the Nearer East, Sir Edward Grey
                        will certainly be prepared to come to terms with many concerning the
                        latter's interests there. The German Empire will in the meantime not regard
                        Anglo-Russian negotiations respecting Central Asia as affecting Germany, and
                        will welcome their conclusion as a favorable symptom for the general peace. </p>
                    <p>But, differing in this respect from the views of the British Secretary of
                        State, a considerable portion of the British Press advocates an agreement
                        with Russia, not with a view to the diminution of friction in Asia, but in
                        order to bring about, in the sense of the Delcassé policy, a Rapprochement
                        of the three Powers, and as far as possible of the rest of Europe, against
                        Germany. That section of the Press, therefore, regards with disfavor any
                        closer relations between England and Germany, and is persistently at pains
                        to interpret German policy in the same sense. The kernel of Anglo- German
                        relations therefore lies herein, that Sir Edward Grey shall not identify
                        himself with these French interpretations, but meet Germany with confidence.
                        In this respect the ice appears to have been broken at Friedrichshof. Since
                        the meeting at Friedrichshof, we may be justified in assuming that we are
                        travelling, though slowly and step by step, to a period of rapprochement. </p>
                    <p>Germany could argue with some force, and let us hope not without success,
                        that a peaceful policy for Great Britain can alone consist in holding
                        out-the hand to Germany, and that peace would thereby be much more
                        effectively secured than by congresses and disarmament proposals. The
                        relations between England and France would not be thereby imperilled, since
                        England has irrevocably declared that the entente with France is a permanent
                        basis of her policy. No doubt could exist on that point in France, even if
                        England were to woo Germany openly and without constraint. As for the
                        possibility of a Franco-German rapprochement—that is to say, of the more
                        friendly relations of France to Germany—false hopes and baseless fears would
                        appear still to stand in its way, and an open relationship of friendliness
                        on the part of England towards Germany might materially help to remove them.
                        The policy of ententes outside of Germany and against Germany is uncertain
                        execution and not without danger ill its consequences. This policy of
                        counterpoises will persist, however, as long as England, out of fear of
                        displeasing Paris, continues to treat with coolness the honorable approaches
                        of Germany. Germany is thereby necessarily compelled to remain on her guard.
                        Towards Germany England has only the choice between either the policy, which
                        might easily become disastrous, of an Anglo-French counterpoise, or that of
                        including Germany within the circle of friendships. These logical
                        conclusions can hardly fail to have carried weight at Friedrichshof and in
                        the British Foreign Office. Substantial results will naturally mature only
                        slowly. </p>
                    <p>Passing, then, to the question of German naval expansion and the comments
                        made upon in the English Press, the author of the article lays down the
                        necessity for England of facing the situation. </p>
                    <p>England, he says, must reconcile herself to the thought of seeing the German
                        Fleet occupy, alongside of the British Fleet a position commanding
                        andimposing respect on the sea. . . A year ago the beleif did exist in
                        Germany that our relations with England were in a stage analogous to the
                        relations of Prussia and Austria before 1866, and that in all probability a
                        cordial understanding would have to be preceded by a sharp encounter. The
                        estrangement which rendered such a belief possible, though it may not have
                        justified it, in the past. Both nations may feel confident that it will be
                        possible to arrive at a cordial agreement without any pervious armed
                        conflict.</p>

                        Water Company. This company was only recently formed in the United States

                        <p>Sir, Shareholders in the above Company had for some time the satisfaction
                            to receive few shillings per share yearly for dividend and to note from
                            returns published in newspapers the progress of the sales of salt. But
                            since the company deals without monopoly, the proprietors are completely
                            deprived of any comfort whatever.</p>
                        <p>Many of the shareholders, I believe, will be glad if they are not left in
                            the dark any longer. They must, however, be patient for say another
                            fortnight as all their principal representatives are at present enjoying
                            the last days of their leave of absence in Europe.</p>

                        <head>RESPECTING ANTHEMS.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE". Sir,-It is unfortunate that "A
                            Twenty Years' Resident in Egypt" upon his return from the villages
                            should have seen fit to continue his insinuati gainst the breeding and
                            tact of his felt untrymen in this country. Let me assure him that his
                            previous letter has caused quite sufficient resentment amongst his
                            fellow-countrymen without his further adding to it. As the criticizer of
                            his remarks, I feel bound to write once more and for the last time on
                            this absurd subject to refate his last letter. If he would be kind
                            enough to read my letter more carefully he would discover that I have
                            been careful to emphasize the fact that it is not the habit of other
                            nations to respect anthems.</p>
                        <p>That he should find in my letter any sug gestion that the conduct of
                            Englishmen should be guided by that of natives shows him to be possessed
                            of great ingenuity. I merely represented to him the other and commoner
                            side of the picture. In the incident at the Continental Hotel was indeed
                            shewn an attempt on the part of Englishmen to give natives-let them be
                            the skimmed milk of their society if you will!-a lesson in manners with
                            any poor results.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I would merely very that "A Twenty Years' Resident in
                            Egypt" need no longer flatter himself that his words of wondrous wisdom
                            resulted in the springing of every Englishman to his feet on that
                            night!</p>
                        <p>His unfortunate letter appeared in Cairo the night af er this episode and
                            could have hardly caused this unanimous act of courtesy on the part of
                            every Englishman present for the first time.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir,-Speaking from memory only,
                            and there fore under correction, it was about 18 years ago when Mr.
                            MacDonald, the then Director of the Egyptian Army Bands, tried to
                            ascertain (a) the origin of the so-called Khedivial Hymn; (b) a copy of
                            the original score and (c) a copy of the words to accompany the music,
                            as no one seemed to know whether it had to be played as a solemn chant
                            or a hybrid polka; the latter rendering seemed to be the favourite as it
                            allowed individual instrumentalists a wide field for variations and
                            embellishments, some of which still obtain. I believe that his
                            researobes resulted in the unearthing of a "fantasia" dedicated to H.B.
                            Ismail Pasha, written by an Italian Music Master and lithographed in
                            Alexandria, one number of which fantasia was the jingle under
                            discussion. As to any words to accompany the music and which might serve
                            as a guide to the interpretation of it, the only ones discovered were
                            those which Mr. Atkins fitted to part of the tune as a mnemonic, in
                            precisely the same manner as he fits his own librettcs to the numerous
                            bugle calls and salutes which are the bane of his existence, and as
                            those who have been privileged to hear them well know, they are intended
                            for private consumption only and may not be instanced here.</p>
                        <p>I believe I am correct in saying that there is no such thing as "sacred
                            music" appertaining to the Mohammedan religion, therefore Khedivial Hymn
                            or Anthem must be misnomers. The most likely thing is that the jingle
                            was adopted as a "General Salate" years ago, and tacked on to all
                            programmes in the same way as Regimental marches were and still are. To
                            stand uncovered when this "general salute" is played is not exhibiting
                            respect but ignorance. But as I have already sid, I write under
                            correction. Perhaps one of your contributors may be able to enlighten us
                            on the origin of the ro-called Khedivial Hymn.</p>

                    <p>Plant.-Mr. C. 8. Bell (oar chief engineer) has lately visited the mine, in
                        connection with the provision of additional motive power for milling. As a
                        result of his investigations, it has been decided to instal two large oil
                        engines of the slow-speed horizontal type. These are being supplied by
                        Messrs. Hornsby, and will be ready for delivery shortly. It is expected that
                        these new units will come into operation at the mines about the end of
                        December. In addition to the above, we are pleased to state that Mr. Bell
                        was able to effect such uniformity in the handling and operation of the
                        hoisting, pamping, and condensing plant as to result in an immediate fuel
                        economy of over 25 per cent., and it is expected that this saving will be
                        farther increased to about 40 per cent. in the near future. Should this
                        latter figure be attained, it will represent a fuel economy of nearly £2,000
                        per annum. A supply of coal sufficient for at least nine months has been
                        purchased on very favourable terms, and is now in course of delivery.</p>
