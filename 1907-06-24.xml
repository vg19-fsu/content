                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                    <head>COTTON INDUSTRY IN LANCASHIRE.</head>
                    <p>A change has come over the staple industry of Lancashire during the past few
                        months. To-day things have come to such a pass in the weaving section that
                        manufacturers are more disposed to stop a few weeks than to keep machinery
                        fully employed. This state of things has been going on for a couple of
                        months or so. All this year makers of piece goods who use bought yarn have
                        been experiencing a narrower margin owing to the advancing tendency of yarn
                        at a time when the supply of cop-twist and weft has been scarcely sufficient
                        for the required consumption of the looms. Sellers of yarn have been enabled
                        to obtain full quotations. Higher raw cotton has meant higher yard prices,
                        in short, spinners have kept their margin of profit pretty well, regardless
                        of the narrowing margin of cloth producers.</p>
                    <p>The cloth demand from the great consuming markets of the East has fallen off,
                        and orders have only been obtainable in comparatively small lots at prices
                        not in keeping with yarn values. The result of it all is that to-day the
                        loom section dependable on bought yam is in a depressed state, and in
                        numerous cases it is felt that the best policy under the circumstances is to
                        lessen the consumption of yarn by stopping and also decreasing the
                        production of cloth and so relieve the market. At Whitsuntide this year,
                        when the looms are usually idle for a few days, arrangements were made in
                        Blackburn and other districts to extend the holidays several days. This did
                        not assist the market, no steps are being taken in Burnley, which is a big
                        manufacturing district, to close down a whole fortnight before the middle of
                        next month. This is looked upon as a drastic step, and it tells its own
                        tale. There are 80,000 looms in that centre, and a fortnight's stoppage
                        means a reduced consumption of yarn to the extent of nearly 8,000,OOO lb. It
                        is estimated that it would take fifty spinning mills of average size, say
                        100,000 spindles, to produce this weight in a fortnight. The Accrington
                        district, which has nearly 30,000 looms, is about to adopt some such policy
                        as has been agreed upon in Burnley. Other towns are following suit, such as
                        Bacup.</p>
                    <p>Whilst all this short time is being worked in weaving, the spinning trade is
                        folly employed on yarn contracts entered into some months ago. Spinners
                        to-day have a good margin of profit in most counts and qualities, on every
                        pound of yam they may sell. A feature is that the spinning holidays are
                        observed later on in the season. A matter of interest has been that the
                        export demand for the Continent has strengthened the position of spinners
                        lately.But for that Urge trade it is thought that spinners would have found
                        their position by now less satisfactory than a month or two ago. It almost
                        seems from what is going on, that yarn has seen its best days. There is sure
                        to be a material lessening of consumption, and on the other hand spinners
                        are bringing more yam upon the market by the gradual starting of new milLs.
                        Spinners have a more perfect organization than the weaving employers, and it
                        remains to be seen what steps the Federation of spinning employers will take
                        as to running lessened time in case the weaving short time becomes
                        widespread. It would not come as a surprise if the Federation, finding their
                        margin slipping away, stopped the spindles for a stated period. It is
                        probable that there will be a struggle between the spindles and the looms
                        during the next three or four months.</p>
                    <p>Trade generally, so far as the consumption of goods abroad is concerned, may
                        be described as healthy. The higher prices will, no doubt, restrict
                        operations, but customers abroad are on the whole doing very well, and the
                        outlook in India is not at all unsatisfactory. For a couple of months past
                        India has bought very little cloth. She possesses large supplies, but
                        dealers in Bombay and Calcutta have hesitated about following the higher
                        course of values. Then she has awaited the monsoon rains. These rains which
                        have been expected for a week past, set in at Bombay on Wednesday last, and
                        if the downpour be general in the Dependency the crops will be assured, and
                        business in piece goods with Lancashire will probably be immediately
                        resumed. China is over supplied, but the stocks there are running down.
                        Egypt and Turkey, as well as South America, take largely from us. Indeed,
                        during the last few years they have increased their imports
                        considerably.</p>
                    <p>All is uncertainty as to the probable American crop next season, which
                        commences on Aug. 1st. In the meantime there is plenty of cotton to go
                        round. If the American yield be as large as the last, then all will be well
                        for the County Palatine, but if it should prove to be a small crop, as two
                        years ago, then there will not be enough raw material to keep the spindles
                        of the world running full time.</p>

                            has mysteriously disappeared from her parents house in the Tewfikieh

                            that she mounted a motor-car at the Rond Point Tewfik, but the young
                            bey, with whom the girl had been in secret correspondence denies any

                            week, while Mrs. Bailey, a lady nurse, and Dr. Menasce were driving in
                            the night along Sharia Abbas to an urgent case of hemorrage, their
                            carriage drove into a mound of stones piled up in the middle of the
                            road. The concussion was so severe that the nurse was laid up owing to
                            the shock. A correspondent writes :—"The Esbekieh Police Station was

                        <p>The "Statist" in commenting on the crisis in Egypt, draws attention to
                            the country's great prosperity and remarks: "It is a natural result of
                            all this (prosperity) that speculation should have become rampant, that
                            new companies should have been manufactured on a rash wale, and that
                            many of the new companies should be bogus concerns. The banks, it is
                            understood, have from the first set their faces against a large number
                            of these new companies. Certain private bankers and private capitalists
                            have financed them; but the great banks, Egyptian, British and French,
                            have set their faces against them, and it is believed that they have of
                            late been putting pressure upon their customers to take insail. The
                            result is a further fall and some failures. It has been alleged that
                            some of these failures will hit Paris severely. We believe this is a
                            mistake so far as the banks are concerned, the banks as we have already
                            said, having carefully refrained from financing all sorts of unsafe new
                            companies. But it is possible, of course, that speculators in Paris may
                            have been hit, and it is also possible that private capitalists may have
                            been hit. However, so far as we can understand, the losses will fall
                            chiefly upon operators in Egypt itself. The "Daily Telegraph," of the
                            18th inst., in reviewing the state of the London Stock Exchange for the
                            week, says :—</p>
                        <p>"While only a couple of insignificant failures have taken place in the
                            Stock Exchange this week, further heavy losses, it is to be feared, have
                            been incurred by many brokers, owing to financial difficulties in Egypt,
                            which have reacted on London through Paris. For some time back trouble
                            had been looked for, as the outcome of the land and bank speculation in
                            Egypt, and its arrival should be no surprise. Apparently, however, two
                            of the official agents de change in Paris have become involved with
                            Alexandria clients, hence the recent selling of Rio Tinto, De Beers, and
                            other securities." </p>
                        <p>"The Tribune" says :—</p>
                        <p>"The situation in Egypt naturally continues to be the subject of
                            considerable discussion in financial circles. Cables received yesterday
                            from that country intimated that the difficulties were confined to the
                            bourse, and that further liquidation of speculative accounts was likely
                            to take place. The commercial position, however, is said to be sound and
                            the value of agricultural land maintained, while a large cotton crop is
                            looked for. The elimination of the weak speculative element will
                            undoubtedly prove beneficial, and if the trouble does not extend to the
                            commercial community an early recovery is not improbable."</p>

                    <p>Several complaints have been made about the ice supply of Khartoum and its
                        sister cities. The arbitrary regulations adopted for its sale, making it
                        impossible for a purchaser to buy less than a kilo, are commented upon but
                        not regarded as much of a serious grievance compared with the quality of the
                        ice itself. It is made of unfiltered water, and contains much sand and other
                        impurities—organic and inorganic. It taints the purity of the water or any
                        other beverage with which it is used ; and is regarded as a menace to the
                        public health. The suggestion is made that the ice manufacturing company
                        might, without imperilling its financial stability, invest a few pounds in
                        the purchase of zeers or filters or the installation of a filtering plant,
                        and the cause of complaint will thereby be completely removed.</p>

                    <p>The general meeting of the Suez Canal shareholders adopted the report
                        presented on behalf of the council of administration by Prince Auguste
                        d'Arenberg.</p>
                    <p>Among the British members of the council of administration present at the

                        General Sir John Ardagh, Lord Rathmore, Sir T. Sutherland, and Messrs Green
                        and Hughes. Mr. Donkin wrote regretting his absence owing to illness. M.
                        Lepine, Prefect of Police, who was appointed to the council of
                        administration, was presented to the shareholders.</p>
                    <p>Prince d'Arenberg, in addressing the meeting, surveyed the improvements
                        introduced during the last ten years. He pointed out that since 1896 upwards
                        of 36,000,000f.(£ 1,440,000) had been spent on widening and deepening the
                        Suez Canal. The fine hospital of Port Said had been enlarged, and
                        dispensaries had been established in connexion with that hospital and at
                        Ismailia and at Port Tewfik, near Suez. At these institutions upwards of
                        120,000 patients had received treatment, and more than 500,000 consultations
                        had been given. All those improvements bail been profitable, and the
                        dividends, far from diminishing, had, on the contrary, increased. Alluding
                        to the various rival canal schemes which periodically cropped up, Prince
                        d'Arenberg pointed out that the company enjoyed by treaty a monopoly canal
                        exploitation in the isthmus, and that consequently companies desirous of
                        embarking on a rival enterprise would be obliged to go through the Jordan
                        Valley, where they would encounter almost insuperable difficulties.</p>
                    <p>A shareholder asked whether the council of administration was not afraid of
                        the Panama Canal's competing to a certain extent with the Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>Prince d'Arenberg replied that very little American tonnage passed through
                        the Suez Canal. Personally be believed that the Panama Canal would not
                        affect the traffic of the Suez Canal. The more new routes were opened to
                        commerce the more would traffic be increased and the more would the company
                        profit.</p>
                    <p>On the motion of the council of administration the meeting unanimously
                        ratified the appointment of the following new members of the council: — M.

                        Considerable damage was done to the cotton crop in the Kassala by field mice
                        which ate the fresh holla or destroyed them. The crop hardly amounted to one
                        half of what was exited. Mildew has done some damage to sagia crops, mostly

                        necessarily offensive to Mohamedans, especially if they happen to be engaged

                        held on Saturday afternoon:- </p>
                    <p>Gentlemen:</p>
                    <p>You will remember that at the General Meeting of the 16th April, confirmed by
                        Meeting of the 7th May, both held in London, our Company was reconstituted
                        on its original lines, and this is therefore the first Meeting held under
                        these altered conditions though still an English Company you have no more
                        London Board.</p>
                    <p>The accounts speak, I think, for themselves, and if any further information
                        which is not contained in the report, and which I am in a position to give,
                        is asked for, I am here to reply.</p>
                    <p>As you are fully aware, as far as the property market and general financial
                        situation is concerned, Egypt is unfortunately under a cloud. Property sales
                        are very rare and encashments of monies due on sales made are very difficult
                        to obtain. A policy of waiting is absolutely imposed. This being the case,
                        it may] he asked whether we have been wise in paying out as dividend our
                        entire amount of profit realized and on this point I owe you an
                        explanation.</p>
                    <p>When we come together next year, we shall have to divide our profits among a
                        larger state holding ; though there is no intention of any public issue of
                        new capital, a convention has been entered into with Messrs. Suares Freres
                        &amp; Cie whereby 10,000 s hares (jouissance 1st April 1907) are to be
                        allotted to them in exchange for their land at Meadi and L 75,000 cash ; and
                        as we wish to be absolutely fair both to the new shareholders and the old,
                        we judged it only right to disregard the temptation of keeping monies

                    <p>Gentlemen, you all know the financial, crisis through which Egypt in common
                        with every other country in Europe and America is now going through. How
                        long the crisis will last nobody could tell; but be it short or be it long,
                        the end is bound to come and we will have a revival of confidence and active
                        dealing in building lands. By this I do not mean to say that I look forward
                        in the immediate future to a recurrence of the very high prices that were
                        paid for last year for some suburban properties: but cheap building lands
                        such as your Company holds are bound to sell at prices that will yield
                        handsome profits. A glance at our printed report will show you that we held
                        on 31st March 1907, 1,573,774 square metres of such lands costing a total
                        sum of L E. 179,061, which is equal to P.T. 11 1/2 per square metre or
                        adding 40% for roads P.T. 16 per square metre, amongst which area are
                        included 60,000 square metres situated in various parts in the towns of
                        Cairo, Tantah, etc., which even in these depressed times can be sold at an
                        average equal to a good many times that figure.</p>
                    <p>As to what has taken place since closing these accounts, the property of
                        Snares Freres &amp; Cie adjoining ours at Meadi has been secured and we are
                        already in possession. The property of Karkours has also been bought, but
                        here we are not yet in possession, as the necessary formalities are not yet
                        completed. These two purchases add another 730,000 square metres to our
                        domain at Meadi.</p>
                    <p>As to our negotiations with the Government re the road, I regret that these
                        have not gone on as satisfactorily as we could wish. Up to the present, the
                        Finance Committee having only offered a sum of L.5,000 to improve the
                        present Old Cairo road as far as Madabegh Station and this on condition that
                        the Company provides at its own cost the site, and makes the remainder of
                        the road, from Madabegh station onwards. The Public Works Department
                        themselves have assured us that the amount is entirely insufficient for the
                        purpose, so that we can only hope for a wore generous and practicable
                        response to a modified offer we are now making to the Government. It is
                        generally acknowledged that a road to Helouan is absolutely essential and
                        must be made sooner or later, and I am therefore sanguine that the
                        Government will not miss profiting by this opportunity of obtaining over 4
                        kilometres of this road made for nothing, as well as half the upkeep of a
                        further large section which this Company is rawly to guarantee. Negotiations
                        for electrifying the Cairo-Helouan Railways are well advanced and when
                        completed, our Meadi Estate will certainly be enhanced in value.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime we are building a few villa houses, which we hope to have
                        ready towards the end of the year or early in 1908, and are also developing
                        and improving your property.</p>
                    <p>I move "that the report of the directors dated 13th instant, together with
                        statement of accounts and balance sheet for the year ended 31st March 1907

                    <p>The Anglo-Belgian Company of Egypt, Ltd. has just disposed of one its few

                        square metre with very favourable conditions of payment. Coming at such a

                        excellent impression generally. It is worthy of note that the Anglo Belgian

                        suburban lots taring been recorded for some time, and the management is to

                    <head>INCREASING INFANT MORTALITY.</head>
                    <p>Some remarkable statistics are given by our Cairo contemporary "Journal du
                        Cairo' on the infant mortality of Cairo. According to this paper within a
                        quarter of a century the capital of Egypt will not contain one inhabitant.
                        Needless to say the statistics given by our contemporary are based upon the
                        figures recently given by the census and those of the statistical department
                        for births and deaths. These are possibly equally erroneous, but at any rate
                        it is obvious that the deductions of our contemporary are absolutely
                        ridiculous be the cause what it may.</p>
                    <p>Working upon the said basis the writer of the article, taking the bulletins
                        from May 25 to June 3, and from the 11th to the 17th June, finds that in the
                        former period there were 487 births and 837 deaths, and in the latter period
                        462 births and 738 deaths. According to such figures the deaths in the
                        Capital are at least 14,400 more than births, and, taking the census
                        figures, viz 640,000, it only requires 44 years to leave Cairo without a
                        single inhabitant.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Editor,—F. R. appears to be very indignant at the Jesuit
                            Fathers' conduct as regards "their notices and other impediments put up
                            on the spot from using the pool" at Cleopatra. What strikes me most in
                            the gentleman's letter is not so much the cause of his grumbling, as the
                            zeal wherewith he is animated to propagate by word and example his
                            principles of Christian charity. His weapons are inverted commas and
                            black paint. Talk of St. Paul teaching the Athenians tho mysteries of
                            the unknown God, but F. R. preaching to the Jesuits beats anything of
                            the sort. And supposing the good Fathers did listen to F. R., and took
                            pattern by him; well, I fancy, they should have, in consequence, a very
                            remarkable coating of his black paint Sir, 1 know nothing about the
                            Jesuits, or about Cleopatra and its pool, but I am inclined to think,
                            that it is not a white handkerchief that is working all the mischief in
                            the imagination of bathers. Perhaps, the pool can boast of a red rag,
                            and we all know the effect produced in the mind of those who are
                            pugnaciously inclined by such a piece of stuff. Now F.R. get a wee bit
                            hotter over the matter and the Jesuits stall, in conscience, be obliged
                            to give you a cooling in their pool ; and, furthermore, try and make up
                            your mind, ad Majorem Dei Gloriam, to get acquainted with these reverend
                            gentlemen, for theirs is pre-eminently the art of raising one's charity
                            above the freezing point and of inspiring people with tact and
                            magnanimity. And don't be shy, please.</p>

                    <p>The second meeting of the fifth season of the Alexandria Swimming Club was
                        held on Saturday afternoon. The chief events of the meeting were a team race
                        and polo match against H.M.S. "Diana." The team race, which was 420 yards,
                        each member of the teams swimming 60 yards, was very well contested, but the
                        club had got the better team together and won by a length and a half. After
                        the team race was the polo match, which the club won by 6 goals to I, hut on
                        this occasion a distinctly tatter match was witnessed, the "Diana" being
                        much stronger than on the former occasion.The "Diana's" goal keeper was
                        especially prominent and saved several difficult shots ; indeed, he was
                        responsible for reducing the score by not a few goals. The polo match was
                        followed by a 60 yards handicap between the members of the Club, which
                        brought out 14 competitors. The handicap was divided into two heats, the
                        winners of which were (I) Inglott and Liggins, and (2) Palmer and Darton.
                        The final was won easily by Inglott who came in first by about five feet,
                        hut only a touch separated second and third, who were Palmer and Liggins,
                        respectively. The Club hope to hold a water carnival next Saturday in honour
                        of the visit of the Mediterranean Fleet, which will arrive the previous

                            <p>M. Albert, unaccompanied, appeared this morning at the Ministry of
                                Inferior. M. Clemenceau sternly rebuked him pointing out the heavy
                                responsibility he incurred. M. Albert wept and asked his advice,
                                exclaiming that if he could only make reparation be would do so. M.
                                Clemenceau laconically recommended him to surrender to the
                                authorities. M. Albert left by a private door. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>M. Marcellin Albert appeared at the Ministry of the Interior. He was
                                received by M. Clemenceau, who greatly blamed his conduct. M. Albert
                                wept and asked advice. M. Clemenceau invited him to make himself
                                prisoner M. Albert promised to issue his influence for restoring
                                calm. He then left free and in the evening left for the South.

                    <head>CYPRUS. <lb/>A SUMMER RESORT FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The complaint is often made by Europeans in Egypt that one of the great
                        drawbacks of life in this country is that no change can be found in the
                        summer save what is obtainable at the cost of an expensive trip to Europe.
                        Yet only a few hours distant lies one of the most beautiful islands in the
                        Mediterranean, where all the expenses of a fortnight's visit need not exceed
                        a single, first-class fare from Alexandria to Marseilles. No more charming
                        or convenient summer resort than Cyprus can be found for those who do not
                        care to face the expense and trouble of a trip to Europe. The sea journey
                        only lasts a few hours and is invariably calm in the summer months.</p>
                    <p>The only English company leaving a frequent and regular service to Cyprus is
                        the Asia Minor Steamship Company, which dispatches a steamer from Alexandria
                        direct to Cyprus every eight day's. Only one whole day is spent at sea. The
                        ports visited by the steamer are Limassol, Larnaca and Famagusta and there
                        is time for passengers making the round trip to visit each port There is
                        also a Greek line, the Limassol Steamship Company, running between Egypt and
                        Cyprus.</p>
                    <p>The pine-clad heights of Mount Troodos, over 6,400 feet above the sea, are
                        specially adapted for a long stay, while a hurried visitor can s pend a
                        fortnight on the island, and, if he mAps out his tour, will find that in
                        scenery and antiquarian interest Cyprus can hold its own with any country on
                        the shores of the Mediterranean. The sites of its many ancient cities
                        contain little of interest except to the archeologist, and scanty are the
                        remains at Paphos and Salamis to tell of the glories of the cities of
                        Aphrodite and Pygmalion. The real charm of Cyprus is not classic but
                        romantic and medieval. The wonderful castles perched on mountain tops the
                        cathedrals and churches of the Crusaders and Lusignan Kings, the old walled
                        cities of Famagusta and Nicosia and the exquisite ruins of the Abbey of
                        Bella Pais are filled with romantic mementoes extending from the age of
                        knight errantry and Richard Coeur de Lion, to the last days of the Oriental
                        Empire of the Republic of Venice The inland Is full of natural beauties.
                        Along the northern coast the range of the Kyrenian mountains runs for over a
                        hundred miles. Although their highest summit does not much exceed 3,000
                        feet, as they rise from the level of the sea, they look of quite an imposing
                        altitude and they have all the pictures que contours of the mountains of
                        Greece. Mount Troodos, the highest summit of the southern range, is the most
                        delightful spot in the summer within a few hours journey from Egypt, and
                        further to the west lies the beautiful region of the Paphos forest There is
                        only the line of railway running from Famagusta to Nicosiaand Morphou on the
                        west coast, but the roads are excellent and perfectly adapted every where
                        for carriages. But the best node of seeing Cyprus is by means of a mule. Two
                        mules, one for the tourist the other for the mulateer and the luggage, only
                        cost 5s. per day. The country is perfectly safe to travel in and ladies can
                        contemplate a visit to Cypress without the slightest anxiety. It is possible
                        to see all the chief sights in the island in eight days, and thus a hasty
                        visit will admit of the tourist gaining a good general impression of the
                        island and being hack again in Alexandria in fortnight. Within eight days it
                        will be possible to see Famagusta and Nicosia, to ride to Kyrenia and visit
                        the castle of Saint Hilarion and the abbey of Bella Pais, to make a days
                        excursion to the castle of Buffavento and to ride to Troodos and thence to
                        Nicosia.</p>
                    <p>A fortnight's trip on the Island will enable the tourist to visit the castle
                        of Kautara from Famagusta, and to stay two days at the beautifully situated
                        monastery of Kykko, which will enable him to make a day's excursion to the
                        Paphos forest while the time that remains before embarkation can be well
                        spent on Mount Troodos.</p>
                    <p>HOTELS IN CYPRUS.</p>
                    <p>The hotels in Cyprus have much improved during the last few years and the
                        accommodation is on the whole very fair, while they are generally dean and
                        well kept, although they are, of course, of modest dimensions and cannot be
                        compared with Egypt. The charges are moderate and the cost for full board
                        and lodging, with the exception of Mount Troodos which has only a summer
                        season, average about 6s per day. Even at Troodos for a long stay married
                        couple can lie accommodated for 6s. 6d. a day or £10 per month.</p>
                    <p>There is excellent accommodation at Troodos for visitors. Mr. Najem Houry,
                        the Army contractor, opened the Mount Olympus Hotel last year. It is
                        beautifully situated and commands a magnificent view of the north of Cyprus.
                        the hotel has twenty-two bedrooms, but tourists, who prefer, can be lodged
                        in tents, which is a favourite mode of living on the mountain. The hotel is
                        very comfortable and scrupulously clean and the charges for full board are
                        from 6s. to 10s. per day. For long stays there are special terms. This is
                        the only hotel on the mountain, but Miss Young, an English lady from
                        Nicosia, accommodates visitors in her camp doling the summer months under
                        canvas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Najem Houry also owns the Savoy Hotel at Famagusta It is situated on
                        rising ground over looking the sea and is near the English Club and the
                        Railway Station. It only patronized by Europeans and is quite comfortable
                        Visitors landing at Famagusta, Larnaca or Limassol can have all their
                        arrangements for a trip to Troodos made through Mr. Najem Houry. The
                        Armenian Hotel at Nicosia is a well managed establishment and the
                        proprietor, Mr. George Sultanian, is most obliging and has a large English
                        clientele. At Limassol there are two hotels, the Britannia Hotel, belonging
                        to Mr. Selim Houry, and the Troodos Hotel, which is the property Mr. Nikola
                        Cyprioti. The Royal Hotel at Larnaca is also a comfortable establishment.
                        One of the places in the island, which all tourists should visit, is Kyrenia
                        owing to its proximity to the magnificent remains of the Castle of Saint
                        Hilarion and the monastery of Bella Pais. A new hotel, the Akteon, has
                        lately been built there. It is right on the sea and has a bathing
                        establishment attached.</p>

                    <head>BAHR EL GHAZAL</head>
                    <p>The "Sudan Times" gives the following gist of an interview with a gentleman
                        who has been in Bahr el Ghazal, ament the conditions of that vast
                        province:</p>
                    <p>"Though nearer the equator than Khartom, the heat there is not more intense,
                        and the nights are always cool, sometimes cold. The country is thickly
                        wooded and the ground is covered with grass. The atmosphere therefore deer
                        on account of the absence of dust.</p>
                    <p>The rainy season lasts about 8 months, during which, though the rain falls at
                        frequent intervals it rarely lasts more than one or two hours. During the
                        dry season, the ground remains covered with green grass.</p>
                    <p>The soil is suitable for the cultivation of all products that are raised in
                        other parts of the country. Vegetables, such as potatoes, tomatoes, beans,
                        peas, etc, have been tried and thrived admirably. Sugar cane and bananas, if
                        cultivated there, may become profitable industries.</p>
                    <p>Cotton may be successfully planted.Several plants were seen, probably
                        descended from seeds brought during the former occupation of the country by
                        the Government. The staple</p>
                    <p>short, but the bolls are as soft os silk, and if proper care is taken, there
                        is every reason to believe that cotton can be cultivated with profit
                        especially as no artificial irrigation is required, the rainy season of
                        eight mouths being amply sufficient.</p>
                    <p>The climate is not bad. A fair attention to the plain rules of health enables
                        one to avoid any serious illness. Indeed one may live there several years
                        without contracting any sickness. Among the most efficient means for
                        preserving good health are daily warm baths and physical exercise or manual
                        labour. Tiresome labour, however, should be avoided during the hottest part
                        of the day, or in the sun. The weather changes suddenly and precautions must
                        lie taken against the sudden changes.</p>
                    <p>The natives are usually strongly built Their muscles are well-developed like
                        those of athletes. This is attributed mainly to their simple mode of life
                        and their indulgence in dancing. To most of the men, this is the only form
                        of exercise they have, as they do no bodily labour, relegating the
                        cultivation on the fields and the carrying of burdens and similar hard work
                        to the women.</p>
                    <p>Malaria is prevalent in the swamps, but is rather scarce in Meridi and its
                        neighbourhood. Gigger worms are perhaps the worst pest; but they can be
                        easily avoided by cleanliness and by never walking barefooted.</p>
                    <p>The main obstacles in the way of the development of those regions at present
                        are due to the difficulty of communications and the absence of good roads.
                        But the efforts that the Government is putting forth to improve the roads
                        raise the hopes that before long that part of the Sudan will not be behind
                        the rest of the country in its march towards civilization and
                        prosperity.</p>

                    <p>An important step forward in the campaign against sleeping sickness has been
                        taken by the British Colonial Office in convening a conference of the
                        various African colonies and protectorates interested, to discuss
                        international measures for dealing with this dread scourge. the first
                        meeting took place at the Foreign Office last week, when the delegates were
                        as follows Great Britain, Lord Fitz maurice, who has been elected president.
                        Sir W. Foster, Mr. A.W. Clarke, Foreign Office, Mr. H. J. Read, Colonial
                        Office, and Sir Patrick Man son; Sudan, Colonel Hunter and Dr. Balfour, of
                        the Garden College, Khartum Germany, Herr von Jacobs, of the Imperial
                        Colonial Office, Dr. Ehrlich and Dr. Fulleborn Congo Free State, Colonel
                        Lantonnais, Vice Governor General, Commandant Tonneau, M, Rotten, and Dr.

                        Blanchard, and Dr. Laveran; and Portugal, Dr. Correa Pinto.</p>
                    <p>The work before the conference includes the question of the bolding of
                        regular conferences, the establishment of a central bureau of information,
                        the assignment of definite points for investigation to particular countries
                        or individuals. In the case of Uganda, Mr. Hesketh Bell, his Majesty's
                        Commissioner for the Protectorate, has prepared a scheme for dealing with
                        the scourge in his Protectorate. The main features of the scheme are the
                        deportation of the population from the infected lake shore and the
                        segregation of the sick in a number of large camps, where they can be
                        treated by atoxyl or other drugs which give hope for success.</p>
