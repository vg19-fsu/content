                            2s.6d. He adds that he was induced to make the purchase by a circular,
                            issued by the directors, which spoke in glowing terms of the property,
                            and foreshadowed the formation of a company to develop it. So far as he

                            carotid artery, and his assailant immediately took to his heels. Up to
                            the time of writing he had not been arrested. The wounded man was
                            conveyed to the Italian hospital but refused to divulge his

                            affairs to a neighbouring village. As Prince Kamel El Din wished to

                            his estate he gave orders to have the huts in the village removed. As

                        by the two Powers on April 8th, 1904, has been violated. But it is
                        considered that its spirit has been disregarded in the appointment of Mr.
                        Hill as the successor of M. Lambert, Professor of the French University, and

                        no clause which prohibits the appointment of an Englishman in the place of
                        M. Lambert, but Clanse 5 contains dispositions favourable to the Frenchmen
                        in the employ of the Egyptian Government. It indeed says: "The Government of
                        his Britannio Majesty will use its influence in order that the French
                        functionaries in the service of Egypt be not placed under less advantageous
                        conditions than those applied to English functionaries in the same service." </p>
                    <p>Of course, there is nothing in that phrase which prohibits the nomination of
                        Mr. Hill, and Clause 1 of the 1904 agreement only mentions one post-that of
                        the directorship of the Service of Antiquities - as being left definitively
                        in the possession of a Frenchman. However, if Mr. Hill's appointment is
                        correct in accord with the letter of the 1904 arrangement, it is regarded by
                        the French Government as not being in accord with its spirit. In that
                        arrangement France undertook "not to hamper the action of England in Egypt
                        by demanding that a term be fixed to the British oconpation, or by any other
                        means. But, on the other hand, the French were promised every guarantee for
                        the maintenance and de. velopment of their economic and moral influence-that
                        is to say, of their commerce and schools. </p>
                    <p>It is thought in Paris that perhaps the present incident is due to what is
                        regarded as the anti-French training which Lord Cromer gave his
                        subordinates, and which was at the time quite legitimate, because it was
                        previous to the signature of the understanding with France. After the
                        reconciliation the chiefs of the two Governments adapted their conduct to
                        the new state of things. But certain subordinates--and Mr. Dunlop is
                        classified among them-have been unable to divest themselves of their old
                        habits. </p>
                    <p>The correspondent of the "Temps" in London telegraphs to that journal that he
                        has been told at the Foreign Office that nothing is known there about the
                        nomination of Mr. Hill as successor of M. Lambert at the Khedival Law
                        School. Matters of that kind are left to the Egyptian authorities. The
                        official at the Foreign Office who received the "Temps" correspondent,
                        however, assured him that the nomination of Mr. Hill should not be regarded
                        as a question of nationality, but as a question of personality.</p>

                    <p>Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Connaught was present at Burlington House,
                        Piecadilly, last week and opened the Exhibition of Antiquities discovered at
                        Abydos, Upper Egypt, during the past season by Professor Garstang, Mr. E.
                        Harold Jones, and the Hon. R. H. Trefusis, in connection with the Institute
                        of Archaeology, University of Liverpool. Her Royal Highness was received by
                        Lady Alice Stanley on behalf of the Abydos Excavations Committee. Professor
                        Garstang is at present engaged in exploration work in Asia Minor, and was
                        unfortunately unable to be present. The past season has not been productive
                        of any epoch-making discovery, but the fine collection of scarabs,
                        ornaments, and inscriptions dating from 2,000 to 1,200 B.C., and of stel of
                        Ptolemaic and later dates is well worthy of a visit by all interested in
                        Egyptology. The collection, which has been carefully arranged and
                        classified, has for other features a little Jivory seal representing a child
                        with his hand to his face, and a wooden statuette of a woman and child-both
                        of the Twelfth Dynasty-a bronze battleaxe, and a most interesting array of
                        articles of the toilet table of 4,000 years ago, including combs, hairpins,
                        and kohl (antimony) jars, and a fearsome razor, which throws a lurid light
                        on the martyrdom of early man. The exhibition remains open from to-day until
                        the end of the month, and, with those running concurrently at King's College
                        and University College, provides a conspectus of the results of British
                        exploration work in Egypt during the past winter. </p>

                    <head>THE VIVANTE MYSTERY. THE NEW THEORY. </head>
                    <p>The detectives of the Alexandria City Police have adopted a new theory to the
                        case of the mysterious murder of Mr. Vivante. It was obvious that after the
                        two arrests of the Spaniard and the German, it was necessary to discover a
                        fresh train of circumstances as hitherto all the efforts of the police have
                        resulted in their suspicions falling on persons whom they could not prove to
                        have been connected with the crime. We understand that the police are now
                        convinced that the murderer had powerful private motives for killing Mr.
                        Vivante. </p>
                    <p>The theory of an attempted robbery is no longer held. They believe that
                        whoever it was who committed the crime, was urged to the desperate deed by
                        the strongest inducements and that consequently the crime was no mere vulgar
                        affair of theft leading to the victim's death, but, on the contrary, was the
                        inevitable outcome of a series of incidents, owing to the relation of the
                        assassin with his victim. The murderer was so determined to remove Mr.
                        Vivante from the world of the living that he had the astounding andacity to
                        commit the crime in a room separated only by a partition wall from the bed
                        chamber occupied by another man. His motives were so strong that they
                        impelled him to a crime, which could only be executed against huge odds
                        against its perpetrator being undetected. As it happens, the murderer
                        escaped by a miracle, but his escape only lends additional interest to the
                        desperate fool hardiness of the crime. </p>

                    <p>I was most impressed on entering Paris by its splendid cafes which abound
                        with loose women, and where there is a remarkable lack of bashfulness on the

                        superficial European progress does not de grade" public morality and public
                        virtues to one-tenth of its depth in Paris. I happened to sit in one of the
                        Parisian cafés, but was all the time ocoupied by conflicting thoughts
                        regarding the relations between man and woman in this civilized country and
                        how each bebeves towards the other ? Adnltery in Egypt is not so flagrant in

                    <head>ENGLISH INFLUENCE IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>In an interesting lecture on the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund at Deir
                        el-Bahari, at King's College last week, Mr. C. J. Currelly said the original
                        temple of the Eleventh Dynasty was erected for man and for man's
                        glorification, and it was put up during a reign of tyranny in Egypt. The
                        Egyptian had always | been dominated by a governing influence. To| day, if
                        the English influence were withdrawn, the Egyptian would soon revert to his
                        original inactive condition. They wonld still find evidence of the primitive
                        man there. So long as the Egyptian could be driven be seemed to be capable
                        of almost anything, but when the pressure was withdrawn he fell back to the
                        primi. tive ways. Mr. Currelly observed that the year's work had been one of

                                the mistakes into which inexperience led the Japanese in 1894 and

                                with which Socialism can be fought. They urge the Moderate Liberals
                                to combine with the Conservatives in the fight against the peril.
                                The Liberal papers say that the tariff reform has sustained a
                                crushing defeat and that there is nothing inconsistent with
                                Progressive Liberalism and the practical applications of

                    <head>AN EGYPTIAN IN LONDON. <lb/> 6,000 YEARS AT MEMPHIS. </head>
                    <p>Professors Flinders Petrie, the eininen Egyptologist, contributes the
                        following pap to the "Evening News" describing the ir I portant enterprise
                        which the British School Arcbæology have in hand in Egypt in th excavation
                        of the onoe populous city of Men phis. The exhibition of this season's work
                        b the Egypt Exploration Fund is now opens King's College </p>
                    <p>The Londoner is apt to think that his "pro vince covered with houses" is the
                        greatest cit that ever has been; but the old capital Egypt was probably a
                        close rival to it. Even i the Roman age, which was by no means th most
                        flourishing time of Memphis, the cit extended over a space of gronnd as
                        large as al London north of the Thames, from Hammer smith to the river Les,
                        and from the Thame up to Highgate. </p>
                    <p>So it may well bave rivalled all London when in its príme. </p>
                    <p>It is described as having a circuit of abou twenty-five miles, and by the
                        form of the ground we can see that this site had a length of about nine or
                        ten miles, and a breadth o about three miles. </p>
                    <p>This great city gradually decayed with the growth of Alexandria ; and the
                        rise of the mud of the Nile inundation has covered all but the central
                        parts. The old level of the foundation age is now more than 20ft. beneath
                        the ploughed fields which form the present ground. </p>
                    <p>In the midst of this past hive of activity there are a few mounds around the
                        central site of the great temples. And it is on these temples that the
                        British School of Archæology in Egypt is now going to put the main strength
                        of what England will do for such research. To </p>
                    <p>lear down to the bottom of the remaining mounds of the city is more than we
                        dare to look forward to doing ; the thonsand acres or Bo would cost a
                        quarter or half a million sterling to exhaust. But the temple sites might be
                        searched within about a hundred acres of learance, and £50,000 might perhaps
                        be raised n the course of some years for such a purpose. </p>
                    <p>About a twentieth of a farthing in the pound on the drink bill wonld do it
                        handomely. </p>
                    <p>Other countries take up such enterprises as national affairs. France has
                        spent about this monnt on clearing the temples and buildings </p>
                    <p>t Delphi ; Germany likewise cleared up Olympia and Pergamon. We have now in
                        our mands a site as important as these, and it will me our duty to show that
                        we can make use of uch an opportunity... The Temple of Ptah. </p>
                    <p>The temple of Ptah, the greatest god of emphis, was a vast and rich
                        structure, which was successively added to by all the great ulers. Even in
                        the scanty times of Herodotus we read of five porticoes covered with
                        sculpmures belonging to various ages, from the Pyramid times down to the
                        Greek period. </p>
                    <p>It was doubtless on the same scale as the mmense temple of Karnak at the
                        southern apital, and was, like that, crowded with tatues. We read of six
                        colossal figures before me gate. And though all the walls have een carried
                        away for building material in the Tiddle Ages, yet the statuary and the
                        foundtiong of many successive rebuildings remain eneath those fields. </p>
                    <p>At Abydos the foundations of ten successive emples were found, one beneath
                        another, and much the same may be looked for at Memphis, om the days of
                        Menes, the founder of the onaroby, through about 6,000 years, till the
                        apitulation of the Roman Governor to the rab invaders. </p>
                    <p>What we may expect to find will be blocks Esculpture, inscribed records on
                        stone slabs, ronze temple furniture, and, above all,statuary F the Memphite
                        school, which was the finest work in Egypt. There were also several other
                        emples in the heart of the city, those of Isis, </p>
                    <p>Sekhet, of Neith, of Imhotep, of the Cabri, Sebek, and, above all, in its
                        interest for us, I ould be the temple of the foreign Venus, the entre of the
                        quarters occupied by the hænicians and all the traders of the Medi. rranean.
                        Jd Greek Settlere. </p>
                    <p>There we ought to find the vases, the or aments, and the art of the old Greek
                        settlers, whom Herodotas had a glimpse in his tales Menelans and Helen and
                        the heroes of the rojan war. The enclosure was described by m as very
                        beautiful and richly adorned ; and ne remains of such a centre might give
                        many ew ideas about the course of European civilation. </p>
                    <p>The School of Archæology has shown by the esent exhibition, open during this
                        month at niversity College, Gower Street, how sucssful carefully directed
                        work may be, and it mains with the British public to enable this eat
                        enterprise at Memphis to be properly rried ont, and thus enrich our museums
                        Eth the art of the great metropolis of Egypt. he seoretary of the British
                        School at Uniersity College supplies the publications to all zbscribers, and
                        thus the results of every Bar's work are placed in the hands of the blio.

                    <p>Mr. W.J. Moore, 11, Pakefield-street, Pak field, Lowestoft, England, is well
                        known ar respected. Although only 25 years of age, 1 has been connected with
                        religious work fe many years, and on most Sendays during th past 6 years he
                        has ably ocoupied some vi lage pulpit. </p>
                    <p>Some months back Mr. Moore wrote us grateful letter, telling of the good Doan
                        Backache Kidney Pills had done bim, and in viting us to send our
                        representative to get fu! particulars. This we have now done, and ou readers
                        will see that the case teems with interest : </p>
                    <p>"It was when the electric tramway wa being laid in Lowestoft, Mr. Moore began
                        "and I was at the wharf getting a load of ce ment, when suddenly and without
                        warning several tons of cement slipped, and before ! knew what had happened,
                        a bag struck me glancing blow on the back. It was the worst pain I've ever
                        known, just as though my back was broken in two. They took me to the hos
                        pital, where for 27 weeks I lay hovering be tween life and death. The doctor
                        said my kidneys were bruised, and at length he gave up my case as hopeless,
                        and I was taken home </p>
                    <p>"Not one of my friends thought I could live "The pains I suffered in my back
                        and hips were just as though you took out your pocket-kuife and kept
                        sticking the blade into me. I used to get dizzy and exhausted with the
                        pains, and 1 Bufferred agonies from rheamatism, as well as gravel and
                        urinary trouble. I plastered my back until it was green, but no reliet could
                        I get, and at last I became so weak with the Donstant suffering that I
                        couldn't keep down a morsel of food. A watery swelling came about my eyes,
                        and for a fortnight I couldn't see. </p>
                    <p>"I told you in my letter," Mr. Moore went on "how Doan's Backache Kidney
                        Pills did me good from the start, and now they have, hank Providence, cured
                        me, and I'm glad to mave the opportunity of endorsing my letter with my own
                        lips. Doan's Pills have made me ny old self again, and I'm as well to-day as
                        ver I was ; there's no pain or urinary trouble t all. I'm so well, in fact,
                        that for some time 've been regularly following my new occupaGion as

                    <p>"I have recommended Doan's Pills to several eople," Mr. Moore concluded, "but
