                    <p>Ahmed Fairi Pasha has given his Imperial master an accession day present that
                        will be prised by none more highly than by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The
                        veteran general, for Ahmed Faizi has over forty years service behind him,
                        appears to have accomplished very remarkable fest of arms. Leaving Bagdad in
                        November, 1904, for the Nejd, that little koown ossis in Central Arabis
                        where the Shammar ruler and Turkish protegé, Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid, was
                        struggling against the Wahabis under Abdul Aziz ibn Sa'ad and the forces of
                        the energetic Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, Ahmed Faini did not indeed arrive in
                        time to help the Shammar Emir to defest his foes, bat, with a diplomatic
                        appreciation of the needs of the position, appeared with a strong force in
                        time to save the beaten Emir from utter overthrow, and to sign a treaty with
                        the hambled chief. Hearing of the Yemen rising and its attendant reverses
                        Ahmed Faizi forthwith struck westward. He crossed long longues of desert,
                        his troops suffered bruelly from heat and thirst, the Bedonin were hostile,
                        but the old general car <cb n="6"/>ried his army with little loss to Medina,
                        marched thence to Mecos, whare the discontented were openly speaking of an
                        Arab Caliphate, and after detaching part of his army to hold back the rebets
                        in the province of Azir, took ship, as generalissimo of the Osmanli forces,
                        to Hodeida Weeks passed there, ia the terrible heat of the Tehama, while the
                        Turkish armies prepared for their counter stroke. The Arab regiments were
                        removed from the fighting line; Albanians, Lazes and Anatolian Tarks
                        replaced the mea, who were overthrown in the mountain passes last April, and
                        fresh transport and supply columns were organised. Late in July the march to
                        Sana' began. This time there was no attempt to hurry matters. Pushing slowly
                        and methodically forward Ahmed Faizi Pasha and his lieutenants won back
                        Menakha. Fresh reinforcements brought them up to Sak el Khamis, and little
                        by little the victorious armies won their way through the passes till on
                        September 1-so the Imperial Ottoman Agency reports, although Reuter is
                        silent on the matter,-the capital of the rebellious province was once again
                        in the Sultan's power.</p>
                    <p>The Turkish losses in the campaign were no doubt heavy. Ahmed Faizi Pasha is
                        vague in some of his despatches, while in others he announces in the true
                        Krugerian manner, that only one burgher-pardon ! we should have said
                        "soldier"-was killed and one wounded. But perhaps the conspirators, who are
                        believed by the credulous Osmanli to swarm in Syria and Egypt, would have
                        promptly informed the Imam Yehia by wireless telegraphy had the Turkish
                        losses been reported to be severe. In any case Ahmed Faizi Pasha has shown
                        once more that the "sick man" is strong enough to discomfort many of these
                        who seek to profit by his supposed infirmity, and that the Turkish soldier
                        in good hands can be trusted to go anywhere and do anything. The successful
                        veteran will no doubt be rewarded by the gift of a palace so near Yildiz
                        Kiosk that he will be able to state with literal truth that his every notion
                        is surveyed by the approving if vigilant gaze of his august and Imperial
                        master. The other protagonist of the struggle, the Imam Yahya, has retired
                        to the inaccessible interior of the Yemen, ready no doubt to issue forth
                        again, should the Turkish armies which have reoccupied the province be too
                        rapidly reduced. That the complete pacification of the Yemen will follow the
                        victories of Ahmed Faizi seems to us most improbable, but the all-important
                        Hedjaz and the Azir province are safe and the Zaidi schismatics of the Yemen
                        will doubtless feel the weight of the iron band of the Padiahah. Since the
                        reconquest of the Hauran, the Turks have faced no more obstinate foe than
                        the Imam of the Yemen,and unless he be slain or captured, (which amounts to
                        the same thing for his shrift will be a short one) he may yet give sore
                        trouble to many Turkish Generals Bat the wild dream of an Arab Caliphate is
                        dispelled, and the Tark has once. more proved that his persistency and
                        dogged courage, though they may not avert the calamitous consequences of
                        misgovernment and negligence, can be trusted to repair them against any
                        Oriental foe.</p>

                    <p>A return of all sums paid in 1903-4 and 1901-5 out of the revenues of Cyprus
                        for interest on the Turkish loan of 1855,guaranteed by the United Kingdom
                        and France, and other matters relating to the island has been published as a
                        House of Commons paper (281). It shows that in each of the above years
                        £81,752 118. 2d. was used for the service of the loan of 1855. In 1903-4
                        £87,000 was voted by Parliament in aid of the administration of Cyprus, but
                        no such vote was needed in the following year. The surplus remaining in each
                        year over and above the payments made with interest thereon was £16,903 3s.
                        7d. in 1903-4 and £16,915 58. 10d. in 1904-5. These surpluses have been
                        invested in Consols, as also the interest on them; the Consols so purchased
                        amounted on March 31 last to £272,891 28. 4d.</p>

                    <head>SUGAR TRADE SENSATION. M. CRONIER'S TRAGIC SUICIDE.</head>
                    <byline>(From our own Correspondent).</byline>
                    <p>London, August 29.</p>
                    <p>The European bonnes and the London 8tock Exchange were yesterday staggered by
                        the sensational news of the sadden death of M. Cronier, the great sugar
                        magnate. The effect was felt more especially on the Paris and Hamburg
                        bonnes, where the chief dealings in sugar shares take place.</p>
                    <p>M. Ernest Cronier, Ingenieur Principal do Ponts et Chviriee, Officier de la
                        Legion d'hon-nenr, had enormous commitments in sugar, which, according to
                        report, showed differences of over £2,000,000. The exact amount of the
                        losses cannot be ascertained, however, until his accounts have been
                        liquidated, so that the above figures must be accepted with reserve.</p>
                    <p>M. Cronier has for years been more or less connected with the sugar interests
                        of Egypt and Egyptian finance. In 1892 he formed the societe Generale des
                        Sucreries et de la Raffi-nerio d'Egypte in conjuction with Messieurs'
                        Suares, and at the time of his death he was president of the company. Not
                        only was be president, but he was the ruling spirit of the concern. The
                        interests of both the Say and Suares families came under the direct control
                        of this very strong-willed man, who, like Langrand Dumonean in the sixties
                        and Bon-teux in the seventies, dealt with all his companies as if they wore
                        branches of his own estates. </p>
                    <p>In 1898 he, in conjunction with Sir Ernest Cassel, Messieurs Sanies and
                        Cattani, purchased the Daira Sanieh estates from the Egyptian Government,
                        and in 1902 he bought from the Daira Sanieh administration the various sugar
                        factories for nearly £1,000,000 sterling. In order to carry out the
                        financing of this operation the Daira Sanieh Sugar Corporation was founded
                        with a total share and debenture c vital of £1,573,000, and was the go
                        between of the Daira Sanieh and the sucreries et Raffinerie Co.</p>
                    <p>The tragic suicide of M. Cronier (it appears he shot himself with a revolver
                        at his dwelling in the Rue de Lisbonne, Paris), caused a heavy fall in the
                        sugar shares on the Paris bourse. The Say Company's stock fell from 950
                        francs to 580 frances, and that of the Sucreries Raffinerie d'Egypt from 152
                        francs to 107 francs ; and although it is early yet to obtain accurate
                        information, there seems to be an opinion that this tragic event will
                        involve some form of reorganisation of the latter company. Daira Sanieh
                        deferred shares have also reacted several points and leave off this
                        afternoon at 178.</p>

                    <p>The Mauled of St. George at Mit Damsis, Dakahlieh was largely attended by the

                        cafes and kiosques were erected on the decks of barges and dahabiehs. In
                        spite of the numerous delays at the locks and bridges great number of people
                        visited the mouled by river and canal. A journey that should take ten hours
                        was only performed in forty five, so many wore the halts on the way.</p>

                        west of the English contingent, the two Russian professors from St.
                        Petersburg had placed themselves. These scientists like wise used a large
                        reflecting telescope in connection with a very fine camera, and they
                        succeeding in obtaining four photographic records. The Russians had set op a
                        magnetic observation camp on the west bank of the Nile near Grenvell's tombs
                        and on the west side of the island the American observers had up their posts
                        under Professor Hussey of the Lick Observatory, and Professor West of the
                        American College at Beyrout. The members of this commission had erected two
                        cameras, one of. enormous length measuring forty feet With this instrument
                        Professor Hussey obtained ten exposures, which varied from half a second to
                        ten seconds, and one of sixty-four seconds. The second instrument consisted
                        of four lenses in one camera, so that four photographs might be taken of the
                        corona at the same time and at different parts; with this instrument eight
                        exposures were made. Here also Dr. Myer of Germany had set up a small but
                        powerful telescope, which bad been made by the great German optician, Carl
                        Leiss of Jena, and the lens of his camera was very rapid, the longest
                        exposure with this instrument being only ten seconds. Dr. Myer, who made ten
                        exposures, chiefly interested himself in photographing the extreme edge of
                        the corona.</p>
                    <p>At the railway station Mr. J. H. Reynolds of Birmingham had erected a huge
                        reflecting telescope 120 feet long. There were great difficulties in
                        erecting this instrument, but thanks to the kindness of the railway
                        authorities, it was eventually placed in position. Mr. Reynolds secured two
                        exposures. One incident occured which might have had a disastrous effect. As
                        the total eclipse was approaching, the train from Luxor was seen to be
                        coming in the distance, but loud and continued shooting happily succeeded in
                        bring-ing the train to standstill outside Assouan station, and a great
                        dilemma was averted.</p>
                    <p>Three magnetic stations had bean erected by the Egyptian Government, one at
                        Assouan station under Mr. Wade, another at Dakka, 70 miles south, another at
                        Edfu, 70 miles north.</p>
                    <p>The total eclipse started as follows, from Winnipeg Lake across the Atlantic
                        ocean to to Spain, then through the Balearic Isles, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli,
                        Egypt, across the Red Sea, and ended in the south east of Arabia. The total
                        eclipse rone measured two degrees, and the longest time daring which it was
                        visible was at Burgos in Spain, where it lasted for about three minutes.</p>
                    <p>Most of the astronomers busied themselves with taking photographs of the
                        sun's corona, and doubtless when they have returned to their respective
                        countries, developed their photographs, and made their measurements, they
                        will give the scientific results to the world. Many of the professors were
                        in gnat hopes that at this eclipse, some new planet might be discovered, but
                        for this result we must wait with patience. In Egypt very few spectroscopic
                        observations were taken. Two perfectly constructed spectroscopes had been
                        made by Zeiss for the Spanish government, one of them to be used at Burgos
                        in an observatory, the other to be used from a balloon. The day here dawned
                        quite clear, not a vestige of a cloud was to be seen any where, and all the
                        astronomers were early astir, fingering their instruments lovingly, and
                        having full dress rehearsals. In the morning about thirty people turned up
                        to view the eclipse, and at lunch time, one might have imagined the season
                        had already begun. The first contact took place at 3 h. 26 m. p.m. exactly,
                        and all were at their respective stations. The roof of the hotel was crowded
                        with people, and the natives on the bank of the river beat furiously on
                        tom-toms. Totality commenced at 4 h. 33 m. 6 secs, but fifteen minutes
                        before this it had began to get quite dark, and the conditions reminded one
                        exactly of twilight Just before the totality began, the shadow of the moon
                        was seen moving across the hills on the east bank ; in an instant the sun
                        was obscured, and the rays of the corona shot out from all sides, one
                        extremely long stream being seen low down on the left Totality lasted
                        exactly two minutes twenty four seconds; directly the sun reappeared the
                        natives beat their tom-toms more furiously than ever, and cries of delight
                        were heard on all sides.</p>
                    <p>The eclipse was a groat success ; no clouds, rendered observation difficult
                        though it was a little hazy. The corona sphere was brilliant and at least
                        two well-marked prominences, were seen. The outer corona was very faint,
                        considering that sun spots were at their maximum. There is much speculation
                        as to whether the largest streamers can be associated with the sun spots,
                        but this is moat difficult to ascertain by a momentary glance.</p>
                    <p>The longest streamer may have been over a sun spot, which has been recently
                        visible. The stars were distinctly visible, also the planet Mars, but
                        Mercury was not seen. The largest streamer noticed was about two diameters
                        of the sun in size. During the whole eclipse the wind was hardly noticeable,
                        and the temperature seemed to drop considerably.</p>
                    <p>Professor Turner and his colleagues wish to thank Captain Lyons and all the
                        other members of the Survey Department for their kind help, without which
                        they could not have secured such success. They are also exceedingly grateful
                        to the Railway Administration for the advantages granted them, and to Mr.
                        Hazel, of the Ministry of the Interior, for the excellent way in which the
                        grounds of the hotel ware policed. Mr. Reynolds alto wishes to express his
                        thanks to Mr. Kieling for his invaluable assistance. Last, but not least,
                        all the astronomers are unanimous in expressing their satisfaction at the
                        way in which the Savoy Hotel placed everything at their disposal; the
                        basement was turned into a dark room, the garden into an observatory, and on
                        the day of the eclipse they stopped their steam water pump from working.</p>

                        <head>KHEDIVIAL YACHT CLUB.<lb/>THE ABOUKIR RACE.</head>
                        <p>One of the most popular races of the season took place yesterday. The
                            course was to Aboukir, (round "Nelson's Island") and back, a total
                            distance of nearly 50 miles, constituting the longest open sea race that
                            baa ever been bald under the auspices of the Yacht Club.</p>
                        <p>Eight boats started at 10.30 a.m. from the Club House at Ras el Tin, and
                            presented a very pretty spectacle as they all crossed the line together.
                            Six of them finished ; of the other two, Leman returned, as, being a
                            small boat, she was unable to do the distance in the heavy sea which was
                            running. The other boat, Jenny, apparently bad enough of the run down
                            and dropped anchor in the shelter of Aboukir Bay to wait a more
                            favorable opportunity of returning to Alexandria. The order of the six
                            arrivals was as follows.</p>
                        <p>Although the boats finished in the above order, the Ironie won the
                            handsome cup given by his Highness Prince Aziz on her time allowance, as
                            will be seen by consulting the handicap published in lest Saturday's
                            "Gazette."</p>
                        <p>The Beltia sailed the wrong course so that her time cannot be taken as
                            indicating her speed.</p>
                        <p>The handicap was a very good one, the difference between the Ironie and
                            Tantah being only 11 minutes, and between the Tantah and Masr 40 seconds
                            only, on the 8 hours course.</p>
                        <p>The speed of the Masr, the first boat in, averaged about 8 knots, which
                            is exceedingly fast for a boat of her type and size, and would be beaten
                            with difficulty if at all by a European built boat of the same rating,
                            and great credit to due to the native builder.</p>
                        <p>After the race Prince Asia was "at home" to the Club members. Lady
                            Blomfield kindly presented the prise to the winner.</p>
                        <p>The race is a record one in every way inasmuch as throughout the whole of
                            the long distance and amongst all the boats not a single accident of any
                            kind occurred ; all the boats reaching port safely. Snob a contingency
                            was, however, carefully provided against by the kind offer of a tug boat
                            to follow the race by Admiral Blomfield, the posting of one of Prince
                            Aziz boats at Aboukir itself, and the loan by Mr. Sergeant of an ample
                            number of life belts, so that no one in the race was without one.</p>
