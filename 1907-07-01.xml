                    <head>CONTRABAND OF WAR </head>
                    <p>One of the most important questions raised by the Hague Conference now
                        sitting, is that of contraband of war at sea, which, according to Reuter's
                        telegram of the 87th ult., the British delegates have proposed to abolish.
                        The definition of contraband, originating from the, Latin <hi rend="italic"
                            >contra bannnm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bandnm</hi> (in defiance of an
                        injunction), is always controverjihle. An excellent treatise on
                        "Interna­tional Law" by L. Oppenheim LL.D. (Longmans, -Green and Co.) says
                        (—"Contraband of war is the designation of such goods as are interdicted By
                        either belligerent to be carried to the enemy on the ground that they enable
                        the latter to carry on the war'with greater vigour." Can absolute contraband
                        be restricted to arms and ammunition only and exclu­sively } No. For the
                        fact must be taken into consideration that other articles, although of
                        anticipitous use, may be as valuable and essential to a belligerent for the
                        continuance of war as arms and ammunition. Take, for instance, the necessary
                        machinery and material for the manufacture of arms and ammunition, which are
                        almost as valuable as the latter themselves. Referring again to
                        Dr.Oppenheim's treatise on "International haw", we read that "according to
                        British practice-subject, how­ever, to the prerogative of the Crown to order
                        alterations of the list during a war—the follow­ing articles are considered
                        absolute contra­band:— Arms of all kinds and machinery for manufacturing
                        arms; ammunition and materials for ammunition, including lead sul­phate of
                        potash, muriate of potash (chloride.of potassium); chlorate of potash, and
                        nitrate of soda; gun powder and its materials, saltpetre and brimstone, also
                        gun cotton; militaryequipments and clothing; military stores; naval stores,
                        such as masts spare, rudders, ship timbers, hempand cordage, nil cloth,
                        pitch and tar, oopper for sheathing vessels, marine engines and the
                        component parts thereof (including screw propellers, paddle wheels,
                        cylinders, cranks, shafts, boilers, tabes for boilers, boiler plates, and
                        fire bars), maritime cement and the materials used for its manufacture (as
                        blue lias and Portland cement), iron in any of the following forms :.
                        anchors, rivet iron, angle-iron, round bare of from 3/4 to 5/8 of an inch
                        diameter, rivets, strips of iron, sheet plate iron exceeding 1/4 of an inch,
                        and Low Moor and Bowling plates."</p>

                    <head>RACING ROUND THE WORLD. </head>
                    <p>Three months ago Lieut.-Colonel Burnley- Campbell read a newspaper article on
                        "The Speed of Travel," and decided to try for him­self how quickly Puck's
                        girdle could be put round the modern world. In a recent issue of Times'' he
                        writes to announce that he has encircled the earth in forty days, nineteen
                        and' a-half hours, and to inquire for better records, if any such are in
                        existence. It is gratifying to note that Colonel Burley-Campbell's flying
                        route was of an "All-British" character all the way from Liverpool to
                        Yokohama, inasmuch as he crossed both the Atlantic and the Pacific by C. P.
                        R. steamers, subsequently betaking him self to the Trans Siberian Railway,
                        and the usual line viA Berlin and Cologne to Ostend. One is not prepared to
                        suggest how the Colonel's itinerary can bo improved upon just at present,
                        although the people who are motoring across Mongolia at sixty miles an hour
                        might perhaps be able to cut into the trans-Siberian time­table.</p>

                            audience is enabled to enjoy a spectacle with words and music, a
                            fashionable audience was present and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. One
                            of the most noticeable records was Tamagno's death of Othello, which was
                            splendidly rendered, In the other records the personality of the artist
                            was in evidence, but as Tamagno had died before the cinematograph
                            reached its present stage of perfection, a pathetic interest attached to

                            usually the case. The entertainment will be given every evening.</p>

                        British Fleet to Alexandria, was held on the Sporting Club grounds on
                        Saturday afternoon. Excellent weather prevailed, and a fashionable
                        attendance, among whom several prominent members of Alexandrian society were
                        noticed, filled the stand and lawn. Looking across the course and grounds
                        one could hot help admiring the brilliant and animated scene afforded by the
                        white suits of the officers and men from the visiting ships, interspersed by
                        the khaki uniforms of our soldiers, and set off to advantage by the green
                        foliage and an oriental sun. During the afternoon the grounds were also
                        visited by a number of cadets from the Austrian man-of war, which arrived on
                        Saturday morning. Commencing at 2 p.m., tire preliminary ties of the tug of

                        was made for donkeys: in fact, the demand was greater than the supply. Roars

                        beaten by the "Prince of Wales" team and the "Suffolk" stokers proved

                        "Suffolk" stokers. Here too a good contest was witnessed, every, muscle
                        being strained to gain the slightest advantage. The 'Suffolk's" made a good

                        brute in a heap, and nothing was seen for some minutes but a struggling mass
                        of humanity, reminding one of a Rugby "scrum." When victor did issue forth

                    <head>Presentation to Lieut. Franklin<lb/>Retirement from the E.A.</head>
                    <p>On the occasion of the appointment of Lieut Franklin, Director in Chief of
                        Music in .the Egyptian Army, to be Director of the Royal Naval College of
                        Music at Eastleigh, this popular musician was entertained at dinner, last
                        night at Shepheard's hotel, and presented with a gold watch as a souvenir of
                        his in Egypt</p>
                    <p>Dr. Clark took the chair and in proposing the toast of the guest of the
                        evening, said that they were all familiar with Kiplings poem, on "8ergeant
                        what's-his-name" who had wade the Egyptian into a fighting mail,. but Lieut
                        Franklin had performed a more remark-, able feat—he had made him into a
                        musician. It was a surprising thing for any stranger coming to a land like
                        Egypt, where few of. the people Could even sign their own names to bar
                        Egyptian bands playing., all sorts of selections of European music, ranging
                        from the latest light opera to the "Tanhauser" Coverture—ahd this under
                        native conductor* This was Lieut Pranldjn's achievement but if they wished
                        to. bee his work at its best they mast see himself conducting one of his
                        favorite native bands, then they would see that he had indeed performed the
                        miracle of making music' out of Nil! mud. All this referred to his
                        professional services to the Egyptian Army. But the gathering at dinner did
                        not represent the army, but only a few civilian friends still left at the
                        end of the season ; and to them it would be even more interesting to recall
                        Lieut Franklin's splendid services in the cause of charity. Some years ago
                        ho composed and produced, in the cause of charity, his opera "Sesostris,"
                        which they might -one day see in-print; and more recently they had not
                        forgotten that memorable performance of 'The Pirates of Penzance" before the
                        Duke of Connaught, which realized toe record sum of over £1fl0 in an Opera
                        House which at foil Opera prices could, only hold £250, an occasion when one
                        stall alone sold for £50, which is probably a record for the Whole world.
                        Lieut. Franklin pulled this performance successfully through although
                        Working with amateur talent which, with all respect to. those present could
                        only be described as distinctly raw.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion - too chairman presented, the guest with a "Lord Cromer"
                        chronometer, inscribed on one' side with, the Ibis and Crescent of Egypt,
                        and on the other with the Globe and Scroll 'Ter Mare, Per Terrain" of the
                        Royal Marine*' while/on the dome was the subscription 'To Lieut. C.
                        Franklin, from a few civilian friends who have appreciated his musical
                        services in Egypt 1894-1907."</p>
                    <p>Lieut Franklin in reply made some most interesting remarks on the capacityof
                        Egyptians for music. He said that as reference had been made to his
                        professional work he must say that on*reason for the result obtained was the
                        splendid material that ho had to work with. He had trained Lands in England,
                        in Burma and else-where, but nowhere in the world, he asserted emphatically,
                        had he found such apt pupils as the Sudanese. Music, he said, was in them.
                        This statement, coming from such a high authority as Lieut Frank- klim must
                        be very gratifying to the native regiments.</p>
                    <p>Lieut Franklin further spoke of the great consideration and kindness which he
                        had received in his work from H.H. the Khedive, himself an excellent judge
                        of music. As to the "Lord Cromer" chronometer he. would greatly prize a gift
                        that bore the name of the great statesman whose departure had ceased so much
                        regret, but he could not, promise to wear the souvenir on every occasion for
                        it must regret precedence to the watch he most dearly prized which was.
                        given him by his own sergeants. (Loud chews).</p>

                    <p>The "Manchester Guardian," in its commercial notes remarks:</p>
                    <p>The strength of the cotton market-in Egypt is little short of remarkable in
                        view, of the collapse in stock* since the great majority of Egyptian
                        speculators are interested in both, and tremendous losses have been
                        experienced the stock market. The speculative position in cotton i*'however,
                        a somewhat elusive one at present. Our Alexandria 'correspondent, writing on
                        June 16, says that 'the fluctuations of the week just closed amount in the
                        abstract to a rise of 3-32T. on the old crop and a fall of 3/16T. on the new
                        July closing at 20} and November at ' 20, after touching 20} and 20 11/16
                        respectively during the week: It had been anticipated that 10,000 bales
                        would be shipped during the week, but the actual shipments only totaled
                        8,600 bale* against 4,000 last year, and this disappointment undoubtedly
                        checked the rise. As the difference between this and last year's shipments
                        now amounts to less than 10,000 bale* the disparity will soon be levelled if
                        the present rate of exportation continues. Notwithstanding the semblance of
                        activity which still sustains price* due among r causes to the report that a
                        Liverpool syndicate had been formed to operate on the July disparity of
                        price, it Is evident that America governs the market, and that there is no
                        particular strength at the bottom of Egyptian speculation apart from
                        this."</p>
