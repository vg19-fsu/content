                        works at Mex. The corpse was declared both by the caracol apd by the

                        found on the corpse makes it highly probable that the unfortunate man was

                        <p>A.8.0. GYMKHANA. </p>
                        <p>Saturday's Gymkhana at the A S.C. grounds was a decided sgocess. The
                            weather was favorable, a cool sea breeze reventing the san from
                            disturbing anybody's comfort. The attendance, considering the date, was
                            very fair, &amp; large number of ladies being present, and the events
                            were keenly contested. The proubnce of quite a strong Cairocontingent
                            added greatly to the interest of the proceedings. Mr. M. de O. Findlay
                            and Mrs. Findlay, the Hon. F. O. Lind. ley, Mr. and Mrs. Gould, Sir
                            William Garstin and Mr. Wobb, Major Hopkinson, and many other well-known
                            Anglo Egyptians watebed the events, which we describe in detail below: </p>
                        <p>TENT PEGGING.-There were 9 entries for the tent pegging, which was well
                            won by Mr. Simonds, who took all hia pegs in very nice style. Second
                            honors were divided between Messrs. Richmond and Trafford, who took two
                            pegs each. </p>
                        <p>HACK SCURRY.--For bona fide Hacks, 14.1 and under, that have never run in
                            a race at any race meeting in Egypt (Gymkhana szcepted) and do not
                            belong to any racing stable. Catch weights, over 11 st. Distance 3
                            farlongs. -A field of 16 turned out for this event, which was easily won
                            by Mr. Donaldson's Derry Boy, followed by Mr. Hoyami's Crieri and Mr.
                            Trafford's Port Said. Mr. Donaldson could not draw the 11 st. catch
                            weight by soupe Ibe. and the prize was therefore awarded to Mr. Hogami. </p>
                        <p>WHISTLING COON RACE. - This was the most amusing event of the day. The
                            competitors, after sprigting for 60 yards, lined up in front of their
                            partners, who were posted at the fence beside the judge'e box, and a
                            wonderful combination of melodiee filled the air for halt a minute. The
                            distracting effect of s donen tunes simultaneously whistled and the bad
                            condition of some of the sprinters, whose exertions on foot reduced
                            their whistling powers to a minimum, made identification difficult We
                            are assured that a lady to whom "The British Grenadiers" was whistled,
                            wrote down I the name of the air as "Bill Bailey," and that </p>
                        <p>There is a tavern in the town" was confused with l'he Honeysucklei and
                            the Bee." Mris. Moore was the winner, Capt. Basset's "Home, Sweet Home"
                            being quickly recognised, and Mrs. Gedge was second, Mr. Hemp'8"Auld
                            Lang Byne" being equally anmistakable. Our con gratulations to the
                            Berksbires on their musical efficiency </p>
                        <p>CIGAR AND UMBRELLA RACE.-Thirteen entries made a big field in this roe.
                            One or two parasole suffered and one of the competitors planted his
                            saddle dangerously near his pony's tail. Mr. Bartlett was first off but
                            dropped the parasol he wielded, and Mr. Richmond came in winner. </p>
                        <p>LADIES' BICYCLE RACE.(lastin wins). Won by Miss E. Allen. Mrs. Kalham was
                            &amp; good second. | POTATO AND BUCKET OOMPETI|TION.---There were 20
                            entries for this event, but most of the performers seemed rather at ses.
                            Mr. Jenkinson and Mr. Donaldson were finally given an extra run, which
                            was won by the former, who made the best individual run in the event,
                            getting in two potatoes out of three. </p>
                        <p>EGG AND SPOON RACE ON PONIES.This event brought 18 entries, inclading one
                            lady, into the field, and was won by Mr. Hemp. Very few competitors
                            arrived with their eggs unbroken. </p>
                        <p>At the close of the meeting, which did not last too long, Mrs. M. de C.
                            Findlay kindly distribated the prizes, and receiy. ed the cheers of all
                            present. The meeting was thoroughly well organised by the A. 8. C.
                            stewards and was greatly enjoyed by all present. The band of the lad
                            Royal Berkshire Regiment played selections of music during the
                            afternoon. </p>

                    <p>TARDON ON GOLF. if anyone has the right to lay down the law j on goll, nays
                        the "Evening Standanl," it ia the m m who has won tho open championship four
                        times—a record only equalled by the two Morrises, "Old Tom" and "Young Tom."
                        And in this book Harry Vardon shows that he is as jjoi 1 at preaching as at
                        practioo. As an instruc- for be is detailed but lucid. Thoroughly as he goes
                        into the question o( grip, stance, swing, . md the correct use of each club,
                        his explana- tions never become involved,and are materially helped out by a
                        numbor of excellent reproduc- tions of the author porforming the strokes cot
                        only in the right but also, by way of awful illustration, in the wrong way.
                        These latter poses, wo hasten to add, Vardon found it "most inconveuient
                        andjdifficalt" to assume. But they wear a fairly familiar look, somehow.
                        Vardon addresses himself to an audience alike of beginners and of
                        proficients. He keeps the "fancy" strokos in a separate cate- gory, howevor.
                        To the boginner he is at the same time encouraging and depressing.' It is
                        never too late to start. Even at forty or forty-five wo can reach scratch or
                        very near it, but—at least three months' persis- tent and laborious practice
                        is a tine qua non. As a shining example ho points to Mr. Balfour as having,
                        it is stated, "spent a miserable fortnight in bunkers only, learning how to
                        get out of them from every possiblo position." It is interesting Jo hear
                        that in Vardon's opinion the Premier isnowa very good and steady player, and
                        might be still better but for Parliamentary cares. Which is the master
                        stroke in golf 1 That is another very interesting point on which he records
                        his opinion. He awards tho palm to none of the ordinary shots, however
                        perfect 1'he greatest is tho stroke to which a big pull or slice is
                        intentionally applied for the accom- plishment of a specific purpose, which
                        could nut be achieved in any other way.</p>
                    <p>"I call it the master shot because, to ac- complish it with any certainty and
                        perfection, it is oo difficult even to the experienced golfer, because it
                        calls for tho most absolute command over the club and every nerve and sinew
                        of the body, and the courageous heart of the true sportsman whom no
                        difficulty may daunt, and because, when properly done, it ia a splendid
                        thing to soo, and for a certainty results in material gain to tho mab who
                        played it" The best course in the world, in Vardon's estimation, is
                        Sandwich. He acknowledges that he is at varianoe here with many of the best
                        authorities on the gamo, but Ire gives good reasons for his choice.
                        Prestwick and Hoy lake be puts next, but his verdict on St Andrews, passed,
                        of course, before the reoent championships, is one of distinctly modified
                        praise. It is "a good oourso generally, but its bunkers are badly placed."
                        And here the author is certainly uot alone in his opinion. lu the lighter
                        portion of his book, which, we must add, is written in really admirable
                        style, Vardon has collected a number of delightful golf auecdot.-, with
                        comparatively few chest- nuts among them. His visit to America in 1900, when
                        he won the American Champion- ship, was notable, among other thing*, for the
                        achievements of the reporters, who, trne to their tradition of
                        sensationalism, announced, one that he "carried away the green with his
                        drive," another that he "dropped dead at the hole." Pacts, however, were as
                        queer as fiction iu some parts of tho trip. On one Florida course men with
                        sticks had to bo kept con- stantly employed on the greens to keep the
                        locusts ofl the lines of the pntts !</p>
                    <p>But the best stories are to be found in the chapter "Conoeming Caddies."
                        There was a busy day on/jne occasion at North Berwick, when all the regular
                        caddies were out, and fishermen were drafted into the service. A well known
                        player engaged one of them, though the recruit acknowledged that he only
                        knew very little of the game.</p>
                    <p>"This player happened to be left-handed, and took up his etanoe on the first
                        tee aooord- ingly, whereupon the son of the sea at once' adopted tho part of
                        tutor, and with some warmth and show of ooutempt exclaimed loudly, 'I dinna
                        ken much about the game, l-t ye dinna keen a wee bit Mon, ye're stand- ing
                        on the wrong side of the baw! Awa' to . the other side ?' "</p>
                    <p>More disconcerting and less amusing (to the player) was the following
                        experience "Two golfers of some Highland eelebritywere playing a match one
                        day at Luff ness, and after a hard round they came to the eighteenth tee all
                        square and but this one bole to play. At this critical stage of the game the
                        caddie of one of them approached his master and nervously whispered to him,
                        'Please sir, wad ye do your very best here, for there's money on this
                        match.' And the goiter did try to do his very best indeed, but he pressed
                        and he foozled, and he lost the hole and the match. Sympathetically he
                        turned to his caddie to ask him what wus the amount of the lost wager that
                        he might pay it for him and soften his disappointment 'It was a penny, sir,'
                        said Use boy."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour figures in more than one plea- sant little incident "He has a
