                    <head>PARTIES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The discovery by the Nationalist Press that the much-talkedof article in the
                        "Times" hinted at the existence of certain divisions of thought among the
                        Nationalists of Egypt has aroused a discussion that appears to us better
                        suited to a people in the perambulator stage of political development than
                        to a public which claims, according to its journalistic representatives, to
                        have reached a high level of civilisation. Oceans of ink are now being
                        wasted in the effort to prove that the Egyptian people is—in political
                        af-fairs—one and indivisible, that it knows no parties and no divisions,
                        that the whole nation is "united in its demand for autonomy and
                        representative Government" ("Al-Min-bar"; and so forth, in fact, that the
                        world never saw so united a nation.</p>
                    <p>We are quite ready to admit that there are no organised parties in Egypt as
                        there are in England or France. But we cannot, for our lives, bring
                        ourselves to believe that every Egyptian sees eye to eye with his fellows in
                        his views as to political questions, and we cannot refuse to acknowledge the
                        existence of grave differences of opinion among Egyptians of high standing
                        as to what course should be followed in the future or should have been
                        followed in the part. This spring we had an instance of this in the
                        divisions of opinion that marked the Turkish crisis. Some of our ' confreres
                        were more Ottoman than the Sultan : they landed infantry brigades at
                        Alexandria and prepared us for epoch-making conflicts. Others expressed the
                        mild hope that matters would be arranged in a manner that would safeguard
                        the interests of the Ottoman Empire and of Egypt. There is a vast difference
                        between these points of view.</p>
                    <p>Consequently we are rather surprised to learn that many of our contemporaries
                        are not only incredulous of the existence of, let us say, "divisions" among
                        the Egyptian Nationalists, but regard the hint that they exist as a dire and
                        shameful insult. A strange insult! Contradictory opinions, the stress of
                        rival forces, the constant discussion of political and social problems, the
                        very exchange of oratorical missiles between rival politicians—these are the
                        very life and breath of the civilised modern state, the manifestations of
                        the power without which the state organism is a mere lifeless machine. But
                        here are our aspirants to self-government and what-not, our emulators of the
                        Japanese (whose parties are numerous and ardent in time of peace) protesting
                        with an infinite seriousness—that they have not yet reached a stage of
                        development which every civilised nation has attained.</p>
                    <p>"Al Watan" roundly asserts : "Lord Cromer . by his words and actions cast
                        among us the destructive torch (of political division), especially by making
                        distinctions between Egyptian and Egyptian, etc., etc." Was there ever such
                        an amazing misinterpretation of the facts! We doubt Lord Cromer's ability—we
                        doubt any man's ability—to create "parties" in the European sense among
                        Egyptians, for we are convinced that there is some truth in the old proverb
                        that "bricks cannot be made without straw. We will go further and say that
                        had Lord Cromer "created parties"—had he succeeded in forming among
                        intelligent Egyptians number of groups, each anxious to promote . the
                        welfare of Egypt, each blessed with courageous convictions and each ready
                        with definite constructive criticism, he would have achieved the impossible,
                        he would have made a populace into a nation in twenty years. But to shudder
                        at the word "party," to assert, a propos of every hint to the contrary, that
                        all Egyptians of intelligence think alike, have like political aims and
                        ideas—this is literally childish. The ideal civilised state is not a
                        barrack, a phalaustery, or a horde, but a union of a multitude of active
                        dissimilar personalities working in different ways to obtain the realisation
                        of their ideal—the welfare of the community. To judge from the comments of
                        the native Press, intelligent Egypt has not begun to realise what
                        civilisation really means.</p>

                    <head>BANQUET TO M. PRUNIERES.</head>
                    <p>On Monday evening a banquet was given at Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, by about a
                        hundred members of the Cairo Bar to M. Pianidres on the occasion of his
                        departure for Alexandria to take up his post in the Mixed Court of Appeal
                        here. M. Prunieres, who for a period of 21 years has filled the position of
                        President of the Mixed Tribunals at Cairo, has, as most of our readers are
                        aware, been recently nominated to be a ''Conaeiller" of the Mixed Court of
                        Appeal at Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Carton de Wiart was in the shair, and in an eloquent speech he -wished
                        M. Pro-nieres all success at Alexandria, at the same time expressing the
                        sincere regrets of all the members of the Cairo Bax at the loss they were to
                        suffer consequent upon the elevation of M. Prunieres to the Court of Appeal.
                        In these sentiments be was seconded by Maltre Cesar Adda, and after a
                        fitting reply from M. Prunieres, who in thanking his hosts mingled good
                        wishes to the seniors with words of encouragement to the juniors, Judge Tack
                        briefly addressed the company, who shortly alter dispersed their several
                        ways.</p>
                    <p>At the same time occasion was taken to present M. Prunieres with a polished
                        wooden casket modelled in the shape of a sarcophagus, and a parchment
                        address signed by the members of the Bar.</p>
                    <p>The reunion was in ,every way a most pleasant one and great praise mast be
                        accorded to Mr. Baehler, of Shepheard's Hotel, for the excellent dinner he
                        provided and the admirable way in which the whole banquet was carried out.

                    <head>OLD ANGLO-EGYPTIAN'S DEATH</head>
                    <p>By the death of William Hodgson Bey, which took place on the 5th inst. at
                        Ibrahiudeh, Alexandria, another link has-been severed from amongst the old
                        Anglo Egyptians who have done yeoman service in this country. The deceased
                        Bey came to Egypt. the year 1863 with the first cotton-ginning machine,
                        which was set up at Minet-el Gamh, and where he had the honour of explaining
                        the working of it to Said Pasha. He was afterwards employed by the Egyptian
                        State Railways as Engineer at old Benha Bridge, and after this was
                        transferred as erecting shop foreman to Gabbari, where he was recognised as
                        a thorough mechanic. In the year 1881 he was promoted to erecting shop
                        foreman at Boulac, Cairo, and during the bombardment of Alexandria his
                        valuable services were requisitioned in fitting up and running the armoured
                        train; he was granted Queen Victoria's Medal and the Khedive's Star for
                        these services. He was then promoted to carriage works manager at Cairo and
                        was thanked by the present Khedive's father for the taste and ability he
                        displayed in fitting up H.H's, train. After some years in this position he
                        was promoted to loco, works manager, which position he filled for 9 years
                        with great credit and until his retirement in 1906. During these years the
                        whole of the loco. works at Boulac were rebuilt and remodelled by Mr. F. H.
                        Trevithick, M.I.C K, chief mechanical engineer, and in this work he took an
                        important part in reconstructing and refitting with the most up-to-date
                        machinery. He was decorated by the Khedive with the 4th and 3rd Osmanieh,
                        and on his retirement was presented by Mr. Trevithick with a handsome silver
                        salver suitably inscribed, in recognition of his valuable services. The
                        deceased Bey was highly esteemed by everyone who came into contact with him,
                        and also by all those who worked under his supervision.</p>

                    <head>FREE FIGHT AT KASR EL NIL.</head>
                    <p>A violent quarrel took place between Italian workmen and Arabs at work on the
                        new Semiramis Hotel at Kasr el Nil on Monday. The dispute commenced by one
                        of the Italian workmen upsetting the supports of a low scaffolding, with the
                        result that two Arabs who were working on it were thrown down and badly
                        braised. The natives retorted by a similar practical joke at the expense of
                        the Italians, who, after picking themselves up, attacked their aggressors. A
                        free fight followed, in which knives were drawn, and stones sticks, and
                        other improvised weapons freely used, and had it not been for the presence
                        of mind of the foreman and architect in charge, lives would probably have
                        been lost. As it was four Arabs were severely injured and removed to
                        hospital, and several Europeans sustained slight injuries.</p>

                    <p>Referring to the above "Al Mokattam" says :—The fable of AEsop concerning the
                        ass clothed in the lion's skin cannot be more apro-sitely applied than to
                        the case of Mustapha Kamel, who felt it incumbent upon himself to open
                        communications with certain Liberals carried away by the excitement of the
                        Denish-wai affair. He was (for the nonce) the most influential of Egyptians,
                        the head of the Nationalist party before whom the whole nation bowed. He did
                        his utmost with the result that certain young people, one or two French and
                        English journalists among them, took his allegations for Gospel. Moreover,
                        he took care to despatch as many telegrams as possible which were calculated
                        to impress certain imbe-ciles who were convinced that the reason, the
                        eloquence, and the genins of their leader had won the statesmen of England.
                        He went so far as to make some portentously absurd statements to a
                        correspondent of the "Pall Mall Gazette."</p>
                    <p>On his return his disillusionment was gigantic. The friendship of some of his
                        trusted friends was fleeting indeed. Thereupon he did his best to spread the
                        belief among Europeans and natives that the cream of the nation approved of
                        his conduct, that the leading British Parliamentarians held him in high
                        esteem and followed his advice, and so forth, till a certain public believed
                        that he held the destinies of Egypt in his hands.</p>
                    <p>He informed the world at large that H.H. the Khedive was his protector and
                        friend and had paid him a round sum to aid his new journal.The "Times
                        fastened upon Mustapha Pasha's allegations, as the public knows.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile we may as well state that half his subscribers are not Egyptians,
                        but sons or former officials of Turkish, Arnaout or Circassian origin. They
                        do not approve of the present situation, and they are right to object to a
                        regime that deprives them of their ancient powers and prerogatives.</p>
                    <p>Others are ex-officials, retired for one reason or another, who flittered the
                        Government when in office and now very ' naturally criticise the former
                        object of their syco phancy.</p>

                        best in spite of its curtailment, and the luxuriant tropical trees and
                        shrubs effectually hide from view the desolation that lies beyond the
                        newly-built wall. Those who have ever visited Ceylon are always struck by
                        this beautiful garden with its red paths and brilliant verdure, and at the
                        present it would almost hear comparison with the Garden of Eden itself.</p>

                        are not expected till after the commencement of the New Year.</p>

                    <head>AN ECHO OF THE PAST.</head>
                    <p>Mr. J. Clunn, the head of the well-known firm of Geo. W. Wheatley and Co., of
                        London, Liverpool, and Bombay, East India agents and carriers, is at present
                        at Shepheard's Hotel. He intends shortly making the Nile trip as far as
                        Assouan, before proceeding to Nice for the winter.</p>
                    <p>The firm was formerly named Waghorn and Co., and it was founded some 60 years
                        ago by the late Lieut Waghorn, R N., the pioneer of the overland route, long
                        before the Sues Canal or railways were thought of in Egypt. In those days
                        the mails were brought down by the Mahmondieh Canal from Alexandria to
                        Cairo, and thence on camel back to Suez, where they were embarked on one of
                        the sailing vessels belonging to the old Indian Marine and con-veyed to
                        Bombay, reaching there from London in about two or three months, which was
                        considered a great feat compared with the six months or, so occupied by the
                        Cape route. The vessels that earned the mails then could now be stowed on
                        the deck of the P. and Q. leviathans that traverse the Suez Canal</p>

                    <head>TELEGRAPHISTS' WAIL<lb/>PETITION TO GOVERNMENT</head>
                    <p>The following petition has been presented to the Government by the State
                        Telegraph employes: -</p>
                    <p>We, the undersigned, telegraph employe, beg to submit our present claim which
                        we are sure will meet with the kind consideration of the Government in whose
                        hands stands the welfare of each of us. At the moment when a decision as to
                        the Pension Law seems to be at hand, we must appeal to the equity of our
                        superiors and point out to them how our position differs from that of any
                        other Government employes and therefore deserve special treatment and
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>The official Government duty hours are 5, daily, representing a yearly total
                        amount of about 1825 hours ; from this amount are to be deducted all the
                        holidays, viz.</p>

                    <p>66 x 5=330</p>
                    <p>Leaving an approximate total of 1495 hours per year.</p>
                    <p>The duty imposed on all the telegraph employes is a minimum of 8 hours daily,
                        by day as well as by night without break throughout the year, representing
                        therefore a total amount of 2920 hours per year, exactly the doable of what
                        all other Government employes do.</p>
                    <p>We abstain from calculating the ordinary and extraordinary leaves of absence
                        which all other Government employes obtain every year whereas, many of os
                        are hardly granted 15 days leave of absence a year. Besides this we must
                        point out that our lives are con tinually exposed to danger and our health
                        seriously impaired through excess at work.</p>
                    <p>We also most mention the heavy responsibilities incumbent upon ns; the lives
                        of passengers, the goods of merchants, the money of bankers and of the
                        public in general and the urgent official correspondence all depend upon our
                        steadiness and accuracy in the performance of our duties. An error, the
                        slightest oversight, might be the cause of most regrettable accidents, the
                        loss of human lives, of money, etc. etc. Therefore we consider that, as
                        compered with other administrations, the basis on which our salaries is
                        established is not a fair retribution for the amount and value of the work
                        being done by us.</p>
                    <p>Now, when after 25 or 30 years extenuating services we are put on pension, we
                        have nothing to live upon, except the miserably inadequate sum which is not
                        sufficient to keep holy and soul together, if we consider the unprecedented
                        rise in price of all the necessities of life which has still more aggravated
                        our case. We may with justice say that our present salaries have been
                        reduced in value to one half their nominal figure and that wo are now
                        getting less for our services than 20 years back; the slight increases given
                        to the old hands not even keeping pace with this abnormal situation, we ask:
                        Would it not be fair to admit the striking reality of the case and make some
                        provision in the Pension Law for those who have worked well and faithfully
                        for the Administration under such trying circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We therefore respectfully beg that in consideration of the above facts which
                        we dare hope will be appreciated on their intrinsic merits, we may obtain a
                        special and better treatment in the settlement of our pension. We do hope
                        the Govt, will feel this an obligation which alone can remunerate the
                        valuable services we have rendered especially in times of unrest, there are
                        those amongst us who have rendered signal services to the same of order and
                        have been awarded with medals and grades but the recognition which in their
                        situation would have been most desirable was not afforded them; they were
                        denied the benefit of their works which, we believe, is an essential
                        condition to encouraging faithful servants in the performance of their hard
                        work and self-sacrifice for the future.</p>

                    <p>We (the journalistic "we") are still a bachelor and, if we are to see many
                        plays of the stamp of "Amoureuse," are likely to remain so. After all the
                        bother of falling in love, lapsing into respectability, and overcoming
                        suspicions of your wife's fidelity, to then find marriage insupportable
                        because your wife loves yon too much : "Ah, ca non par exemple,"—a little
                        ejaculation without which, by the way, no French play is complete. Of course
                        the piece is utterly impalpable. A certain amount of credit is due to M. de
                        Porto Riche for lighting on an original phase in a subject which, one would
                        have thought, had been turned and twisted in every conceivable way by every
                        conceivable author. But having hit on his phase, frail and empty though it
                        be, he rests contented. The husband loves ration-the wife overwhelmingly,
                        and the friend ( save the mark! ) degradingly ; there is Act 1. The husband
                        becomes exasperated, the wife revolting, and the friend treacherous; so much
                        for Act. II. Act III. constitutes a would be happy ending. A stage
                        expression of this very light scheme occupied, including those stricken
                        entr'actes, some three hours and, but for the infidelity affair in Act II,
                        husband and wife are on practically the same footing as they were at the
                        start. To be candid, the play left a rather bitter taste in the mouth. We
                        looked in vain for refinement or even literary merit: we met with only
                        coarse jokes and voluptuous allusions. Perhaps our ideas are too English,
                        but no amount of Entente Cordiale will reconcile one to each a length as
                        this, But how inimitable are the French 1 Who but they coaid have made so
                        forcible a thing out of almost nothing ? Sooner which, to read or see

                        displays of their talents in their * onerously lengthy idles. Mile Brandi
                        gave a telling impersonation of the adoring and exacting, petulant and
                        outrageous wife, "while M. Ronselle faithfully portrayed the at first
                        patient then incensed husband. M. Gonrnao gave a very satisfactory account

                                the situation said he was grieved at the necessity for resorting to
                                extreme measures, but they were indispensable. 'Neither persecution
                                nor martyrdom would prevent us protecting our religion : our cause
                                was God's.'' (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>House of Common— The House was crowded yesterday evening. Numerous
                                Peers were present in the galleries. Mr. Birrell 'explained that the
                                Government had resolved to return the Lords' amendments to the
                                Education Bill, not because they were all bad, but because they
                                would involve at least 80 divisions, and endless prolongation and
                                complica tion in debate. The resolution which Sir H. Campbell
                                Bannerman will move to-day rejecting the amendments en bloc is quite
                                unusual. Its object is supposed to be to throw the whole
                                responsibility on the Lords.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Balfour declared that the Government's action would constitute a
                                precedent absolutely destructive to free criticism. He would rather
                                see the Bill perish than adopted in the Government's shape. Mr.
                                Redmond said that if the Bill failed to pass owing to the Government
                                refus ing to make concessions, it would- be most serious for the
                                Government and the Liberal party. </p>

                    <head type="sub">THE LINE TO KHARGEH.</head>
                    <p>The Oasis of Khargeh is separated from the Nile. Valley by 120 miles of
                        barren desert, and the most pressing duty of fire Corporation of Western
                        Egypt is to get on with the complete tion of the railway. Until the railway
                        is finished the work of development will be always hampered, for carriage by
                        pack camel across the desert is very costly. Goal now cost from £9 to £10
                        fit Khargeh, but as soon as . the line is completed this will be reduced to
                        a little over £2 The cost of fuel hinders opera tions considerably for it is
                        obviously very expensive to work the steam drilling plant for boring under
                        these conditions Taking a camel load at 180 kilos, it is Obvious that the
                        transport of American steam drills and other material is an undertaking of
                        great difficulty while boilers and drill frames, etc., have to be taken
                        across on wheels by means of draught camels and a good road has had to be
                        cut down the steep cliff from the desert plateau During the pioneer
                        expedition from January to April, 1905, the number of camel journey] across
                        the desert was about 1,300, and the total weight of machinery, coals, and
                        stores carrier amounted to about 170 tons. Camel transport is totally
                        'inadequate, and the energies of the Corporation within the next few months
                        will have to be chiefly concentrated oft getting the line through. Until
                        then no large additions areas of land can be brought under cultivation nor
                        can- the mineral; wealth of the concession be developed.</p>
                    <p>The sail way concession is for a period of seventy years, during which time
                        the company has a monopoly of railway communication between the Valley of
                        the Nile and the oases During the first twenty years of this period no other
                        railway can be made within the area served by the line under construction
                        without the Corporation being first offered the right to construct. The
                        Government guarantees interest at the rate of three per cent. per annum on
                        the cost of construction for twenty years, unless in any year the total net
                        profits earned by the company are sufficient to pay 3 per cent, on the total
                        share capital of the company. The interest is payable out of surplus
                        revenues of the oases, as defined by the conces-sion, over a period of
                        twenty five years. The Corporation has also the right to construct further
                        railways within the same area, upon application at any time within twenty
                        years. The Government have the power &amp; expropriate the railway after the
                        expiration of thirty years, on payment to the company of, the value of all
                        lands, works, materials, and plant suitable, to and used for the purpose of
                        the railway (such value to be in case of difference or dispute determined
                        -by arbitration), and on payment also of an annual sum until the expiration
                        of the seventy years equal to the average annual net profits derived from
                        the railway for the preceding five years minus a sum equal t four per cent,
                        on the amount to be paid as value.</p>
                    <p>Only 77 kilometres have as yet been finished, and work on that line has been
                        suspended for some time pending the arrival of the material, 1,260 tons of
                        which are now coming out from England. The total length of the line from the
                        Nile Valley to Khargeh junction, where it connects with the Egyptian
                        Government's railway system, will be 120 kilometres, but the line will be
                        pushed- on to Dakhleh as soon as ever Khargeh station is in working order.
                        Dakhleh is 120 kilometres to the west and there is level ground all the way
                        from one oasis to the other. A system of road transport may. be started,
                        either by motor or otherwise, till the rail is finished, as from Khargeh to
                        Dakhleh one could drive a coach.</p>
                    <p>The progress of the line has been at the rate of a kilometre a day, and when
                        the material arrives it is hoped that the railhead will be advanced two
                        kilometres daily. The work began last January and as 115 kilometres now
                        remain to be completed, Khargeh should be connected with the Nile Valley
                        early in the coming year. The railway base is at Karnak, near Famhout, and
                        is two miles from Khargeh junction on the main line. Here are the work shops
                        and three locomotives and 25' trucks. The European staff here is composed of
                        Mr. Hornblower, the superintendent, Mr. Howard, assistant-superintendent,
                        Mr. Jones, assistant-engineer in charge, Mr. Fothergill, engineer-incharge
                        of construction, and a foreman. There is an excellent supply of well water
                        and the quarters, situated on the- edge of the desert, are comfortable and-
                        healthy. The shops are in </p>
                    <p>charge of Mr. Saunders, the foreman, and the smart appearance of the engines
                        and the business-like and neat look of things in general at the railway base
                        reflect great credit on Mr Hornblower and his staff. Labour is easily
                        obtained, and there are very amicable relations existing between the local
                        sheikhs and omdehs and the Corporation's staff. Ordinary labourers get P.T.
                        4$- and raises P.T. 10 per day. The base is connected by telephone with the
                        State railways and railhead. The company employ 180 raises and men for
                        platelaying. The contract for the formation of the road is in the hands of
                        Messra Gusman and Co., of Cairo, and the rood has boon made as far as
                        kilometre 90, ten kilometres beyond railhead. The gauge is 75 centimetres,
                        which is the standard narrow gauge used on the Delta Railways and other
                        Egyptian lines. The- steepest gradient is 1 in 40. The construction of the
                        existing road is excellent and the running is very easy. There are no
                        serious difficulties to be met with in constructing the line, the only
                        problem to be encountered being the steep descent from the plateau to the
                        Oasis. Here the gradient will be 1 in 25, which, although steep, is not
                        without precedent in narrow gauge railway construction. As soon as the line
                        is finished the first chapter in the history of the development of the
                        southern oases will be closed. When once railway communication is
                        established with the Nile Valley a great impetus will be given to the export
                        of the agricultural and mineral wealth of the oases. Immigrants from the
                        thickly populated centres in Upper Egypt will flock to the sparsely
                        inhabited and well watered depressions in the Libyan desert which, after a
                        lapse of fifteen hundred centuries, will resume their ancient prosperity and
                        be numbered among the richest of Egypt's fertile provinces.</p>

                        provincial agricultural shows may be welcomed in that they bring before the
                        general public examples of native handiwork; on a small scale, it is true,
                        but none the less interesting as evidences of the way in which the fellah
                        can employ his time during the intervals of cultivation. These intervals are
                        mu£h«Tarer, of course, than formerly, since perennial irrigation has
                        replaced the sefi, and tho labour problem is felt in no small measure Dy
                        cultivators of the converted lands. Whether this will lead to "any

                        were, on the whole, well r-epivsHoted, with two notable exceptions, namely,

                        seen. The small white and brown caps worn by the fellaheen,resembling the

                        are also woven and used, but the woolleffproducts are not remarkable in any
                        way.</p>
                    <p>In the same stall of exhibits, a man was weaving a material from silk and
                        cotton which closely resembles our alpaca. This work was highly finished,
                        and the material should make excellent suits for summer. It is nob
                        expensive, sufficient for a suit costing aboi.fe $T.150 up country. The
                        colours and designs are simple and good, the two best being an ordinary
                        black stripe on white ground, and bl^ck checks on white g$und much like our
                        familiar shepherd's plaid. The natives use this material for thejr l-jest

                    <p>THE MINIEH AGRICULTURAL SHOW.</p>
                    <p>Small attention has till now been-paid to the home industries of Egypt by any
                        but a few specialists, who may have had time and opportunity to ferret them
                        out, in their some what inaccessible surroundings. For this reason alone the
                        provincial agricultural shows may be welcomed in that they bring before the
                        general public examples of native handiwork; on a small scale, it is true,
                        but none the less interesting as evidences of the way in which the fellah
                        can employ his time during the intervals of cultivation. These intervals are
                        much rarer, of course, than formerly, since perennial irrigation has
                        replaced the sefi, and the labour problem is felt in no small measure by
                        cultivators of the converted lands. Whether this will lead to any
                        appreciable diminution of home products remains to be seen ; it will be
                        regrettable should it prove so.</p>

                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.''</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir, — My attention has just been drawn to the leading article in
                            your issue of</p>
                        <p>November 30th. It endeavours to reply to some recent criticisms of the
                            present regime in Egypt, and lays down certain principles of political
                            philosophy which cannot fail to cause surprise, the more especially as
                            they come from an organ of English public opinion. I would first remark,
                            in parenthesis, that I do not suppose the views you advance of the true
                            relationship of the executive to the judiciary will be at all acceptable
                            to the authorities whose policy you defend.</p>
                        <p>If I may recapitulate your astounding argument, it is briefly to the
                            effect that in ary welt ordered country it is essential that the
                            executive government should have the power to control, and if need be,
                            disregard the Courts of Law. You add that if it were not so, the Courts
                            of Law would be the real government of the country and might "over rule
                            the law and thus obtain despotic power," and thus "the liberty, rights,
                            and lives of the public would be placed at their mercy."</p>
                        <p>Now, sir, I think the principles you initiate ''Will sound strangely to
                            your English readers. We are accustomed to believe that good government!
                            is based on two fundamental' prin-ciples; first, that all authority
                            should, as far at may be, be exercised in accordance with the
                            traditional or pre-ordained rules and record, that no one man or body of
                            men should have all the authority of government concentrated in his or
                            its hands. In all civilised countries these principles are put into
                            practice by dividing the powers of government into three independent
                            parts—the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. The work of the
                            latter is to interpret the existing laws and apply them to particular
                            oases ; if the laws as applied by the Judiciary prove inconvenient or
                            defective, it is for the Legislature to correct them. To leave such a
                            power of correction to the Execu-tive to be exercised, as the
                            Government- may think fit in particular cases, would indeed be to
                            authorise arbitrary rule.</p>
                        <p>One finds in history that the best government countries have been those
                            where the law has been used by the Government, not as instru meat in its
                            hands for the enforcement of its authority and will blindly, but as a
                            co-relative to check any abase of its power. It cannot be asked Who is
                            superior. It is Government who selects its law officers and appoints
                            them, as I have said, not blindly or to carry out any enactment made by
                            it, but as an aid, to interpret wisely such enactments and deliver
                            justice. </p>
                        <p>As long as there is a Legislature, no Judiciary can take the bit between
                            its teeth and usurp the Government of the country. And in this
                            connection it is pertinent to remark that even this risk is run and the
                            Judiciary is made supreme over the ordinary legislature, in those
                            countries where the Constitutional guarantees for individual rights and
                            rights of minorities are greatest, such, for instance, the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Solicitude for liberty has before now made men jealous not only of the
                            Executive but also of the Legislature, and English history shows that
                            the law has been most zealous in protecting the liberties of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>It has, I imagine, been reserved for the writer of your leader to hold up
                            the Judiciary as a danger for freedom. He is surely oblivious of the
                            fact that it is the essentially legal spirit of the British
                            Constitution, both at home and abroad, which constitutes, by the
                            admission of all critics, their especial glory. With the exception of
                            the United States, there is certainly no community outside the British
                            Empire where the supremacy of the law (and therefore necessarily the
                            Courts of Law) is so much cherished as with ourselves.</p>
                        <p>In short, it is for the Courts not only to interpret and enforce the laws
                            but to protect and enforce the rights of citizens, and where the rights
                            of the individual clash with those of the Government, the latter, for
                            the due administration of Justice, can but be treated as a corporate
                            body.</p>
                        <p>You say that the criticisms you reply to "have been based upon the
                            assumption that the Government," i.e. thro Executive, 'stand-in the same
                            relation to the law and the Courts of Justice as if it were nothing more
                            than a</p>
                        <p>private individual," and in truth this assumption has been accepted at
                            least in all English-speaking countries, and may now be considered an
                            axiom. — I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir. — Assuming that a better who hacks a winning horse either to
                            win or or a place should at least recover the amount of h original
                            stake, there can be no doubt "Viator" has not only drawn your attention
                            to -what should have been obvious long ago, but has suggested a very
                            workable remedy. Perhaps his letter is too mathematical for some of your
                            readers to work out. To such I would put the question, Have you ever
                            backed the favourite for a place and paid your 20 piastres and in return
                            have received less than 20 piastres'? If yon have had much, experience
                            of the Khedivial Sporting Club races I may safely assume your answer to
                            be affirmative. I is possible, though not mathematical, the light of
                            Nature has warned you against backing at almost certain place horse on
                            the Pari-future system as practised in Cairo, and thereby you have been
                            saved a certain loss on your venture. If the answer to the above
                            question be affirmative, it is obvious that every additional 20 piastres
                            ticket in which the foolish backer.invests involves an additional loss.
                            So much for ''Viator's" letter. </p>
                        <p>I would suggest that the theory of his protest should be carried further.
                            Why should a man lose 10% of a winning bet before any ultimate
                            calculations us to the value of his bet he worked out ? To explain my
                            meaning let us take an extreme cass. I happen to be the only man to back
                            the accepted favourite for a winner. No one else puts any money on the
                            face, knowing it to be a foregone conclusion. I can only receive 18;-
                            for every 1 which I have been foolish enough to stake—a further proof,
                            if any were needed,that the more I stake on a winning bet the more I
                            lose.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that the 10% which the club deducts should be deducted
                            from the total value of losing tickets and that the winners should
                            receive the price of their ticket pins their share of the 90% of the
                            total value of the losing tickets. This scheme should apply both to
                            betting for a place and a win, and it is the only fair one if my
                            original assumption that a backer who wins should receive back at least
                            his money ba considered a sound one-—I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p>Sir,—With reference to a paragraph headed "Cruelty to Animals" in your
                            issue of the 7th inst., may I be permitted to point out that the latter
                            part of your correspondent's statement is very misleading The servants
                            of the society are forbidden to seize animals for treatment. During the
                            month of May, when the society commenced operations, there certainly
                            were one or two cases where the servants of the society seized animals,
                            and on one occasion a slight disturbance ensued which was quelled by the
                            arrival of myself with a policeman. Save these one or two isolated cases
                            all the animals that we have had for treatment, some 350 in all, have
                            been seized by the police. On a few occasions also I have myself, when
                            no policeman was handy, per sonally conducted animals to the Markaz, but
                            on none of these occasions has there been a disturbance in Sohag. — I

                    <p>PROBABLY every case of consumption begins with a cold. </p>
                    <p>Consumption is generally classed as a hereditary disease, but consumption is
                        not hereditary. </p>
                    <p>A constitutional weakness is inherited which renders one liable to
                        consumption. </p>
                    <p>Even people who have strong lungs may acquire consumption from a cold. </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Addie Harding, 121 W, Brighton Ave., Syracuse, N. Y., writes: </p>
                    <p>"I have been a user of Peruna for the last twelve years and can truthfully
                        say that there is no better medicine on earth. </p>
                    <p>"A SURE PREVENTATIVE." </p>
                    <p>"With me it is a sure preventative for colds and many other ills. In my home
                        can always be found a bottle of Peruna. Two or three times a year I am
                        troubled with my throat. </p>
                    <p>"I always had to have the services of my physician two or three times in each
                        case. </p>
                    <p>"Although a user of Peruna, I never thought of taking it for my throat until
                        about two years ago.</p>
                    <p>"I tried Peruna to check it, and to my great delight I was not troubled with
                        the smothered and choked feeling and never have since. </p>
                    <p>"I can check it every time with Peruna. </p>
                    <p>"I certainly would not be without Peruna one minute." </p>

                        writes: </p>
                    <p>"I have been annoyed with a cough for years. </p>
                    <p>"Often it was so bad that I could not sleep half the night. Many people
                        thought I had consumption.</p>
                    <p>CONSUMPTION WAS FEARED.</p>
                    <p>"A woman recommended Peruna to me two years ago. I began to take Peruna and
                        now I am perfectly free from a cough, </p>
                    <p>"I am glad to say that Peruna cured me entirely, I take Peruna occasionally
                        when I do not feel well and I also give it to my children. </p>
                    <p>"Peruna is the best medicine for coughs and colds. I have told many people
                        how much Peruna has helped me." </p>
                    <p>A neglected cold is a well-worn path to consumption. </p>
                    <p>Many a person catches cold and pays no attention to it. </p>
                    <p>He scarcely recovers from the first cold when he takes the second.</p>
                    <p>Still he gives it no heed, and possibly takes another cold, and so on. </p>
                    <p>He doses himself with bromides, quinine and various expectorants. </p>
                    <p>His case is catarrh, at this stage, and his case should be treated as
                        catarrh. </p>
                    <p>A common cold is acute catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Finally, if the cold is allowed to continue, it becomes chronic catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Mrs, Frances Wilson, 82 Nelson street, Clinton, Mass., writes: </p>
                    <p>"Had you seen me at the time of my illness and now, you would not wonder that
                        1 take delight in sounding the praises of Peruna. </p>
                    <p>"My ailment was a severe cold which attacked the bronchial tubes and lungs. </p>
                    <p>"I followed your special directions and after using six bottles of Peruna I
                        was on my feet again.</p>
                    <p>"I think Peruna a wonderful medicine." </p>
                    <p>All colds, coughs, bronchitis, laryngtis and tonsilitis should be treated as
                        catarrh, as they are in reality catarrh. </p>
                    <p>The success of Peruna in relieving these cases entirely depends upon the fact
                        that Peruna is a catarrh remedy. </p>
                    <p>It relieves catarrh wherever located in the system. Whether in the throat,
                        bronchial tubes or lungs. </p>
                    <p>CONSUMPTION PREVENTED.</p>
                    <p>It has saved a multitude of peo-ple from consumption by eradicating catarrh
                        before it reaches the lungs. </p>
                    <p>The tendency of catarrh of the throat or head is to spread downward to the
                        lungs. </p>
                    <p>If taken in time, Peruna will prevent these cases. </p>
                    <p>We have in our files many testimonials from people who thought they were
                        victims of consumption, but have been permanently relieved by the faithful
                        use of Peruna. thus showing that catarrh was really the cause of their

                    <p>The secretary issues the following information:—"Owing to the death of the
                        company's late manager, the reports from the mine have been unduly delayed,
                        bat the following brings the news up to date: The total footage for the
                        three months ended 31st October, 1906, amounted to 377 ft 9 ins. The man
                        shaft No. 5 was sunk 43 ft 9 ins. and is now a total depth of 357 ft 9 ins.
                        The main shaft crossout at the C level is now completed. At 24 ft from the
                        shaft a leader was out, measuring 8 ins wide and assaying 7.7 dwts, and at
                        38 ft from the shaft the crosscut connected with the south drive from winze
                        B.N.l. This drive advanced a further 47 ft during the three months, the face
                        now being 59 ft south of the main crosscut. Northwards from winze B.N.l a
                        farther 28 ft 6 ins was driven, and this face is now 118 ft north from the
                        main crosscut.,Both in the north and in the south drives the reef opened up
                        shows an average width of 18 1/2 ins and an average value of 6.5 dwts. No. 1
                        shaft was sunk an additional 10 the total depth now being 325 ft, and
                        connected with C level, which is being driven north and south from the
                        point. In the south drive (24 ft long) the reef averages 23 ft 6 ins-wide,
                        and the assays show an average of 8.9 dwts. In the north drive (89 ft long)
                        the average width of the reef is 47.1 ins and the average value 17.1 dwts.
                        The north drive from winze, B.S.l, advanced 1 ft 6 ins and the south drive 7
                        ft 6 ins. Here the reef averaged 46 ins wide and assayed from a trace to 4
                        dwts. The faces of the drives are now 14 ft north and 25 ft south
                        respectively. Wine B.N.2 was sunk 40 ft, making a total depth of 68 ft from
                        collar. The average width of reef exposed was 23.1 ins; the average value
                        8.5 dwts. Winze B.8.2 is 93 ft down, being an additional 60 ft for the three
                        months. The average width of reef was 13.1 ins ; the average value 8.2 dwts.
                        The first winze below the C level has been started, and has reached a depth
                        of 27 ft (winze C.N.l). The reef in this winze is split into stringers,
                        separated by mullock. Over an average width of 71.2 ins of this mixture of
                        mullock and quartz the average value was 6 6 dwts. As almost all the gold is
                        in the quartz, and as this will be to a certain extent hand picked before
                        milling, the actual value is higher than indicated above."</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>

                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
