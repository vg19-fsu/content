                    <head>LORD CROMER'S RESIGNATION</head>
                    <p>The announcement of Lord Cromer's resignation has been received everywhere
                        with the sincerest expressions of regret, for the career of no living
                        statesman has been so bound up with the welfare and development of a country
                        as has that of Lord Cromer with modern Egypt. It was known that of late his
                        health had been waning and within the last twelve months his Lordship has
                        aged perceptibly, but there were no suspicions that matters had come to such
                        a pass as to necessitate his immediate cessation from the cares of State. We
                        sincerely hope that he will still have many years yet to live and will long
                        be spared to watch the continuous progress of the country under the guidance
                        of his successor.</p>
                    <p>It has fallen to the lot of no other man in modem times to so completely
                        identify himself with the Government of a foreign country in the sense of
                        "L'Etat o'est moi" as has Lord Cromer with Egypt. At no time since the
                        deposition of Ismail Pasha had England been confronted with a more difficult
                        situation in Egypt, or one requiring greater influence and authority to
                        enable her to deal with it than in the two years immediately subsequent to
                        the return of Lord Cromer to Cairo with the reputation which he had won for
                        years previously as a financier enhanced by a three years management of the
                        revenues of India. It was fortunate that at that crisis in our Egyptian
                        policy we were ablo to command the services of such a great diplomatist and
                        administrator. Of all the great reforms which in the course of the next
                        decade were to convert Egypt from a land of fiscal oppression and judicial
                        corruption into a country whiolp as regards government taxation and admin
                        straiion, will bear compari­son with any other Oriental country under</p>
                    <p>European rule, Lord Cromer was the life and soul. The memory of the public in
                        Egypt is extraordinary short-lived and we are accustomed now-a-days to
                        consider such portents as the Nationalist Press et hog genus omnte, assigns
                        of troublous times, but when we consider the extraordinary difficulties
                        connected with the reform of the Government of Egypt and the revival of her
                        prosperity in the face of native opposition, French hostility, and
                        indifference at home, the difficulties that have now to be contended with
                        appear utterly contemptible.</p>
                    <p>The whole of this great work of con­struction was achieved by Lord Cromer in
                        the teeth of constantly recurring obstacles and under the shadow of
                        continual discour­agements It. was achieved without assist­ance from any of
                        those European Power, who should have sympathised with the work in the name
                        of onr common civilisation, . but amid the indifference of all, and against
                        the covert or overt opposition of some. It was wrought through unwilling
                        native instruments, and encountered impediments of native prejudice and
                        native interest at every stage. Whether we look at the dimensions of the
                        task which Lord Cromer has accomplished in Egvpt or at the multitude and
                        magnitude of the difficulties, which had to be overcome in its
                        accomplishment, we are surely entitled to reckon Lord Cromer's work as one
                        of the most notable exploits in the history of Europe's dealings with the
                        East. If England, in the words of the late Mr. Traill in his life of Lord
                        Cromer, concentrating her strength for self-defence, were forced tomorrow to
                        retire from Egypt—even as Rome, our prototype in history, withdrew her
                        legions from onr own shores when her enemies gathered on her frontier—the
                        last two decades of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
                        century would still be remembered in the Nile Valley as a period when for
                        the first time for countless generations, law and order and security reigned
                        under the regis of a Power which has spread these blessings over half the
                        world when the stream of justice flowed pure from its fount, and the rich
                        man could no more deflect its course than he could divert the waters of the
                        Nile from the plot of the poorest cultivator; when the hand of the oppressor
                        was stayed over the people, and the extortions of the tax-gatherer were made
                        to cease, and the lash was wrested from the task master, and the peasant
                        every­where ate of the fruit of his labour, no man making bim afraid.
                        Although tha recollection of these things may pass away in Egypt itself, for
                        there are unfortunately sigus that the l>eople are unworthy of the benefits
                        they havo received, yet wherever'the tale of this great and beneficent work
                        is told, the name of the English administrator who guided ita whole course
                        from commencement to completion, whose nuconquerable patience overcame one
                        by one all the obstacles that impeded it, whose sagacity foresaw and whose
                        firmness averted all the dangers that threatened it, will claim a place at
                        the head of every chapter of the noble narrative and be recalled with honour
                        on every page.</p>

                            Engineer-i ing." This coupling, in its present form, may be described as
                            representing the latest modified design of one which has been in use in
                            Egypt for some time. The Bain coupling possesses the advantage that it
                            can be fitted. So existing rolling stock. All that it is necessary to do
                            is to move the ordinary draw-hook, put the coupling bar in its place,
                            and fit up the helical springs and the disengaging gear. The hole in the
                            headstock may need enlarging slightly, but this is not always the Case.
                            It is said that the transformation can be made in about an hour and
                            half. We understand that Mr. Bain is about to make arrangements for the

                    <p>The feeling expressed in Cairo at Lord Cromer's retirement may be expressed
                        in two words—"regret" and "consternation." Lord Cromer's health was known to
                        have given some anxiety during the last two months, but, outside a very
                        small circle, no one realised how serious was his condition.</p>
                    <p>We understand that Lord Cromer has been suffering from an utter nervous
                        breakdown of the alimentary system, and that a complete rest and change of
                        climate were considered absolutely necessary to ensure his recovery. We are
                        glad to be able to state that there are no symptoms of any organic disease
                        and we hope that Lord Cromer's retirement, however sad an event to Egypt,
                        will have the desired results and restore to health the greatest of living
                        Englishmen and a statesman to whom the New Egypt owes its being.</p>

                    <p>Tho announcement of Lord Cromer's resignation has been received with profound
                        regret on all hands. Both the Liberal and Conservative Press join in
                        extolling his magnificent, work in Egypt, and lament the fact that
                        ill-health compels him to relinquish it, this being universally accepted as
                        the reason for his resignation.</p>

                            Arabs returned to work, and the strike, which started on March 29 may
                            now be considered to have ended. The men have returned to work on the

                        <p>An agreement has, I think, been entered into by the masters and sheikhs,
                            by which the labourers will gain a little. It is certain, however, that
                            as far as the masters are concern­ed they will pay, the same rate for
                            discharg­ing viz F.l 00 p8r ton as before the strike.</p>

                    <p>ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.</p>
                    <p>The annual general meeting of the share- holders of the National Bank of
                        Egypt was held yesterday afternoon at Cairo. The Balance sheet and profit
                        and loss account for the year ending the 31st December last were submitted
                        to the shareholders and approved, The Governor of the Bank, Mr. Rowlate,
                        made the following speech : — Gentlemen,</p>
                    <p>Again this year I have the sad duty of alluding to the death of one of the
                        most distinguished members of the Board. In the person of M. Felix Suares
                        the Bank has lost one of its most capable and careful pilots. Not only the
                        Bank but I may say all the community here have lost in him a sincere friend
                        and sound adviser. Your board have elected in his place his son, M. Leon
                        Suarfis whose - nomination we ask you to confirm.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the balance-sheet you have in your hands we propose to pay a
                        dividend of 9% as against 8% last year which we trust you will consider
                        satisfactory- The high rates of interests that have been the feature of the
                        money markets during the last several months have largely accounted for this
                        increase.</p>
                    <p>The banknotes circulation has continued to increase most satisfactorily. On
                        the 31st December, 1906, the circulation was L.R 2 171.226, as against LE. 1
                        389 000 on 30th December 1905. At the present moment the circulation is L.E.
                        2.672.000. In this connection the more the public makes use of our notes,
                        the less will be the temporary inconvenience, owing to the time required for
                        the importation of gold.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the general prosperity of the country and the continuous development
                        of our siness we shall be asking you this year to increase our nominal
                        capital again by LStg. 5000,000.</p>
                    <p>Our relations with the Egyptian Government during the past year have
                        continued to be most satisfactory and we hope shortly to submit for your
                        approval an alteration in our statutes establishing us as the State Bank of
                        tho Egyptian Government</p>
                    <p>Finally we have to thank all our staff for their capable and conscientious
                        assistance during the last year.</p>

                    <p>The boom in the Lancashire cotton industry shows no signs of abating. In
                        fact, the past three months has been one of the most prosper­ous periods on

                        been realised. [</p>
                    <p>A number of concerns do not issue balance- sheets, but where figures are
                        available the profit works out at about 35 per cent, per annum on the share
                        capital. In most cases the dividend paid is at the rate of 10 per cent per
                        addum.</p>
                    <p>On the whole, the position of spinners is well-maintained, and the margin of
                        profit between the raw cotton and the finished yam is wide and

                    <p>LORD CROMER'S SUCCESSOR.</p>
                    <p>The appointment of Sir Eldon Gorst as the new Diplomatic Agent and Coosa'
                        General at Cairo has two great merits, in as much as he is thoroughly
                        acquainted with Egypt and is an extremely able man. Moreover since 1904 he
                        has been a permanent official at the Foreign Office and has had the good
                        fortune to have served as Assistant Under Secretary of State for Foreign
                        Affaire under both a Conservative and Liberal Chief of the Foreign Office,
                        so he will be able to command to the full the support of the home
                        authorities, and his selection has the fortunate character of being in no
                        sense a party appointment. Sir Eldon is the son of the Rt. Hon. Sir John
                        Gorst and of the daughter of the Rev. Lorenzo Moore, of Christ Church, New
                        Zealand. Sir Eldon was born in the Antipodes on the 25th June, 1861, when
                        his father held the post of Civil Commissioner at Waikato. He was educated
                        at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as twentieth
                        wrangler, his father having been third wrangler. On leaving the University
                        he entered the Diplomatic Service and has held the following ranks: Attache,
                        1885, third Secretary, 1887, second Secretary, 1892, See rotary of Legation,
                        1901. He came to Egypt in 1890 and was appointed Controller of Direct Taxes
                        and Undersecretary of State for Fin­ance in 1892. Two years later he became
                        Ad­viser to the Ministry of the Interior and succeeded -the late. Sir Elwin
                        Palmer as Financial Adviser in September 1898, his post, at the Interior
                        being filled by Captain Machell. He continued to hold this post until 1904
                        when he joined the Foreign Office as Assistant Under-Secretary. He married
                        Evelyn, the daughter of Mr. C. D. Rudd, of Ardhamburschan, N.B., in 1903 and
                        has resided in London at Queen Anne's Gate.</p>
                    <p>It is worth noting as showing the unex­pectedness of Sir Eldon Gorst's
                        appointment that on Friday last it was announced in the London Press that he
                        would be appointed one of the three British members of the Anglo-French
                        Commission on the subject of the New Hebrides, which is shortly to meet</p>

                    <p>M. DE FERAUDY.</p>
                    <p>M. de Feraudy made his first appearance last night (Wednesday) as Isidore
                        Lechat in "Les Affaires sent les Affaires." This part he created in Paris,
                        and he has made it his own. His thorough perception of its-full meaning, his
                        entire grasp of every least shade of Lechat's character—the rather brutal,
                        unscrupulous self- made millionaire, ambitious beyond bounds, as proud in
                        his way of his great position and wealth, as were those old nobles for whom
                        he has so supreme a contempt—his diction, gestures, expression, combine in a
                        formidable and memorable presentment, living, sordid if you will, but
                        impressive and terribly true. He over shadows the rest, of course, but then
                        Mirbeau threw them into the background Mine Lechat is simply a 'bonne
                        femme'— hardly even bourgeoise. Germaine is a hard strained creature, her
                        ideas are hopelessly quixotic, except that she makes allowance for no one
                        She has no sense of pity or pardon for the strong Mine Marie Fanre (who
                        ap­peared in Mme Braude's tour as did M Gournao and M Comply) was quite
                        good, but inclined to the superior "bourgeoise"character. Mile Van Doren was
                        quite admirable as Germaine and used voice and expression with the fullest
                        possible effect; she even accentuated the fact at times. The others were all
                        suitable, and in harmony, with the play Only, M. Severin might have made
                        more of Xavier, who should be entirely penchalant and contemptuous, without
                        a trace of enthusiasm The play is a fine piece of work in itself, that rich
                        man, ever a fighter, not without a certain grandeur in his force and power
                        of rebound after every disaster, is contrasted throughout with the old
                        regime, who live by principle. He alone is keen of sight to perceive that
                        their fortunes, their honour, were built equally on blood oppression. They
                        had the corvee, the high, the middle and the low justice, the droit de
                        Seigneur, and many another fierce tort re shrouded in the dusk of their
                        history It is Germaine who utterly fails to see this who is revolted at the
                        credo externals, and cannot comprehend far leas admire or respect her
                        father's real strength. His 'intendant' is a decayed noble was he not ruined
                        through his own fault: Pherich and Gruggh are his victims, worthy scientists
                        of ability Had not they broken Bruneau Were they not starching to break and
                        exploit him ! One may hate Lechat but one must set against his evil aspects
                        the strength and broad views of the man, even the detail of his evident, if
                        rude, affection for Garraud, his natural contempt for weaklings, who are or
                        may be what be was—and left, such might have been a knight's contempt for
                        those less heroic fighters who failed to win their spurs- All this M. de
                        Feraudv and Mile Van Doren revealed to us in its uncompromising reality,
                        unforgiving and unforgiven, a fine interpretation of a fine play.</p>

                    <p>The "Standard" has obtained the opinions of a number of well-known
                        Anglo-Egyptians with regard to Lord Cromer's proposals for the formation of
                        an International Legislative Council.</p>
                    <p>Sir Edgar Vincent, who occupied the position of Financial Adviser to the
                        Egyptian Govern­ment between the years 1883 and 1889, was seen by one of our
                        representatives at Esher Place, Surrey, but was reluctant to speak decidedly
                        on the matter. There is always a difficulty in criticising a country which
                        you have not seen for 16 years," he said. Agreed, however, that Egypt was
                        fairly stable in her history. "You may say this," he added. "There can be no
                        question that the antiquated system of the Capitulations is altogether
                        unsuited to the present condition of Egypt. It does little to secure the
                        interests of Europeans, and it is often a great obstacle in the way of
                        reforms desired by the Egyptian Government and by the Egyptian people.</p>
                    <p>"The division of the people of Egypt into two classes-foreigners, who have
                        privileges and native born Egyptians, who have none—is undoubtedly
                        responsible for the feeling of in­equality which has given rise to the
                        so-called Nationalist movement. Lord Cromer's plan appears to me to meet the
                        ease with fairness and impartiality. The foreign communities now- under
                        consular protection, would gain rather than lose by this scheme, as they
                        would have a more influential, voice in the direction of Government affairs
                        than is now the case. The authority of Lord Cromer in all matters Egyptian
                        is so great that, apart from the merits of the plan, any plan put forward
                        under his authority (deserves the earnest support of England and the careful
                        consideration of all the European Powers interested in Egypt. It is absurd
                        to suppose that Lord Cromer, in putting forward his suggestion, has been
                        influenced by any temporary display of feeling on the part of certain
                        agitators, or by anything than his mature judgment as to what is best in the
                        permanent interests of the country and the legitimate protection of foreign
                        interests engaged in Egypt"</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Sydeny Peel, who has had land and intimate connection with Egypt, is
                        a director of the National Bank of Egypt, and author of "The Binding of the
                        Nil 'and the New Sudan," who was also seen said: "I would not presume to
                        criticise any proposal by the Earl of Cromer : I would follow, him
                        blindfold. I have seen enough of Egypt and the Egyptians, and I know enough
                        of Lord Cromer to enable me to say that, without reservation Lord Cromer is
                        not a man who makes proposals hastily and with a light heart It is hardly
                        fair to ask me to be more specific in appreciation of the recommendations of
                        a man the soundness of whose policy I pro­foundly trust, as I have not yet
                        had an oppor­tunity of mastering the text of his report You say it is
                        believed in some quarters that his hand has been forced by the Nationalists
                        in Egypt who a few weeks ago held a large meeting and clamoured for a
                        National As­sembly. Well, I do not believe in anything of the sort. He is
                        not the sort of man likely to be forced by agitators or flurried by
                        alarmists.</p>
                    <p>I may venture to say that I have never known a people more absolutely,
                        unfitted for par­liamentary institutions than the Egyptians "</p>
                    <p>"But an international council would be quite a different affair?"</p>
                    <p>"Exactly, and whatever Lord Cromer says on that point I should be inclined to
                        accept. More than that, I should think that he had carefully thought out his
                        proposals, and, without having gone carefully into them, I am prepared, as I
                        have indicated, to receive them as full of ripe wisdom."</p>
                    <p>So far as it was possible to gather yesterday the Nationalist movement in
                        Egypt is not taken with very great seriousness by authorities best versed in
                        Egyptian affairs, nor is it considered that Lord Cromer has gone out of his
                        war to formulate a new scheme of Government to checkmate the aspirations of
                        the Nationalists.</p>
                    <p>Sir Benjamin Stone, M.P, who has just returned from a tour in Egypt, was
                        interviewed at his residence, at Erdington, with reference to Lord Cromer's
                        proposals. Sir Benjamin Stone said: "I think that Lord Cromer's proposal of
                        a local international legislative couucil would be conducive to stability in
                        financial matters, and to the more expeditious conduct of business than by
                        the more tardy process of diplomacy. It is therefore to be hoped that he
                        will be supported in this matter.</p>

                        that at the request of the German Minister M Klobukowski, the French

                        the ceremony at the English Church was conducted by Canon Strange. The bride
                        was given away by her brother-in-law Mr. F: Marx, and Mr. J. F. Clemow acted
                        as best man.</p>

                        wedding present. After the usual loyal toasts, the President of the Mess in
                        a few well chosen words expressed the regret felt at the loss of so good a
                        sportsman and companion, but the inevitable darts of Cupid had conquered,
                        and consequently he had the pleasure of presenting to Mr. Toms a token of
                        their regard, and wished him every happiness in the new phase of life's
                        journey on which he was so soon to embark. Mr. Toms in reply sincerely
                        thanked the members for their kindness and hoped it would not be an
                        occa­sion of parting for any lengthy period he hoped to meet them all in his
                        new home very soon, and in a preternaturally solemn tone exclaimed. "Please
                        do not come before the fifteenth", which evoked a great deal of laughter.
                        During the evening songs were rendered by the Rev. E. H. Blyth, Messrs.
                        Baglehole, Waterfieldm Marshall, and Kime, and the proceedings terminated in
                        a hearty vote of thanks to the Rev. E H. Blyth for his artistic

                    <head>Her Nerves Ruined</head>
                    <p>"So unstrung were my nerves that when anyone came near me I trembled," were
                        the words of Mrs. M. Thorne, 130, Bridge-street West, Hockley, Birmingham,
                        when interview­ed recently. Mrs. Thorne referred to a time when, owing to
                        the loss of one dear to her, such a disastrous change was wrought in her
                        that her nervous system collapsed utterly Her arm became paralysed, and for
                        months she remained helpless. Yet to-day her nerve force has been restored,
                        and sho, is strong of limb, having found now health through the Red, Good
                        Blood supplied by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale Poople.</p>
                    <p>"Everyone said I was dying from anxiety and grief," Mrs. Thorne stated.. "My
                        hands trembled and shook, and I could not rest at any time. This sudden
                        crouble produced such a mental and physical shock that from a healthy wo­man
                        I became a trembling, shattered invalid. My eyes were dim and sunken, and I
                        suffered from acute melancholy and insomnia My appetite not only entirely
                        failed me, but I came to almost abhor food of any kind. I became a fearfully
                        emaciated, and on awakening one morning I, to my great consternation, found
                        that I had lost the use of my right arm, which quivered heavy and useless at
                        my ride. Then the truth flatted across .me — I was</p>
                    <p>"The limb was rubbed for hours at a stretch, without effect, and for months
                        my arm hung helpless. I grew hysterical At the least sound, while my legs
                        were so weal that I simply drag­ged one foot after the other. -</p>
                    <p>"For over ten months I was disabled ; then my mother who, had implicit, faith
                        in Dr William' Pink Pills for Pale People, insisted that I should try then,
                        'Look' she said, pointing to a cose in the (newspapers. 'A man at Wil lesdep
                        has been cured of paralysis by Dr. Wil­liam's Pink Pills.' So a box of these
                        pills was purchased immediately, and I began to take them regularly. After
                        three I tones I felt bright and cheerful, and I was astounded to find that I
                        could enjoy a little food and digest it When I had finished the fifth box my
                        strength began to return. I took exercise without fatigue and- could sleep
                        peacefully at night. The right arm,, however, still hung useless by my side.
                        Con­tinuing with Dr. Williams' Pink Pill I grad, ually experienced a
                        tingling sensation nil over me, only slight at first, but in a few days
                        developing all the symptoms of proper circu­lation of tho blood. By degrees
                        my arm regained power, and I know that I was on the road to recovery. Within
                        three months after taking the first box of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills I had
                        regained perfect health and strength and every sign of paralysis had left me
                        ; in fact my arm ivstronger to-day than it was before my ill-</p>

                        whose lives were blighted by various forms of nervous disorders. Those pills

                <head>RESIGNATION OF LORD CROMER</head>
                <p>After Forty-Nine Years' Service</p>
                <p>SIR ELDON GORST APPOINTED</p>
                <p>Sketch of Lord Cromer's Career</p>
                <cb n="1"/>
                <p>The news of Lord Cromer's resignation was announced in Cairo and Alexandria
                    yesterday afternoon at 6.30 o'clock through the medium of Reuter's Agency, which
                    published tho following announcement:—</p>
                <p>Sir Edward Grey has this afternoon made the following announcement in the House
                    of Commons.</p>
                <p>Lord Cromer has under medical advice, decided that it is necessary for him to
                    resign for reasons of health, and I think it is best that I should read to the
                    House tho telegram received from hiui a fbw days ago.</p>
                <p>"I have arrived at the conclusion that I must ask you to accept my resignation. I
                    have done so after very full consideration and con-ulta- tion with my medical
                    adviser and Sir Stephen Mackenzie, who is here I am most anxious that it should
                    be particularly understood that the reasons which have induced me to take this
                    step are wholly due to the state of my health, and that no political
                    considerations of any kind whatsoever are in any way connect­ed with it. More
                    especially I desire to say that nothing could be more effective or generous than
                    the manner in which the present Govern­ment has supported me. It has been the
                    greatest pleasure to me to serve under you, and it is with extreme regret that I
                    shall break my official connection with you. After spending, however, forty-nine
                    years in the public service, I am thoroughly worn out, and I am really unable to
                    support any longer tho excessive strain which my work here entails. I feel also
                    that I do not possess the health and strength which are necessary to do justice
                    to all the very important interests involved. Both doctors are quite agreed that
                    it is necessary that I should give up the work."</p>
                <p>The news has caused the greatest regret to us and will do so to the House; to me
                    per­sonally, it means more than I can express We have relied and placed our
                    confidence in Lord Cromer, as successive British Govern­ments have done for many
                    year-. Some further correspondence has passed in the hope that Lord Cromer's
                    decision might not be final, but, in view of the fact that the recovery of his
                    health (of which I am glad to think there is the prospect) depends absolutely
                    upon his retirement, we have been obliged to accept his decision.</p>
                <p>There will be other opportunities for dwel­ling more at length upon his work in
                    Egypt, but I should like to say at once that it is the object of his Majesty's
                    Government to maintain that work and to continue the policy which-bos been
                    inspired by him, and of which the most admirable exposition is con­tained in his
                    last Report j st presented to Parliament.</p>
                <p>I do not underrate the difficulty of con­tinuing without him the work which has
                    been so dependent upon him. His retirement from Egypt is the greatest personal
                    loss which the public service of this country could suffer. In the early years
                    of the British occupation, in view of all the difficulties in Egypt and
                    else­where, the success achieved by him would have seemed incredible but for the
                    fact that he accomplished it And, if in later years,, progress has been
                    facilitated by the prestige and confidence which have attached to the
                    occupation, it is by Lord Cromer himself that the prestige and confidence have
                    been creat- d,</p>
                <p>Tho King has approved of tho appoint­ment of Sir Eldon Gorst to the vacancy at
                    Cairo, an appointment which has been made after consultation with Lord Cromer.
                    Sir Eldon Gorst has special knowledge of Egypt; there is no one who has
                    possessed to a greater degree Lord Cromer's confidence or has been more closely
                    associated with him personally in his work, and I am confident that this choice
                    is the one best calculated to maintian and continue it.</p>
                <p>The biography of such a ruler of men will some day he a fascinating study, but it
                    cannot be written now. The greater part of a diplomatist's work lies beneath the
                    surface and cannot be dug up till the matter of his negotiations has become
                    ancient history. The following details will, however, help to give our readers
                    an, outline of his origin and career.</p>
                <p>THE BARING FAMILY.</p>
                <p>The family of Baring, originally of German extraction, but for now two centuries
                    domi­ciled and naturalized citizens of England has for more than half that long
                    period been conspicuous in the world of British commerce, finance, and politics.
                    Its founder, John, son of Franz Baring, a Lutheran minister of Bremen, came to
                    England in the year 1697, and established himself as a merchant and cloth manu-
                    facturer at Larkbeer, in Devon hire. His son Francis, horn at that place in
                    174", was sent to London to study commerce under a leading firm of city
                    merchants Though deaf from his youth, his indomitable energy enabled him to
                    overcome all obstacles, and to establish his business oanthe surest foundationa
                    He prospered exceedingly and, had risen to wealth and <cb n="2"/> importance by
                    the time he had reached middle age. Towards the end of the century, when Pitt
                    had determined to strengthen the titled Orders with an infusion of new blood
                    from the middle classes, Francis Baring was a personage of sufficient prominence
                    in the com­mercial world to have become a natural object of the Minister's
                    selection. The baronetcy he obtained was the first of a series of distinctions
                    attained by a family which, during the last sixty years, has added no fewer than
                    four new titles to the roll of Peers. </p>
                <p>Alexander, second son of tho first Baronet, was created Lord Ashburton in 1835.
                    Thomas, grandson of Sir Francis, was raised to tho Peerage in 1866 as Baron
                    Northbrook, a dignity exchanged in 1876 for the Earldom now held by his son, the
                    distinguished states­man who in the last-mentioned year concluded his term of
                    office as Viceroy of India. In 1885 another of Sir Francis's grandsons, Edward
                    Charles Baring, was created Lord Revelstoke ; and in 1892 his younger brother
                    Evelyn com­pleted for the present the list of the family honours by his
                    elevation to the Peerage under the title of Lord Cromer—</p>
                <p>EARLY YEARS.</p>
                <p>Evelyn Baring was born on February 26th, 1611, the sixth child of his father
                    Henry Baring's second marriage. From his mother, a daughter of Vice-Admiral
                    Windham, and a woman of high culture, moving in a brilliant literary society of
                    which George Grote the historian and Arthur Helps were members, he himself
                    derived that marked literary bias of which those who enjoy his intimacy are so
                    often and in so many ways reminded. After a year or two at a preparatory school,
                    kept by Rev. Bickmore, he was transferred to the Ordnance School at Carshalton,
                    the well-known training seminary for the scientific branches of the army. Thence
                    be migrated at the age of thirteen to Woolwich Academy and passed out into the
                    Artillery in 1858 in his eighteenth year</p>
                <p>His military career was uneventful as the two great opportunities for active
                    service during the middle years of the last century— the Crimean War and Indian
                    Mutiny—had route and gone. Early in the sixties he was A.D.C. to Major-General
                    Sir Henry Knight Storks in the Ionian Islands, which were then on the eve of
                    being handed over to the nation to whose commercial qualities tribute was paid
                    in the speech to which reference has just been made. In 1866 Lieut Baring was
                    Secretary to the Commission which inquired into the Jamaican rising. In 1868 he
                    was given A captain's rank, and entered the Staff College Between 1872 and 1876,
                    as Private Secretary to his cousin, Lord Northbrook, who succeeded Lord Mayo as
                    Viceroy of India, Captain Baring had exceptionally favourable opportunities for
                    the study of the problems, civil and military, which beset the Government of the
                    great dependency The results of his military studies were embodied in a series
                    of "Staff College Essays" and a translation of a German text-book, which
                    attracted no little attention. In 1875 he was given his majority in "the
                    gunners,' and in 1879, soon after the purchase of the Suez Canal shares by the
                    British Government, he retired from the Army, and took the appoint­ment of
                    Controller-General of the Egyptian Finance with M. de Blignieres.</p>
                <p>The Frenchman, however, complained of the dominant influence of his colleague,
                    and Down­ing Street, utterly oblivious of the fact that Baring was the one man
                    to enhance British in­terests in Cairo, sent him to fill a post that was
                    apparently more in accord with his disposition and previous training—the post of
                    Minister of Finance of India. It was a grave mistake, and one that cast Great
                    Britain the expenditure of ranch treasure and the loss of mamy lives. Had Baring
                    remained in Cairo, the revolt of Arabi Pasha in 188: would probably not have
                    taken place.</p>
                <p>As financial member of the Council in India he left behind him at Calcutta the
                    record of three successive budgets. In 1883 after the de­feat of Arabi, Downing
                    Street wisely saw fit to recall Baring from India and to make him Agent and
                    Consul General. It was thus that Cromer's real diplomatic career in Egypt
                    began.</p>
                <p>At this time Egypt was virtually bankrupt, its administration almost hopelessly
                    corrupt, and its very existence threatened by the forces of fanatinlrtn. Compare
                    this picture with that presented by Egypt and the Sudan to­day. Many men have
                    contributed to tho change, but the motive power behind them all has been Lord
                    Cromer.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to review Lord Cromer's career in Egypt as it would involve
                    giving an accent of the whole course of Egyptian history frura 1883 to the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>LORD CROMER AND GORDON.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting chapters of Lord Cromer's life, when it comes to Ig-
                    written, will be that dealing with b s relation? with Gordon. It is evident that
                    he changed his mind about the employment of Gotdon and Znbeyr and an <cb n="3"/>
                    expedition from Suskin to Berber. How far these changes were due to the
                    vacillations of Downing Street we cannot now tell. Lord Cromer lathe last man in
                    the world to vindicate himself at the expense of his Government, and this
                    century will be far on its way before wo learti the whole truth. We believe that
                    if Lord Cromer, had then possessed the commanding in­fluent which he now exerts,
                    and had firmly pressed a vigorous policy upon Lord Granville, he would have
                    compelled the feeblest of modem Administrations to walk in his path. But one
                    must not forget that he was hardly settled in the saddle when the trouble began,
                    and that his-prestige was then not to be compared with his present reputation.
                    On the whole, we must accept the warm testimony of Sir Henry Gordon to the
                    earnest sympathy and unflagging support accorded to his heroic brother by the
                    English Consul-General.</p>
                <p>PERSONAL TRAITS.</p>
                <p>It is of interest at the present moment to reproduce the following account of his
                    methods of procedure and personal traits contributed by an intimate friend to
                    the late Mr. Traill's life of Lord Cromer</p>
                <p>"The work in Egypt grew upon the English representative, but it was work under
                    imposed conditions. The necessity of fiscal reform was admitted on all sides,
                    but beyond this Lord Cromer was not given a perfectly free band. He was to work
                    on the lines of Lord Dufferin's celebrated despatch, and this documents: pre
                    scribed certain conditions which were attractive on paper but difficult to
                    establish in practice. Lord Dufferin could not boldly place Englishmen at the
                    head of the various departments, but leaving the native Pashas in their high
                    offices he provided each of them with an English Under-Secretary, who was to
                    guide and influence him in his administrative duties. Had each of these
                    subordinates been endowed with the tact or sympathetic dexterity, as well as
                    with the unexampled experience of Lord Dufferin himself, the result might have
                    been successful, but when the Undersecretary was deficient in those gifts
                    friction immediately resulted.</p>
                <p>"However, Lord Cromor had to carry out the programme as best he could with the
                    materials that he found provided for him. One by one he took in hand the various
                    de­partments, and laboured to substitute ordor for chaos, honesty for
                    corruption, and industry for inertness. The hardest task was, and is still, to
                    develop in native officials a sense of responsibility and self-reliance. Timid
                    and suspicious, nurtured in a hot atmosphere of gossip and intrigue, fo-id of
                    subterranean ways and tortuous paths to promotion, the Egyptian &lt;1 d not take
                    kindly to the English rtgime, be cause be did not and could not believe in it He
                    cannot understand even now that hard work, and not backstairs influence, is the
                    pass­port to promotion ' . .</p>
                <p>" His philosophy leads him to take kindly vio'vs of men. Ho likes to think
                    generously of those about him, and ho often says that as ho grows older he
                    think* better of tho rank and fils of humanity than ho did when young All those
                    who have worked under him feel that ho trusts them, and that ho requires at
                    their hands equal candour. He losea no oppor­tunity of praising his subordinates
                    and. of recommending them for promotion i. but ho requires from them staunch and
                    thorough loyalty in return. His attitude towards his men is not unliko that of
                    Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, when ha said that ho mutt have confidence in the
                    Sixth.'</p>
                <p>" l«rd Cromer's resemblance to the great Headmaster is specially shown in bis
                    rela­tion* with tho junior member* of hi* staff. Tho Agency at Cairo is an
                    excellent diplo­matic school. The Chief treats hi* subordinates with perfect
                    frankness, and the result is that he is served with unswerving devotion. Ho
                    requires thoroughness and lird work. Hi* conversation—rich in quotations,
                    historical references, and shrewd criticisms of men and thing* - is full of
                    instruction and stimulating suggestion. Dull indeed must that Secretary bo who
                    does not learn something from the daily talk Lord Cromor pours out over tho
                    luncheon table. In his relations with his ' boys, ' and above all in his happy
                    domestic life, the warmth of heart that underlies the brusquo manner is
                    apparent. For one of the youDg men who was associated with him in the most
                    trying time in his Egyptian career he cheri­shed, as he has himself told us, a
                    fatherly nflection ; and those who law his sorrow at the untimely death of
                    Gerald Portal realized that, like all the other sides of Lord Cromer's
                    character, his aftccticns are strong. There is nothing weak or superficial in
                    the man.</p>
                <p>"Sir Alfred Milnor pointed out wheo sketching the difficulties of the Egyptian
                    problem, that it required above all other things patience; and indeed without
                    this, tact, energy, financial adroitness, and financial ability would iiave
                    availed little. Lord Cromer knows better than most men how to wait without
                    losing time, when it would be inopportune to push one of his chief projects, for
                    which ho never loses a moment, bat tarns aside and put in <cb n="4"/> some
                    smaller Work Which is auxiliary to tho main object. And the name of these tasks
                    is legion. The British Agent and Consul-General is the universal referee, and is
                    applied to by petitioners of every nation, and in all causes ecclesiastical and
                    civil.'</p>
                <p>"In a single morning ho may bo requested to give his verdict on a proposed
                    economy on the Budget, on the dismissal of a postman,-80^ plan for augmenting
                    the Army, on a quarrel between two rival Jewish sects, on tho deporta­tion of a
                    drunken Irishman, on a question of precedence of tho wives of two Egyptian
                    officials, and on the boat method of preserving the remains of a Ptolemaic
                    temple. These add a score of other matter* pass in review before 'the spectacled
                    ejrea,' and are investigated And adjudicated on with a care and thoroughness
                    alike untiring and inexhaustible. And daring six moftths of the year to these
                    multifarious dutios are added social engagements—luncheon parties, dinner
                    partios, and receptions to 'ail and sundry1 who may be furnished with letters of
                    introduction to the Agency—noftomention interviews with journalists and members
                    of Parliament who wish to prove the Occupation, a failure, and projectors whose

                <p>"All these claimants in turn receive ap-s. propristo treatment. They are not sent

                    Undcr-Secretary; each has his claims listened tc{ and he may be sure that if
                    Lord Cromer has promised to write a letter on the matter that letter will be
                    written before the day closes, and in his noxt interview he will find that his
                    proposal has been tho­roughly sifted, and subjected to a glance as penetrating
                    as a search-light.</p>
                <p>LITERARY TASTES.</p>
                <p>"My sketch has shown Lord Cromer as an indefatigable worker. Ho is also an
                    omni­vorous reader, but with a high critical standard. He likes no inferior
                    work. This is largely owing to tho (act that he lays a sound foundation Like
                    Coleridge, he regards tho Bible as the 'Statesman's Manual' Few divines know the
                    Book of Job and the prophecies of Isaiah better; bat though again with
                    Cole­ridge he would say that 'Sublimity is Hebrew by birth,' he begins every day
                    with a page of Greek or Latin authors. Ho loves his Homer. Tho 12th Book ot the
                    Iliad is his favourite, Cicero and Juvenal ho erjoys. His favourite study is
                    history, and his favourite period the French Revolution. Indian questions of
                    course interest him keenly.</p>
                <p>"His knowledge of the English poets is remarkable Dryden's masculine verse
                    attracts, him, but his voluminous nute-bioks contain extraots from writers of
                    every contury. He loves a good novel and enjoys healthy stories, like those of
                    the now romantic schools of novelists; but he never fails to express his
                    loathing of the nauseous fiction of the day, and has been known to put
                    ehancejfound volumes of it into the first fire he coaid find alight</p>
                <p>"Among his favourite passages from the Latin poets may be cited the ndble ljoes

                <p>LORD MILNER'S TESTIMONY.</p>
                <p>Side by side with this nnofficial testimony to the great qualities of the
                    Consul-General let us place the no less admiring estimate formed of im by one of
                    the ablest and most distinguish­ed of the Englishmen who served under him— in
                    fact if not in form—during the darkest end most difficult years of the British
                    Occnpa- lion, and recorded in what has become the standard work on this
                    remarkable chapter in onr history. Sir, Alfred Milner writes (England in Egypt,
                    p. 437) as follows :</p>
                <p>"In the art of government the Englishman seems to lie as handy and adaptable as
                    he is clumsy and angular in society. There are other nations with equal and
                    perhaps greater gifts for the creation of an ideally perfect administration, if
                    they have a tabula rasa wherein to construct ifc But I doubt whether any of them
                    could have made anything at all of a system so imperfect, so inoongruous, and so
                    irritating as that which we found in Egypt, and which <cb n="5"/> we have not
                    been permitted radioally to alter. Tho logical Frenchman would have been
                    mad­dened by its absurdities. The authoritative temper of the German would have
                    revolted ot its restrictions. They would have insisted on governing in their own
                    way, or they would havo despaired of governing at all It needed that incarnation
                    -of compromise, the average Briton, to accept the system with all its faults and
                    set to work, quietly plpdding away to do the beat he could under untoward
                    circnm- I stances.</p>
                <p>| "The qualities of tho race have triumphed I But onr success might have been
                    leas com-; perhaps that success might never have attained at all had iiXTbeen
                    for one remarkable piece of good fortune. The stars were indeed gracious when at
                    the beginning of onr greatest troubles it occurred to the British Governtaent to
                    entrust the conduct of its policy to the hands of Sir Evelyn Baring It would be
                    difficult to overestimate what the work of England in Egypt owes to the
                    sagacity, fortitude, and patience of the.British Minister. His mental and moral
                    equipment—very re­markable in any case—was peculiarly suited to tho veiy
                    peculiar circumstances in which ho fo'.nd himself placed. Perhaps the most
                    striking'feature about him has been a singular combination of strength and
                    forbearance ; and he needed both these qualities in an excep­tional degree. jOu
                    one side of him were the English officials, zealous about their work, fretting
                    at the obstruction which met them every time, and constantly appealing to hi ml
                    for assistance to overcome it. On tho other side were the native authorities,
                    new to our methods, hating to be driven, and keen to resent the appearanco of
                    English diplo­matic pressure. The former were often induoed to grumble at him
                    for interfering too little, the latter were no less. prone to complain of his
                    interfering too much.</p>
                <p>What a task was his to steer an even keel botweon meddlesomeness and inactivity I
                    Yet how soldoih has he failed to hit the right meau. Slowly but surely he has
                    carried all his main points. And he has carried thorn without need- sly
                    overriding native authority or/ pushing his own personality into tho foreground.
                    He has realized that the esseneo of onr policy is-to hel(i the Egyptians to work
                    out as for as possible their own salvation. And net only has no realized this
                    himself, hot he has taught others to realize it."</p>
