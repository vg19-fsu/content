                        <p>Beautiful weather prevailed yesterday until 8 p.m., when there were vivid
                            flashes of lightning in the N.W. and every appearance of an approaching
                            storm. At 8.45 p.m. the weather became squally, with a moderate gale
                            from the N.W. and a rising sea. A heavy shower of rain fell accompanied
                            by heavy peals of thunder and vivid lightning. About midnight there was
                            a flat calm and lightning was seen to the N.E. At 3 a.m. the weather
                            became squally again from the N.W., blowing a moderate gale at times.
                            There was a rough sea, vivid lightning, and frequent heavy showers, the
                            total rainfall being 0.06. The barometer remained steady throughout.</p>

                    <head>REDUCTION OF THE GARRISON.</head>
                    <p>The correspondence which has been filling our cloumns of late on the subject
                        of the reduction of the Army of Occupation is interesting as being in a
                        certain sense a criterion of that somewhat elusive social phenomenon,
                        English public opinion in Egypt. None of the letters, which have appeared
                        from the malcontents, have induced us to depart in the slightest degree from
                        the opinions expressed in our leading article of Saturday week. The
                        statements advanced by this section of our correspondents merit examination
                        in order that the fallacies underlying them may be exposed. It is suggested
                        by both "A Humble Imperialist" and "Old Officer," whose letters appeared in
                        our issues of the 24th and 28th ulto. respectively, that those responsible
                        for the reduction of the garrison are sacrificing military efficiency to
                        electioneering tactics. This is, indeed, a grave allegation. Let us examine,
                        then, the terms in which it is formulated and the grounds upon which it is
                        based. "A Humble Imperialist" writes:– <cb n="6"/>"The wrost thing for the
                        Empire is an Imperial Defence Committee presided over by a party man like
                        the Prime Minister, who would be tempted to put the exigencies of party
                        finance before the true needs of the Empire." In the letter of "Old Soldier"
                        the charge is reiterated with greater particularity. Economy, he tells us,
                        is to-day a more alluring bait to dangle before the British tax-payer – and
                        voter – than efficiency. "To reduce expenses by disbanding some regiments in
                        Great Britain would not appeal much to the man in the street. But to
                        increase the home garrison and at the same time decrease expense, is a
                        valuable electioneering asset. For it mustbe borne in mind that any military
                        unit is less in numbers and cheaper to maintain in England than abroad; en
                        parenthese, it is also less efficient." We have quoted textually the words
                        used by our correspondents in order that it may not be said that we have
                        unfairly represented them. Both writers must be taken to know the facts upon
                        which they evince in the controversy, it must likewise be assumed that they
                        have perused the correspondence which had previously appeared in our
                        columns. Now, we would take leave to inquire for what reason thses gentlemen
                        have thought fir to gloss over a most important factor in this discussion,
                        viz., that Egypt contributes to the maintenance of the British Army of
                        Occupation. It was stated by "An Occasional Correspondent" in our issue of
                        the 22nd ulto. that 84,000 is the annual contribution. We have been at pains
                        to cinsult the estimates for 1904, and we find that the actual amount, as
                        given in the "Stateman's Year Book," is L.E. 84,825. "An Occasional
                        Correspondent," therefore, errs on the right side. It follows, then, as a
                        necessary consequence, that by the withdrawal of 1,800 troops the burden
                        upon the Egyptian Exchequer will be proportionatrly lightened, whilst that
                        upon the British Exchequer will be, caeteris paribus, to an equal extent
                        increased. Where, then is the economy which is to appeal so powerfully to
                        the pockets of the British taxpayer – and voter? "Old Soldier" attempts to
                        bolster up his contention thuswise. "It is cheaper," he says, "to maintain
                        soldiers in England than abroad." Let him prove it. We will not dispute with
                        him on that point because we are without the necessary knowledge, but after
                        what he has written we are not prepared to accept his ipse dixit as
                        conclusive. Let him substantiate, the actual saving to the British Treasury
                        that will be effected by the reduction of the garrison. That is what he has
                        to do to establish this branch of his argument. If he cannot do that, we
                        would recommend him to be more careful in future over his facts before he
                        attributes "unworthy" motives to any amn, least of all to the Government by
                        which he is, or was, employed.</p>
                    <p>We further notice a minor error into which he has fallen but which, all the
                        same, goes to emphasize his general unreliability. He refers to "some two
                        and a half years ago, when the British barracks at Khartoum were finished, a
                        British regiment was needed to garrison that salubrious spot. It was not
                        found possible to spare one from Egypt and one was brought from outside,
                        thus increasing the Army of Occupation by one regiment." Surely, "Old
                        Officer," whose Imperialist solicitude is so over-mastering that he must
                        needs give it vent by censuring in the public Press his present or former
                        superiors, ought to be aware that the Suden is held jointly by the British
                        and Egyptian Governments, and that, therefore, there can be no question of a
                        British Army of Occupation in the sense that the term is understood in
                        Egypt. The further point that both "A Humble Imperialist" and "Old Soldier"
                        endeavour to make only tends to obscure the issue without advancing bu one
                        iota their own contention. They ask us to believe without a title of
                        evidence that this one was out-voted and that would launch us upon a sea of
                        conflicting suppositions. And here we must enter our protest against such a
                        method of canvassing official opinions from which one may happen to dissent.
                        Nothing could be more mischievous than to attempt to impugn the decision of
                        the authorities by the insidious suggestion, based admittedly upon pure
                        surmise, that they were not in agreement, but that military counsels were
                        over-ridden by party considerations. We prefer, and we trust that we shall
                        carry the majority of our readers with us, to credit our Imperial Defence
                        Committee with honourable intentions and patriotic conduct, rather than to
                        suspect its members, without a shred of proof, of being traitorous political
                        time servers.</p>

                    <p>Although the cotton season here this year is very late and poor, our
                        Moudirieh is already without silver. One wonders what it would have been if
                        the season had turned out a good one. Since last spring I have been hearing
                        of large consignments of silver arriving from England and Germany. Where has
                        it all gone to? The Government should see that an ample supply is provided
                        for the public'c requirements. I presume we shall soon see the "sarrafs"
                        charging P.T. 2 or P.T. 3 for changing a soversign, as last year.</p>

                    <head>MOTOR TRACTION FOR CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:– I notice in the Gazette of this evening an
                        interesting paragraph on the subject of motor omnibuses for Cairo. I learn
                        on very good authority that the Egyptian Government would be very pleased to
                        entertain any proposition for such an innovation. The present progress of
                        Cairo demands an efficient omnibus service. The Capital is increasing in all
                        diractions. The traffic is enormous to what it was in recent years. The
                        other day I counted 103 carriages crossing Kasr-el-Nil Bridge, returning
                        from the promenade, in only seven minutes. From enquiries I have made I
                        learn that this is a dailt occurrence. The introduction of motors both for
                        omnibus and transport purposes would greatly alleviate the present pressure
                        and also prevent much unnecessary cruelty to animals. There is no better
                        managed society than the S.P.C.A. of Cairo, the infirmary of which I learn
                        well repay a visit, but from what I learn the S.P.C.A. is powerless in the
                        great majority of cases to effect any remedy owing to the Capitulations. I
                        think a word of praise is due to the police for the admirable way in which
                        they control the trafic in Cairo, including that of the motor cars, which in
                        European cities are so difficult to deal with. Judging from this I should
                        say that the introduction of motor omnibuses would in no way prove an
                        additional source of ambarasment to the police or danger to the public.</p>

                    <head>NIAM-NIAM EXPEDITION.<lb/>OBJECT OF THE PATROL.</head>
                    <p>As very exaggerated reports have recently appeared in the British Press as to
                        the proposed despatch of a patropl into the Southern Bahr-el-Ghazal, it is
                        desirable that the correct facts should be made public.</p>
                    <p>This measure was decided upon a year ago, the object in view being the
                        establishment of certain necessary Government posts and the further
                        settlement of the country.</p>
                    <p>It is hoed that no resistance will be offered, but the patrol is strong
                        enough to deal with any of the more turbulent chiefs, should they prove
                        hostile.</p>
                    <p>The numbers and scope of the patrol are seriously misstated in the Press
                        reports. The present is by no means the first patrol which has been
                        despatched, such minor operations having been frequently undertaken in order
                        to establish the Government, and rather to prevent the outbreak of
                        hostilities by a timely display of strength than to provoke any collision
                        with the local tribes.</p>

                        Sublime Porte his opposition to the continuation of the railway to Mecca. At
                        most he agrees to the line being prolonged to Medina. On the other hand, the
                        line will not be extended beyond Maan in the meantime. From this last point
                        a branch is to be constructed to join the Akaba Gulf. If this plan be
                        carried out Turkey will possess an open door to Egypt. England is not likely
                        to accept such a solution without reluctance, and will probably seek for
                        compensation in Yemen or in the Hedjaz.</p>

                        stone's throw of Shepheard's Hotel is still continued almost nightly, and,
                        naturally, with the same inevitable result of finding no gamblers nor
                        gambling, for as soon as Captain quartier, the chief of the secret police
                        service, accompanied by the kawass of the Hellenic Consulate, is seen
                        approaching, his arrival is at once made known by the employes guarding the

                        nothing in the shape of a roulette wheel is to be seen.</p>
                    <p>Both we and our confreres in the Capital have, at different periods, called
                        attention to this grave scandal, and it was hoped that when stringent

                        months ago regarding this matter there would have been a change. Instead of
                        this, however, we find that the largest of these gambling-dens, after
                        remaining closed for a few weeks, has reopened its doors and is frequented
                        nightly by its customary habitues.</p>

                    <p>The first performance of L'Elisir d'Amore was given last night. The
                        interpretation of the opers was very good, especially as regards the
                        orchestra and the female choruses, some of the members of which possess very
                        fresh voices. The tenor Zonghi sang well, more especially in the famous
                        romance in the 3rd act. The baritone Badini and the comic bass Bordogni were
                        excellent, while the light soprano at time distinguished herself. The opera
                        did not attract a large audience; it is too old to please modern tastes. The
                        music is spiritless, and the development of the piece is based on the
                        conventional. The sweet and spirited melody which distinguished Donizetti's
                        other operas is somewhat lacking here.</p>

                        by Lord Cromer and the official of the Public Works Department, besides the
                        Free State Lands Department of the Finance Ministry. Egypt's greatest need
                        at present is the creation of an Agricultural Department. At the present
                        time the position of affairs is ridiculous. The Finance Ministry controls
                        the Free State Lands Department, the Ministry of the Public Instruction is
                        at the head of the School of Agriculture, the Veterinary Department is under
                        the Sanitary Administration, Irrigation is subject to the Public Works
                        Department, the Khedivial Agricultural Society is dependent on and regulated
                        by the Finance Ministry, and thus the entire administrative direction of
                        Egyptian agriculture is in a hopeless state of disorganisation owing to
                        there being no real head. At the present time the Government is creating new
                        official posts and is increasing the slalries of the more favoured
                        officials, but there is no sign that any of the surplus funds now placed at
                        the disposal of the authorities will be devoted to the creation of an
                        Agricultural Department. If we want any agricultural statistics we have to
                        go to the Alexandria General Produce Association's reports. Yet it would be
                        quite easy to organise such a Department, for we have many excellent men who
                        could be selected for the position of chief of the Department. Mr. Foster,
                        the managing director of the Behera Company, would be an ideal man for the
                        job. His great experience in the service of the Egyptian Government, and his
                        achievements as director of the fortunes of the Behera Company, are
                        sufficient qualifications. Again, there is Mr. Lang Anderson, the managing
                        director of the Aboakir Company. His success as a most capable and energetic
                        agriculturist is known throughout the length and breadth of Egypt. Mr.
                        Foaden, the able secretary of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, would be a
                        very suitable sub-director of the new Department, owing to his techincal
                        knowledge. The newly-appointed chemist to the Agricultural Society, Mr.
                        Hughes, and the entomologist, Mr. Willcocks, would be useful men on the
                        staff. Mr. Monson would also have been a good man for the staff, but as he
                        is devoting hinself to his own syndicate his services are not available.
                        There are, however, other names, which I could suggest, but I do not wish to
                        trespass at two great length on your valuable space. One of the first duties
                        of such a Department would be to infuse new life into the School of
                        Agriculture at Ghizeh, which is doing very little good at present time. The
                        Veterinary Department is greatly handicapped at the present time owing to
                        its connection with the Sanitary Administration. If placed under a
                        Department of Agriculture its uses would be developed many times over. In
                        fact, the capacity for good, which such a Department would possess, will be
                        incalculable, and the sooner such an administration is created, the better
                        it will be for Egypt.</p>

                    <p>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector-General of Irrigation in Lower
                        Egypt, and formely in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>(Continued.)</p>
                    <p>If, in the future, a summer supply is obtained from storage reservois
                        constructed on the Blue Nile or its affluents, the barrage and canals would
                        serve to distribute it as efficiently as the winter water.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the river and land levels at the proposed barrage site, no
                        information is given beyond the folowing:– </p>
                    <p>"The average height of the banls over summer water level is from 9 to 11 m.
                        for the first 250 kiloms. upstream of Khartoum. Further south they rise and
                        average over 10 to 12m. above low-water level. The difference in level
                        between flood and summer is from 8 to 9m."</p>
                    <p>"A study of the (Khartoum) gauge registers shows that the highest range was
                        8.06 m. in 1869, and the lowest was 5.20 m. in 1877. Also that, as a rule,
                        although this is not abosolute, the range of the Blue Nile in years of high
                        flood is over 7 m., and of a low one below 6m. The range for 1903 was only
                        6.46 m., while for 1874 and 1878, both years of disastrous flood, the range
                        at Khartoum was 7.20 m. and 7.51 m. respectively."</p>
                    <p>The water slope of the Blue Nile at Khartoum is given as 1/112000 in the
                        flood season. As we are told that the banks rise higher above low water
                        level as one goes south, we may assume that the natural ground slope 1/19000
                        or 10cm. per kilo. If the canals are given a water surface slope of 1/20000
                        the water level will be nearer country level by 5 cm. for every kilom. of
                        distance from the head. If we assume 10m. as the height of the country above
                        low water – the barrage site being within 250 kiloms. of Khartoum – and that
                        the barrage holds up 6 m. head, the water surface in the head of the canal
                        will be 4 m. below soil. As the water slope gains 5 cm. a kilom. over the
                        country slope, the water will come to the surface in 80 kiloms. But by
                        regulation, or by adpoting a flatter water surface slope, this length could
                        be reduced to 50 kiloms. or 60 kiloms. Here we have the identical problem
                        which faced Ismail Pasha's engineers, who were called upon to provide for
                        the irrigation of the Khedive's sugar-cane estates in Middle Egypt alongside
                        a chain of basins; a problem they solved without the help of a barrage on
                        the river, as the existence of the corvee or unpaid labour system overcame
                        the difficulty of want of ready money to pay for the large cubes of
                        earthwork to be excavated. They dug the Ibrahimieh Canal with a head open to
                        the river, and at Derut, 63 kiloms. from the head at Assiout, they
                        constructed regulators to distribute the water between the basin feeders and
                        the perenially flowing canals. The barrage and Ibrahimieh Canal head at
                        Assiout, lately constructed, complete the scheme, which it is now suggested
                        might serve as a model for a Blue Nile project.</p>
                    <p>Let us now consider how the proposed canals would work in flood. The rise of
                        a mean flood is about 6 metres, and with such a rise and the barrage fully
                        open, the same sonditions as regards levels would be produced as a low water
                        when the barrage is holding up 6 m. If the natural flood fails to rise 6 m.,
                        it can easily be made to do so by regulating on the barrage, as it has been
                        shown by actual practice that regulation during flood is safe. The Assiout
                        barrage in the flood of 1902 held up 1.50 m., and the Delta Barrage held up
                        still more.</p>

                    <head>THE STATE OF HELOUAN.<lb/>THE ROADS.</head>
                    <p>Owing to the complaints we have received from the residents at Helouan on the
                        subject of the way that important health resort is neglected by the Public
                        Works Department and the Sanitary Administration, a representative of the
                        Gazette paid a visit to Helouan to see if these complaints were justified.
                        The main grievances, it appears, are the water supply, the bad roads, the
                        inefficiency of the local Municipal Commission, and the neglect of the
                        Tanzim Department. The grievances are all justified and Helouan appears to
                        have a good grounds for accusing the authorities of very great neglect.</p>
                    <p>There are only two roads outside the town, one leading to the Wady Hof and
                        the other to the Nile. These are the only roads where visitors and the
                        inhabitants can drive. The Nile road is very important, as it is the sole
                        means of communication between Helouan and the Ghizeh province. This roas is
                        in a deplorable condition. A few days ago the Tanzim Department made a
                        slight effort to improve it. The sand of the roas, but whenever a strong
                        eind comes it will all be blown back again on to the road. The road is lower
                        than the surroungind desert and, consequently, becomes a receptacle for all
                        the sand; whenever ther is any wind, the dust is carried on to the raod and
                        makes it impassable.</p>
                    <p>The attempts of the Tanzim Department to temporarily improve the road by
                        removing the sand to the sides are quite ineffectual, and merely lead to a
                        waste of labour and money as the road is mot made any better by such
                        expedients. The road ought to be thoroughly taken in the hand and the whole
                        surface ahould be raised about three feet above the desert. </p>
                    <p>The surface of the road is full of holes, and the only system which the
                        Tanzim Department pursues, is to put big stones into the holes, which makes
                        driving and riding both dangerous and unpleasant. The strain on the horses
                        is very great and the donkeys and mules, which take stones, etc., to the
                        Nile, suffer greatly.</p>
                    <p>Two years ago, after several complaints had been made by some consuls in
                        Cairo, whose subjects were interested in Helouan, the Tanzim Department
                        spent about L.E. 1,000 for the purpose of repairing the worst parts of the
                        track, which runs from the native village to-wards the river. The work was
                        excellently done, but since then the road has been utterly abandoned. It is
                        never watered nor swept and unless something is done soon, it will relapse
                        into its former state. The expenditure of 24 per annum would have sufficed
                        to keep tat part of the road in good condition. A sakkha with a ghirbeh
                        could take the water from the canal running along the side of the road and
                        water it daily at very little expense. As it is now, the Tanzom Department
                        has wasted this 1,000 because it never took any pains, after it had spent
                        the money, to see that the road was kept in decent order.</p>
                    <p>The Wady Hoff road, which is the only route to the hills, and affords a
                        charming excursion for visitors, is equally neglected.</p>
                    <p>The Governement does not attempt to improve this state of affairs, and,
                        whenever the Local Commission is approached, the only reply given is "Mafish
                        felous." Of course, as the budget of the Commission consists of a miserable
                        pittance of L.E. 1,500 per annum, not much can be expected, as the lighting
                        of the town and the upkeep and watering of the roads, including all repairs,
                        have to be undertaken out this amount. The Moudirieh of Ghizeh has not
                        one-half of the superficies of roadway that Helouan has, yet the budget of
                        that moudirieh for roads only is about ten times the budget of Helouan. As
                        the local Commission can do nothing owing to poverty, the Governemnt ought
                        to seriously take the question in hand and a grant ought to be given to the
                        Tanzim Department for that purpose.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,– This morning I saw a lady off by the 11.15 train to Mansourah. She
                            had a second-class ticket. I asked the "farash" to find a ladies'
                            compartment, which he did. It was occupied by two negresses, who had
                            covered the seats with bundles of clothes, goulas, eggs, cheese, and
                            other kinds of lumber. On applying to the proper person and pointing out
                            that it was impossible for a European lady to travel with such dirty
                            people, I was told there was no remedy, as this was the "Egyptian
                            fashion."</p>
                        <p>Seeing the railway is run by Englishmen, this "Egyptian fashion" should
                            be done away with. Surely a separate ladies' compartment for ladies
                            travelling alone should be provided. There are many English ladies who
                            cannot afford first-class fares, and it would be very easy to have a
                            second-class compartment labelled "European ladies only." It also very
                            often happens that women of very doubtful character travel in the
                            second-class compartment reserved for ladies.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,– I find housekeeping in Egypt most worrying and difficult, and I am
                            sure I should not be the only grateful housewife, if you would publish
                            in your valuable paper a list, monthly, of things that are to be in
                            season, and the prices of them. I am almost certain my cook does not
                            spend the money I give him, and that the prices he says he gives for the
                            things are often double the actual cost. Not only this (which I don't
                            mind if he provides enough for the different meals) but I get no change
                            of food; the same thing day after day. For instance, I have had "French
                            beans" as a second vegetable and "dates" for desert very much oftener
                            than I care about.</p>
                        <p>When I remonstrate with him, he says there is nothing else in the
                            "market," and as I do not know, and have no means of finding out, I
                            cannot contradict him. I am sure if you would do this would be a boon to
                            the English housekeeper in Egypt. Perhaps some of your readers would
                            help you with the list, especially those who have lived out here a
                            number of years, and are acquainted with the "dodges" of the native
                            cook.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,– I am glad that you defended Super intendent Lynn from criticism of
                            La Reforme. Like yourself, I watched the fire and was in dread of a
                            great extension. I was amazed at the rapidity with which the fire, which
                            was blazing out of several windows, was overcome. So pleased was I that,
                            though a stranger to Mr. Lynn, I recognised by his accent in giving
                            orders that he was a "Brither Scot" and could not refrain frompersonally
                            congratulating him on his energy and skill. </p>
                        <p>If a visitor may be excused from gently offering a suggestion, it would
                            be that simultaneous with the Brigade the police ought to arrive, as
                            there was little attempt at controlling the crowd, and Mr. Lynn and
                            staff were most unfairly handicapped in getting their hoses through the
                            dense mass of people.</p>
                        <p>I noticed with interst and pleasure a gentleman, extremely well dressed,
                            who, I learn, was a Mr. Barker of your city and who, amid the mud,
                            sparks, and water, was very energetic, and by his means several hoses
                            were playing a few minutes sooner than they otherwise would.</p>

                    <p>FOOTBALL.</p>
                    <p>56th FIELD BATTERY ROYAL ARTILLERY</p>
                    <p>Versus</p>
                    <p>RAILWAY INSTITUTE, BOULAC.</p>
                    <p>This match was played on the Railway Institute ground on Boulac on Friday
                        afternoon before an enthusiastic crowd of spectators. The Institute won the
                        toss and McColl elected to play with the sun in his favour. The Artillery
                        kicked off and the ball travelled towards the Artillery goal. Simmons
                        centred to Cory and the Artillery were soon forced to give a corner.
                        However, nothing resulted and the ball was sent again up the field, but Bell
                        played finely and passing to Smith, that player shot at goal, missing by a
                        very small margin. Gunner Topcott returned the ball into play, and after
                        some neat footwork Smith centred to Cory, who beat Gunner Topcott, the
                        Artillery custodian, scoring the only goal of the day. On play being resumed
                        Bell gave a fine exhibition of back play. Wheeler Williams, ever ready to
                        tackle his man, was baffled repeatedly. Hands was given against the
                        Artillery when the home goal was in danger, the free kick saved the goal for
                        a short time only. The Artillery backs played well and their forwards
                        getting too eager, Referee Mr. J. Trotter blew his whistle for off-side.
                        Esan was very soon in evidence. He kicked the ball neatly over his shoulder
                        to Smith, and that player at once returned it to him after dodging Driver
                        Campbell. Esan and Smith did some neat passing, and eventually Smith shot at
                        goal, just going outside, the ball grazing the post. The artillery now were
                        playing a strong hard game. Bombardier Sales, Gunner Mayhew, and Driver
                        Campbell showed some fine combination work; they fed each other well, and
                        but for Bell's good kicking and tackling, would have been very dangerous.
                        Bell, getting the ball at his feet, ran well up the field and saved his
                        forwards by a well placed kick, the ball going well into Artillery quarters.
                        However, the Artillery men were not to be denied: they worked the ball back
                        again, only to be foiled once more by McColl and Bell. The Artilery backs
                        (Bombardier Pike and Wheeler Williams) played a sterling game and were ever
                        on the ball. Gunner Topcott saved his charge from the shots which poured
                        into his goal mouth until half-time. Half-time score: Institute 1, Artillery
                        0.</p>
                    <p>On resuming, play became fast and the ball sped away to the Artillery goal,
                        where Hayes shot the ball over the bar, when standing in front of the
                        Artillery goal. Esan was now seen to advantage; he forced a corner from
                        Gunner Lungsden, but the back division cleared the Artillery goal,
                        Bombardier Pike, S.O. Edwards and Gunner Lungsden combining to work the ball
                        out of danger.McColl, getting possession of the leather, ran up the field
                        and passes to Smith, who at once shot at goal, missing by a fractional part
                        of an inch. The game now was very quick, Esan and Simmons shooting at goal
                        in quick succession, but Gunner Topcott saved his charge every time. A shot
                        from Cory nearly scored. The ball baing again in play, Bombardier Sales made
                        a fine run, thus transferring the play to the Institute goal, where Appleby
                        threw out the ball, which was taken up by Simmons, whi raced up the field
                        and after a smart piece of passing, Smith forced a corner. The Artileery
                        backs (Bombardier Pike and Wheeler Williams) again put in some fine work on
                        front of goal. Gunner Price, getting possession of the ball, passed to
                        Driver Cheeseman, who ran up the field and transferred to Gunner Barker, who
                        shot at goal – but Appleby was not asleep. He kicked out and Hayes ran out
                        the ball, passes it to Cory, who shot at goal, the ball striking one of the
                        defenders. Hands was given against Donaldson and soon after a foul against
                        Attswood, play being in the open when the whistle blew.</p>
                    <p>Final score: Institute 1 goal, Artillery 0.</p>

                    <p>At the annual meeting of the Kobe Golf Club lately, the annual challenge cup
                        which is played for from scratch, was won by Mr. H.E. daunt with 80,
                        comprised of 48 in the first round and 37 in the second round. This 9says
                        the Kobe Chronicle) is the "Rokkosan record" in competitions for the round
                        of 9 holes. The conditions of this competion are that all players starting
                        for one event must compete for the others. Mr. Daunt is well-known in Cairo,
                        where he spent last winter.</p>
