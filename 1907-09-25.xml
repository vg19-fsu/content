                    <head>THE DISAPPEARING TURK.</head>
                    <p>The fact that the delegates to The Hague Conference should have presumed to
                        classify Turkey among the second-class Powers has very naturally caused
                        annoyance at Constantinople. For years the Sultan has been courted by the
                        various European Governments. By skilful diplomacy he has managed to sow the
                        seeds of jealousy among his various suitors, and by so doing has maintained
                        his European position. It is by such means that he has succeeded hitherto in
                        his refusal to execute the many schemes of better government presented by
                        the Fowers, and had these mutual jealousies not been in a measure effaced,
                        the partial success of the present Macedonian Reforms would never have been
                        achieved. As it is, Europe for once presents a united front, the tactics of
                        the Porte have failed, and the Sultan is compelled, much against his will,
                        to bow to the inevitable. It may be that henceforth the eyes of the blind
                        Turk will be opened to the absolute necessity of improved administration it
                        his stay in Europe is to be prolonged. The difficulty is that modern methods
                        of government are totally at variance with Turkish ideas. The sword is his
                        Court of Appeal, and it is the only form of justice the Turk understands.
                        Unfortunately, there is a very large Christian element in the country to
                        which such methods of rule are distasteful, to say the least, but for whose
                        presence Europe might have left the Sultan free to direct the ship of State
                        as he deemed best. But reforms or no reforms, the Turk must sooner or later
                        qnit Europe. With all his sterling qualities, which include loyalty,
                        religious fervour, obedience, hospitality, military discipline, and extreme
                        patience under every trial, he is, and always will be, regarded as an alien.
                        How long his removal will be delayed depends very much on the mutual
                        agreement of the Powers as to his successor. </p>

                    <p>Some time before the fete the Vali caused<lb/> special invitations to be
                        distributed, announc-<lb/> ing the programme of the reception. Early at<lb/>
                        8am. on the first of Septembef he. repaired<lb/> to the Seraglio to receive

                        and neighbourhood, followed all in official<lb/> tenue wearing full
                        degorations. In the open<lb/> space at the approach of the Seraglio, lines
                        of<lb/> regulars, gendarmes, and police, as well as of<lb/> the students of
                        the Government schools, civil<lb/> and military, were drawn up for salatein
                        honour<lb/> of the occasion. Once assembled in the reception<lb/> hall of
                        the Seraglio the chief of the Ulema,<lb/> Abdel Kader Effendi El Nahas, made
                        an open-<lb/> ing address embodying supplicatory prayer<lb/> "for the

                        which a deep response of "Amen" was<lb/> solemnly uttered by the assembly
                        and the<lb/> military band strack the first notes of the<lb/> Hamidieh

                        down<lb/> in the open space of "Padishahim Tchuk Ya<lb/> Sha." Then the Vali
                        received the personal<lb/> contratalations of the distinguished
                        assembly<lb/> in the hall, and some of the studentsof the<lb/> Government
                        schools delivered eulogistic poems<lb/> extolling the qualities of His

                    <p>At 10 a.m. the different Consuls and foreign<lb/> notables arrived to tender
                        their congratulations,<lb/> after which his Excellency, accompanied by
                        the<lb/> higher officials of the Vilayet, proceeded<lb/> to the barracks to
                        return the congratulations<lb/> of the Commandant of the garrison in
                        aecord-<lb/> ance with the protocol prescribing the exchange<lb/> of sach
                        official courtesies between the civil and<lb/> military authorities. After
                        the commandant<lb/> had received the congratulations of official and<lb/>
                        non-official personages he proceeded with the<lb/> Vali and Rear Admiral

                        and their dragomans, the ulemas, the clerical<lb/> dignitaries, and a host
                        of notabes, foreign and<lb/> native, to the Hamidieh School of Industry<lb/>
                        and Commerce, which, together with the Ha.<lb/> midieh Hospital, were to be
                        inaugurated<lb/> officially in accordance with imperial order.<lb/> Arriving
                        at the entrance of the School, and<lb/> prior to the opening of the
                        ceremony, the elite<lb/> of the crowd were kindly requested to draw<lb/>
                        themselves out into a crescenttshape to be<lb/> photographed.</p>
                    <p>The ceremony was conducted in the following<lb/> manner. Arriving at the door
                        Abd el Kader<lb/> Effendi En Nahas, delivered the traditional <lb/>
                        supplicatory prayer for His Majesty after<lb/> three trumpet salutes. Then
                        the military band<lb/> struck the Hamidieh anthem accompanied by<lb/> huzzas
                        from the countless crowd. He then<lb/> approached the door and cut asunder
                        the<lb/> ribbons drawn across it, when the two folds<lb/> were flung wide
                        open, and Khalil Pasha passed<lb/> through to the reception hall, followed
                        by the <lb/> distinguishhed invites, and the common<lb/> multitude.</p>
                    <p>In the reception hall the seats were taken<lb/> in the order of priority. On
                        an elevated dais the<lb/> Vali took seat with the ulemas and the
                        clerical<lb/> dignitaries of the different Christian sects to<lb/> his left,
                        and the Consular to his right.<lb/> In front were the civil and military
                        officials and<lb/> notables of the town, and behind the vociferous<lb/>
                        crowd. Abdel Kader Effendi El Dana, Presi-<lb/> dent of the Municipality,
                        and Hassan Bey<lb/> Beyhum, another Moslem notability, and both<lb/> well
                        known orators, delivered patriotic spee<lb/> ches followed by other orators
                        of lesser fire.<lb/> Then refreshments were served, and the differ-<lb/> ent
                        parts of the establishment inspected. Ano<lb/> ther ceremony of inauguration
                        was conducted<lb/> at the Hamidieh hospital with the same at-<lb/> tendance,
                        and it was past noon before the final<lb/> act was gone through, and the
                        invites were<lb/> free to go back to their homes and rest after a<lb/> long
                        drawn ceremony.</p>
                    <p>In the evening Khalil Pasha held another<lb/> reception in the garden of the

                        school and the of cool breezes of the <lb/> night, further refreshed by the
                        jets of water, <lb/> made the entertainment a very pleasant one. <lb/>
                        Refreshments. As usual at night-time all the offices<lb/> of the important
                        administrations such as the <lb/> Imperial Ottoman Bank, the Gas Company,
                        the <lb/> Railway Company etc. as well as the houses of <lb/> the notables
                        especially amongst Moslems were<lb/> illuminates with more or less taste and
                        liber-<lb/> ality. Of course the Seraglio, Barracks and<lb/> Dragons
                        building were brilliantly illuminated<lb/> but the palatial edifice of
                        Messrs Sabbagh <lb/> where the Gas Company's offices are, outshone<lb/> all
                        others. </p>

                    <head>THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN.</head>
                    <p>A corerspondent writes:- "In a recent issue<lb/> you reported that the last
                        meeting of the <lb/> Municipal Delegation considered a project,<lb/>
                        submitted by several notables of Alexandria<lb/> for the formation of a
                        society for the protection <lb/> of infants and young children. Dr.
                        Schiess<lb/> Pasha warmly welcomed the proposal and most<lb/> aptly remarked
                        "that the feelings of pity and <lb/> humanity which have inspired the
                        authors of <lb/> this project are sufficient to demand for it a <lb/> kindly
                        welcome from the Delegation." That <lb/> Sir, is all very well and admirable
                        in spirit, but<lb/> is it logical in conception. It must not be<lb/>
                        forgotten that at one of the meetings held at the<lb/> Municipality to
                        consider the best manner<lb/> which Lord Cromer's work in Egypt might
                        be<lb/> commemorated an identical proposition, propos-<lb/> ed by the Cairo
                        Committee, and attaching<lb/> especial importance to the protection of
                        na<lb/> tive children, was considered. But in spite<lb/> of the wish
                        expressed by Lord Cromer<lb/> himself before leaving the country, this<lb/>
                        project was received most coldly by the <lb/> meeting, and later replaced by
                        a scheme<lb/> for an anti-tuberculosis home, Certain Euro-<lb/> pean
                        notables of Alexandria, however, desired <lb/> to manifest their sympathy
                        with the work of <lb/> protecting children and subscribed with that <lb/>
                        object to Lady Cromer's dispensaries. Our<lb/> town is also supplied with a
                        modest institution<lb/> which is doing excellent work in its own small<lb/>
                        way at Bab Sidra, near the Gama Sultan.<lb/> Would it not then be more
                        rational before<lb/> creating new societies to interest oneself in<lb/>
                        those already formed, and develope them so<lb/> as to make them more
                        efficacious? It will be<lb/> remembered that the Lady Cromer dispensary<lb/>
                        was founded in memory of the late Lady Ethel<lb/> Stanley, who left in this
                        country such sincere<lb/> memories, thanks to a public subscription of<lb/>
                        £4,000, of which £2,600 was used to build an<lb/> institution. The
                        international committee which <lb/> took the initiative of this
                        commemorative work<lb/> was presided over by Prince Hussein Pasha <lb/>

                    <head>THE RENT CRISIS</head>
                    <head type="sub">LANDLORD AND TENANT</head>
                    <p>In a recent issue we reported that out of<lb/> sixty cases brought before the
                        Mixed Tribunals<lb/> by landlords against tenants, who protested<lb/>
                        against the anjustifiably increased rents which<lb/> 80 seriously handicap
                        the man of moder-<lb/> ate means, judgment had been given in<lb/> every
                        instance in favour of the landlord, and<lb/> we once more take the
                        opportunity of pointing<lb/> out to the Government the necessity of
                        amend-<lb/> ing the existing laws by which the two<lb/> parties are bound.
                        We recognise that no<lb/> fault can be found with the decision of the<lb/>
                        judges, who could but pass judgment in accord-<lb/> ance with the letter of
                        the law. The fault lies<lb/> with the Civil Mixed Code, which was drawn<lb/>
                        up to favour the landlords in consequence of the<lb/> weakness of their
                        position prior to itsexistence<lb/> in its present form. To account for sudh
                        a code,<lb/> favouring jm every respect, as we have said,<lb/> the
                        landlords, it is necessary to hark back<lb/> to the time previous to the
                        institution of the<lb/> Mixed Tribonals. Atthattime the landlords were<lb/>
                        unable to enforce payment of rent by any<lb/> Coart of Justice on account of
                        the Babylonic<lb/> judiciary scate. Matters reached such a point<lb/> that
                        the landlord, who desired a tenant to<lb/> leave on account of non-payment
                        of rent, had<lb/> te find him another house and even pay him<lb/> an
                        indemnity to cover the expenses of removal<lb/> Nabar Pasha, who recognised
                        the unjust state<lb/> ot affairs, set himself to provide a remedy and<lb/>
                        came to the rescue of the landlords, almost all<lb/> of whom at that period
                        were natives, and<lb/> amixed coda, that which exists to-day, was<lb/> drawn
                        ap, by which the landlords obtained<lb/> practically full power over their
                        tenanta, who,<lb/> to-day are in their tarn unable to safeguard<lb/> their
                        own interests. The time, therefore, has<lb/> come when it is necessary to
                        revise the law<lb/> of 187580 that the landlord shall not have<lb/> the
                        supreme power over his tenant which<lb/> he now possesses.</p>

                    <head>FIRES IN ALEXANDRIA</head>
                    <p>A fire broke out in the kitchen section of<lb/> Ras el Tin palace at twenty
                        minutes to six<lb/> yesterday afternoon, a wooden beam built into<lb/> one
                        of the flaes being the cause thereof The<lb/> firemen stationed at the
                        Palace, assisted by<lb/> water carriers, had little difheulty in
                        extinguish-<lb/> ing the fire before any extensive damage could<lb/> be
                        done, and when the steamer from Menshieh<lb/> arrived on the scene all
                        danger of a conflagra-<lb/> tion was over.</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>Previous to this, however, the fire-brigade<lb/> had already extinguished a
                        fire in Nasr el Din<lb/> street, near Rasel-Tin. The call was given at<lb/>
                        12.45 p.m. and the brigade was on the scene<lb/> within six minttes. Here
                        they found the<lb/> usual difficulty in getting a good water sapply,<lb/>
                        the nearest hydrant being 520 metres distant<lb/> from the fire. The shop,
                        which contained a<lb/> large stock of petroleum, was well alight<lb/> the
                        fire had already penetrated into<lb/> the flat above, the flames spreading
                        up the<lb/> front of the shop entered the second floor<lb/> by, the windows.
                        The steamer arrived,<lb/> however, in time to confine the fire<lb/> the
                        rooms Already ablaze,and it was but the<lb/> work of about an hour and a
                        half to completely<lb/> extinguish the fire. The damage is reported<lb/> to
                        be about £450, but this will doubtless be<lb/> found to be a considerably
                        exaggerated estimate.<lb/> At 3-30 this morning a carpenter's shop off<lb/>
                        the Coptie Charch street caught fire, and when<lb/> the brigade arrived they
                        tound the saw pit and<lb/> machinery well afire, bat the people had
                        beat<lb/> own the flames considerably, and it was but<lb/> the work of ten
                        minutes to completely extin-<lb/> guish the fire</p>

                    <head>TURKISH VILLAGE DESTROYED</head>
                    <p>Dr. F von Katser, the Chief of the Bosnian <lb/> Geological Department, has
                        forwarded details <lb/> of a catastrophe by which the Turkish Village <lb/>
                        of Mustajbasic has been entirely destroyed.<lb/> The village was built on a
                        mountain slope,<lb/> and was divided into two parts by the river<lb/> This
                        time not containing, as usual in the<lb/> Krivaja. The inhabitants were
                        recently alarm<lb/> ed by rumbling noises in the hight, and,<lb/> rushing
                        from their houses in the belief that an<lb/> earthquake was in progress,
                        found that part of<lb/> the mountain was moving slowly down upon<lb/> them.
                        A general flight into the open country<lb/> followed, and when daylight came
                        it was found<lb/> that the fields and gardens were already cover<lb/> ed
                        with loose stones and earth While the land<lb/> slide was continuing. At
                        considerable risk the <lb/> peasants says the "Globe"saved most of
                        their<lb/> movable belongings, and their animals, and<lb/> then retired out
                        of danger to watch their houses<lb/> being slowly crushed in. Twenty-six
                        farms were<lb/> thus destroyed. The earth movement ceased<lb/> suddenly at
                        midday on the second day, but by<lb/> that time the upper part of the
                        village had<lb/> been covered with earth to a depth of over<lb/> forty
                        feet.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the land on which the lower part<lb/> of the village stood began to
                        move down the<lb/> mountain slope, the slip commencing without<lb/> the
                        slightest warning, and continuing for a dis-<lb/> tance of over half a
                        kilometre. No loss of life<lb/> was caused, but the damage done was
                        very<lb/> extensive, and the disaster was completed by<lb/> the original
                        landslide obstructing the flow of<lb/> the river, which flooded the entire
                        neighbour.<lb/> hood. The peasants eventnally cut through<lb/> the natural
                        dam thus formed, and released the<lb/> water.</p>
                    <p>The catastrophe is attributed to the sudden<lb/> melting of the snow
                        accumulations on the<lb/> mountain commit daring a spell of abnormal<lb/>
                        heat.</p>

                    <head type="sub"> AN IMPORTANT PUBLICATION </head>
                    <p>Certainly the most valuable publication in<lb/> the domain of Egyptology this
                        year is the<lb/> second volume of the "Tebtanis Papyri" just<lb/> issued as
                        the second instalment of the Univer-<lb/> sity of California Publications in
                        Graeco-Roman<lb/> Archwology 1907 under the editorshipof Messrs<lb/>
                        Grenfell and Haunt, and Goodspeed, with the<lb/> assistance of Mr. Smyly, of
                        Dublin. The first<lb/> volume of papyri from this site was made up of<lb/>
                        ee Greek documents obtained by care<lb/> fully disintregrating the cartopage
                        of crocodile<lb/> mum nies, and a large number of similary deriv-<lb/> ed
                        manuscripts still remain to be published.</p>
                    <p>The present volume is devoted to papyri<lb/> found in the rains of houses,
                        and as these edi-<lb/> fices, which were the final series of
                        habitations<lb/> erected in the Payoum, are generally of the<lb/> Roman era,
                        but few Greek, or Ptolemaic do-<lb/> caments are included. Indeed in some
                        instances<lb/> the writings are to be dated late in the 3rd.<lb/> century
                        A.D. Some idea of the importance of<lb/> the book may be formed when it is
                        explained<lb/> that over 170 texts of more or less length are<lb/> rendered
                        in full and summaries of more than<lb/> 250 others are appended.</p>
                    <p>The short account of the more universally<lb/> interesting contents we can
                        alone furnish here<lb/> will present some idea of the pregnant promise<lb/>
                        of the modern science of "Papyrology."<lb/> The students and scholars
                        amongst our<lb/> readers will naturally desire to know what<lb/> fragments
                        of very celebrated classic authors<lb/> are restored to usin this volome.
                        Whilst the<lb/> ordinary folk will more look for what it reveals<lb/> to us
                        of the life and fortunes of Egypt's inhabi-<lb/> tants for the six centaries
                        upon which its<lb/> contents may be said to throw the whole light<lb/> of
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The chief find in respect of classical litera-<lb/> ture is that of &amp;
                        portion, in Greek, ot the<lb/> history of the Trojan War, by Dictys
                        Cretensia,<lb/> an author whose work has hitherto only been<lb/> extant in
                        late latin versions, and who some<lb/> persons denied not only that his book
                        was<lb/> never written in Greek but that such a person-<lb/> age never
                        existed. The text preserved consists<lb/> of two long colamna, of which an
                        excellent fac.<lb/> simile is given, written upon the beck ofa<lb/> series
                        of Roman Revenue retarns dated AD.<lb/> 206, and therefore the Dictys
                        Cretensis copy<lb/> is of the third century. The recovery of this<lb/>
                        meries Belli Troiani," which was a sort of prose<lb/> guide to Homer, is of
                        peculiar interest because<lb/> of the unusual statements as to the origin
                        of<lb/> the book. In the prologue to the Latin version<lb/> we are told that
                        it was written by Dictys, the<lb/> friend argl companion of Idomeneus, in
                        Pho<lb/> enician letters, upon sheets of bark which were,<lb/> at his death,
                        deposited in his grave at Cnossos<lb/> There, in the time of Nero, anearthg
                        vuake opened<lb/> the tomb and the writings being discovered<lb/> were
                        transliterated by order of the Emperor<lb/> into Greek. Of this Greek
                        version a Latin<lb/> rendering was made by a certain L. Septimiua,<lb/> who,
                        however, in a note gives a somewhat dif.<lb/> ferent story of the discovery
                        of the work. The<lb/> fortunate find of the Tebtanis Greek text does<lb/>
                        not, of course, substantiate the statement as<lb/> to the Phoenician
                        alphabet having been used<lb/> for the original composition ; but it does
                        carry<lb/> back the work to its Greek prototype, and,<lb/> moreover, very
                        considerably dates back the<lb/> period when it was written: It must
                        have<lb/> been comparitively familiar to readers at<lb/> the commencement of
                        the third century<lb/> for a Fayoum library to possess a copy, and<lb/>
                        therefore even if we believe the story of its<lb/> discovery to be a fable
                        it must have been<lb/> written when the author could have had access<lb/>
                        toall the most valuable accounts of the Trojan<lb/> era, which finally
                        perished with the destruction<lb/> of the library at Alexandria, were still
                        to<lb/> be drawn from. The sources of Dietys were<lb/> therefore of great
                        antiquity and not as has<lb/> been suggested merely those of the later<lb/>
                        mythographers and rhapsodists. The age of<lb/> the new Greek version must,
                        if it is of sufficient<lb/> that Herr F. Noack several years ago
                        contend<lb/> edthat Dictys certainly had been translated<lb/> from the Greek
                        to the Latin should be stated<lb/> in honor to his scholarly judgment. The
                        other<lb/> Classical fragments are two fairly long pieces of<lb/> Homer.</p>
                    <p>This Time not containing as usual in the<lb/> papyri, a number of additional
                        lines to those<lb/> be found in our well known. classical<lb/> manuscripte.
                        There are also about 50 lines of<lb/> the oration of Demosthenes "De False
                        Lega-<lb/> tion" dating from early in the second century,<lb/> and very
                        useful as proving the substantial<lb/> acouracy of our versions of the
                        speaker.Coming<lb/> now to the nameroas documents concerning<lb/> the
                        administration efthe country, legal matters,<lb/> deeds and leases,
                        contracts and mortgages and<lb/> also the social and religious life. The
                        most<lb/> entertaining from a popular point of view, and<lb/> also very
                        valaable historically, are a nomber of<lb/> papyni relating to the
                        priesthood of Soknebtania,<lb/> the crocodile deity temple town from
                        which<lb/> this literary treasure trove has come. About two<lb/> years ago

                        Egypt"<lb/> (in German). How gratified he will be with<lb/> the immense
                        store of information these papyri<lb/> afford may be imagined. He will also
                        for the<lb/> second volume have the assistance of M. R.<lb/> Lagneur's

                            the gorse bushes on Easteote, and if this<lb/> latter course was

                    <head>THE ENGLISH CHURCH<lb/> AT KHARTOUM.</head>
                    <p>Rapid progress is being made with the con-<lb/> struction of the foundations
                        of the English,<lb/> Chareh at Khartoum. The site chosen is<lb/>
                        convenient--a parallelogram of which the long<lb/> sides face north and
                        south, the latter fronting<lb/> on Khediye-avenue, while the road
                        bounding<lb/> the former divides it from the gardens of the<lb/> Palace. Ata
                        sifort distance from the west is<lb/> the open space in whieh has been
                        erected the<lb/> Gordon Statue, and therefrom runs one of the<lb/> main
                        roads of the town towards the site of the<lb/> new railway station. For
                        climatic reasdne the actaal building of the ehureh is being raised to<lb/> a
                        height of 2ft. above the road level, the spare<lb/> ground bemg laid out as
                        gardens, a pleasant<lb/> feature made possible by the inelosion of the<lb/>
                        area within the bounds of the water supply ot<lb/> the Palace. The whole is
                        to be enclosed with a<lb/> low wall and iron railings.</p>
                    <p>The-plan takes the forni of a Latin cross,<lb/> having on the south a
                        detached campanile,<lb/> connected with the nave by a covered way, its<lb/>
                        lewer part serving for a Baptistery. .<lb/> speaking, the greatest length,
                        over all, will be<lb/> 54 metres, the width of the chancel, nave, anc<lb/>
                        transepts 13 mtres, and at the crossing about<lb/> 19 metres. It has been
                        designed to provide <lb/> accommodation for about 600 persons. On each<lb/>
                        side of the nave and transepts are narrow<lb/> passage aisles, and an
                        ambulatory encompasses<lb/> the chancel. The transepts will be arranged<lb/>
                        for use as chapels, that on the south for daily<lb/> services, while the
                        north transept is to be called<lb/> the "Gordon Memorial Chapel," and will
                        con<lb/> tain panels in memory of those who have<lb/> fallen in the
                        execation of their duty in the<lb/> Sadan. Many of these have already been
                        pro<lb/> mised. The main entrance is at the west end, but<lb/> this will be
                        used, as @ rule, only for ceremonial<lb/> or special oceasions, side doors
                        being provided<lb/> beth on the north and south within the shelter<lb/> of
                        the transepts, so that the prevailing winds<lb/> being from one or other of
                        those quarters an<lb/> alternative means of access will always be
                        avail-<lb/> able. The choir is raised three steps from the<lb/> nave, and is
                        furnished with a screen to be<lb/> male of wood from the Babrel Ghazal,
                        with<lb/> which also or with some othet suitable native<lb/> wood the stalls
                        are to be made.</p>
                    <p>The design of the church itself is in many<lb/> ways remarkable. One great
                        principle had been<lb/> kept always in view by Mr. Weir Schultz--the<lb/>
                        architect--that of absolute simplicity and<lb/> utility. He has broken away
                        from all the stereo-<lb/> typed "styles" There are pointed arches,<lb/>
                        because this construction reaches the groand<lb/> quicker and does not need
                        heavy buttresses to<lb/> resist the trust. The roof has a low pith,<lb/>
                        because thatis more suitable to the "special<lb/> loeal conditions, and the
                        smaller windows and<lb/> openings of the ambulatory are not arched,<lb/> but
                        built with simple sloping Slabs, because<lb/> this is more easily and
                        cheaply done bythe<lb/> local labour available thaw the arched oem.<lb/> The
                        material generally will bea aendstone of<lb/> two saaiel yellow and a pale
                        red, which is<lb/> got from a hill called Gebel Arli, on the White<lb/>
                        Nile, and about 28 miles soath of Khartoum.<lb/> The floor will be laid with
                        Sudanese marble<lb/> and the roof covered with green glazed cor<lb/> rugated
                        tiles ; indeed, the church will be built<lb/> with local labour and local
                        material as far as<lb/> possible, and the choice of its details is
                        raled<lb/> by this important consideration. The windows<lb/> will be shaded
                        from the direet rays of the san,<lb/> and in hot weather can be-ecreened
                        with mats<lb/> to be kept cool with the trickle of water from a<lb/>
                        perforated pipe. Within a fine and diymified<lb/> effect is produced by the
                        great constructional<lb/> ibs which uphold the roof; all the more
                        strik-<lb/> ing because they are not fretted with recru-<lb/> descences of
                        obsolete or alien ornament, but<lb/> tell their own tale in the simplest of
                        architec<lb/> ural language. The works are under the su-<lb/> pervision of
                        Mr. John Latimer, who is aided<lb/> by the advice of Captain Done, R.E.,
                        Director<lb/> of Military Works for the Sudan and a member<lb/> of the
                        Church Building Committee.</p>
                    <p>To complete this great undertaking some-<lb/> like £7,000 is still needed,
                        not counting the<lb/> cost of the campanile and a most necessary<lb/>
                        increase ot the endowment fund. There is money<lb/> enough in hand to carry
                        on the building for<lb/> about another year, and to avoid the waste and<lb/>
                        loss of an interruption in the work it is boped<lb/> that this interval of
                        time may suffice for the<lb/> remainder. A general appeal for help is
                        shortly<lb/> to be made. Meanwhile, sobseriptions will be<lb/> received and
                        acknowledged by Major Phipps,<lb/> the hon. seoretary of the Khartoum
                        Church<lb/> Fund, The Grove, Khartoum. </p>

                        programme des mieux réussis. Lampo, seul rival de Frégoli émerveille sen

                        homme que l'on voit ou s'il a une doublure; des paris ont même été engagés,
