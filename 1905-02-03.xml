                    <head>THE RUSSIAN "MAGNA CHARTA."</head>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon's startling news from St. Petersburg is contradicted in
                        to-day's telegrams. Such a capitulation of the Tsar would have been an
                        admission to his subjects and the world at large that Russian bureaucracy is
                        the failure it has long proved to be in the eyes of the civilised world. In
                        the universal judg ment of the civilised world it stands convicted of lese
                        humanité; it is an outworn, belated anachronism, which lags, superfluous and
                        noxious, on the stage of human affairs. It has tried to borrow from the
                        civilised world the material fruits of modern progress, while denying to the
                        people the intellectual, moral,<cb n="6"/> and political fruits of that
                        progress. In other words, it has, attempted the impossible and has failed,
                        as it was bound to fail. That is why it has got to go, though whether it
                        will succumb at dice under the reforms of M. Witte, should he after all come
                        into power, may be a matter of doubt, and the freedom of the press, à
                        representative council (to be created in a fortnight !), the co-operation"
                        of the people with the Government, and all the other paraphernalia of what
                        the telegrams described as a "Magna Charta," my after all, should they
                        eventually be given to the nation, turn out after the lapse of a few months
                        to be as nugatory as any scheme of reform previously mooted.-</p>
                    <p>Before the war began politicians in all countries used to speculate on the
                        effect which defeat might have on the Russian mind. On the whole, perhaps;
                        the impression which seemed to have most to say for itself was that reverses
                        would evoke the passion of loyalty, and that the things which make for
                        division would be postponed until after a final victory. Possibly if the
                        reverses which Russia has sustained had been due solely to the fortune of
                        war, this expectation might have been fulfilled. As it is, however, those
                        reversés are, largely due to faults which might have been guarded
                        against,-faults which, if the Russian system had been what it professes to
                        be, would have been. guarded against. In theory, it has conspicuous.
                        advantages in carrying on war. It has unity of purpose, promptness of
                        execution, and above all, untiring vigilance in preparation. In practice, it
                        has proved to have none of these things. There have been irreconcilable
                        differences of opinion in the Government, extensive corruption in both
                        services; want of initiative and of training in the officers. The system
                        which should show its best side in time of war has broken down at every
                        point. It has failed to give that security against attack from with out for
                        which a nation will sacrifice so much. The machine has proved incapable of
                        doing its proper work; consequently it behoves Russia to discover some
                        alternative machine to take its place.</p>
                    <p>It was obvious that the news was greatly exaggerated, and the appointment of
                        a reactionary as Minister of the Interior, announced in this morning's
                        telegrams is significant. Was it to be expected that the Tsar would suddenly
                        divest himselt of an authority which he himself probably, and a great number
                        of his subjects certainly, regard as specially divine? The most daring
                        theorist, if he were seated on the Russian throne, might hesitate to bring
                        down about his ears the vast fabric of Russian administration, and there is
                        no reason to suppose that, in this sense, the Tsar is a theorist at all. He
                        is more likely to refuse to make the changes, deinanded of him, and take the
                        chance of being able to suppress the insur rectionary movement. There could
                        be no likelihood of the provisions of this so-called. "Magna Charta" being
                        permanent Constitu tions grow and are not made, and any hasty scheme of
                        government reform is as hopeless in Russia as it would be in Turkey, for.
                        corrup tion is everywhere visible in Russia. But even constitutional
                        Governments are not free from corrupt habits, so the corruption made visible
                        in Russia may continue with any new, Government which may be created. Yet
                        there has been little done to prevent corruption in. any department; and
                        this is one great cause of discontent.</p>
                    <p>The great mass of the people are unfitted for constitutional government, but
                        the intelligence of Russia is unfitted for autocratic control. The struggle
                        of to-day is one for control between the spirit of autocracy and the spirit
                        of intelligence. Should the latter succeed, then the people will be fed and
                        ruled with some degree of intelligence; should autocracy prevail, then a
                        greater veil of darkness must be drawn around Russia, and it will continue
                        to be what it is, "a land of tyrants and a den of slaves."</p>

                            <p>The "Daily Telegraph" learns from St. Petersburg that as a result of
                                an interview on Monday with the Minister Yermoloff, and on his
                                earliest representations, the Tsar signed a case demonstrated a
                                Russian Magna Chart. This directs M. Witte, as President of the
                                Committee of Ministers, to further extend the reform laid down in
                                the Ukase of the 27th December last. It orders that the people shall
                                be invited to co-operate with the Government, leaving M. Witte to
                                determine the manner of such co-operation. It commands the
                                restoration of order throughout the Empire by peaceful methods, and
                                the' pensioning of those who were made orphans or cripples on the
                                22nd ult. The Council of Ministers afterwards die caused the new
                                situation, M. Witte throwing the whole weight of his influence on
                                the popular side. It was decided to release the captives' to-day,
                                and to free the Press. General Trepoff is to be sent to Manchuria
                                later. A representative council is to be created in a fortnight.

                            <p>(Official). The report of the "Magna Charta" is incorrect. It was
                                based on the following circumstances: The Council of Ministers
                                rejected a motion submitted by M. Witte to record its opinion
                                regarding the incidents on the 22nd of January, and to adopt
                                measures in order to prevent their recurrence. M. Witte, whose
                                motion was on the minutes, there upon submitted a memorandum to the
                                Tsar, who approved it. The Council held an extraordinary sitting on
                                the 31st January, in order to discuss the memorandum, when the
                                question of an enquiry into tire incidents of the 22nd January was
                                considered. The Minister of Finance was empowered to prepare a
                                scheme for social and legislative reform with special re to the

                    <head>THE ALEXANDRIA SCANDAL THIS MORNING'S HEARING.</head>
                    <p>The Italian Consular Court at Alexandria was crowded this morning on the
                        occasion of the demand of M. Attilio Ninci, commercial director of the
                        Societe des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie at Alexandria, for a separation
                        from his wife Olga, nee Constaufiaides, on the grounds of her adultery with
                        Judge Constantine Dimaras. President of the Hellenic Consular Court at
                        Alexandria. M. Ninci was represented by Maitre Colucci and his wife by
                        Maitre Colucci. M. Ninci sat by the side of his counsel but the lady did not
                        put in an appearance. He went on and endeavoured to show that, if the Court
                        should grant a separation, it should be pronounced on the grounds of the
                        misconduct of both husband and wife. Counsel then argued that no such
                        separation should be accorded, as M. Ninci had condoned the offence by
                        agreeing to be reconciled with his wife after he had ascertained that she
                        had committed adultery. Counsel cited an article of the Code applicable to
                        such a case. He insisted that in any case should be granted, and then
                        proceeded to read further correspondence from M. Ninci to his wife from
                        which he deduced the conclusions : That the husband was a man of utterly
                        depraved tastes, that he had maltreated his wife, that he had neglected her
                        when ill and in every way had by his callous conduct to the sin of his wife,
                        who had only succumbed to the Judge alter having been grossly neglected
                        during her illness by her husband. After the reconciliation at Helouan
                        marital intercourse had been resumed, M. Ninci returned here, but as soon os
                        be knew that the Judge had come back to Alexandria, on accident occurred in
                        consequence of which M.Niuci returned to Helonan aggressively maltreated his
                        wife. Reconciliation was now impossible and counsel concluded that both
                        husband and wife were equally to blame and said that it was the wife who
                        made a complaint to the Consulate and asked for better treatment or judicial
                        separation. It was only that M. Ninci brought the present case. Maltre
                        Colucci rose to reply at 12.30 p.m., but the further hearing of the case was
                        postponed until 4 o'clock this afternoon.</p>

                    <head>THE PILGRIMAGE.</head>
                    <p>The outward Egyptian pilgrimage this year ended practically yesterday with
                        the departure of the Khedival Mail Line's S.S. "Fayoum" from Suez. The
                        Khedival Mail Line has this year instituted the plan of shipping the
                        Egyptians separately from the foreign pilgrims. This system has received the
                        approval of the Government. A correspondent writes on the subject of the
                        Mahmal theft:—Thirty thousand pounds is rather a Urge sum to send to Mecca
                        and Medina. Does it all go with the Mahmal? If so the thieves at Abbassich
                        were merciful the amount is so considerable that I should think it might be
                        made the basis of a bargain whereby in consideration of its continued
                        payment annually the Bedouins should cease from massacring and pillaging
                        unoffending pilgrims. Surely some such terms might be arranged with a view
                        to putting on end to present and prospective perils. Under existing
                        circumstances we are putting a premium on crime and outrage.</p>

                        Mr. Hall's work at Deir-el-Babari has so far been successful enough for them
                        to announce that they have uncovered the perform of the pyramid of that
                        Mentu-hotep whose temple they discovered last year, and whose hawk name was
                        Neb-kheru-Ra. They have also found monuments of two other kings of the

                    <head>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>LA TRAVIATA.</p>
                    <p>The stage of the Abbas Helmy Theatre was last night the scene of a triumph
                        the like of which it has rarely, if ever, witnessed before. The great
                        artiste, whose visit Alexandria has been look- ing forward to for some time
                        past, was the object of a tremendous shower of applause from the moment she
                        entered on the scene, and during the whole time that Signora Bellin- cioni
                        occupied the boards she kept her audience, as it were, under a spell. La
                        Traviata, which was the piece selected for her first appearance here, is not
                        by any means one of the best of Verdi's operas. It was, however, by such
                        paths as Traviata and Rigoletto that the composer came finally into his
                        great kingdom. The opers is essentially a one-part piece, and as such gives
                        an infinite amount of scope for effective singing and acting to the
                        interpreter of the leading role. To judge by the support given yesterday
                        evening to Signora Bellincioni by the rest of the company, it is just as
                        well that this is so. La Traviata was Signora Bellin- cioni and Signora
                        Bellincioni was La Traviata. The other performers were distinctly in the
                        background, which is much to be regretted. The weakness of the tenor, Sig.
                        E. Chiericati, which was especially apparent in the first act, without an
                        artiste like Bellincioni to play Violetta Valery, would have inevitably
                        damned the production, while the baritone, Sig. Badini, did not rise to the
                        occasion, and gave a com- paratively poor interpretation of the role of
                        Giorgio Germon. These defects, however, were fully compensated for by the
                        prima-donna. Signora Bellincioni was nothing less than superb; if it is
                        possible to imagine the singing of a most exquisite bird on the wing in the
                        twilight of a summer's day, if, in a word, one on recognise the beauty of
                        movement com- bined with the beauty of voice, which belongs essentially to
                        the meaning and signifi- cance of the singer herself, then</p>

                    <p>begins to understand something of the beauty, the purity, the complete sense
                        of significance which attaches to such vocal accomplishment. Apart from her
                        glorious singing, her acting was one of the finest things to be seen
                        now-a-days on the lyric stage; the pathos of the part was brought out by her
                        to the utmost; the tragedy of the last act was interpreted in a manner that
                        only very great artists can interpret it. That the public recognised her
                        worth was plainly evident by the thunders of applause which greeted her at
                        each fall of the curtain, when the audience became almost frantic. Signora
                        Bellincioni, as befits a veritable artist, was exquisitely dressed. To
                        adequately describe her costumes would take. up more space than we have at
                        our disposal to-day. They should be seen to be admired. The chorus was not
                        all that we could have wished, but the orchestra did its work well.</p>

                    <head>NEW SUEZ CANAL</head>
                    <p>Mr. Theo. V. P. Angier writes in the London press that for the time being the
                        considera- tion of the subject of the Suez Canal is limited to the strong
                        case which the shipowners and merchants of our Empire and the rest of the
                        world, including France, have against the management of this monopolist
                        company. The charges against the company include: (1) the deliberate breach
                        and autocratic disregard of the solemn compact entered into, signed by the
                        late president M. de Lesseps, and confirm ed by the shareholders in general
                        meeting in 1883; (2) the unreasonable and oppressive demand for special
                        tonnage measurements of all ships for the sole purpose of Suez Canal
                        taxation, thereby putting every ship to the ex- pense of obtaining a Suez
                        Car.al certificate, while dock dues all over the world are taxed on the
                        ordinary tonnage on each ship's register; (3) the fast and loose
                        administration of its arbitrary rules for measuring ships' tonnage for the
                        basis of taxation; (4) the levying of dues heavy enough to produce 26 per
                        cent. profit on the immensely inflated capital, constituting a serious and
                        unjustifiable handicap on the world's trade, and falling most heavily on
                        British trade; (5) the concurrence of the seven British directors in these
                        proceedings without consulting the British shipowners and mer chants whose
                        interests they were admitted on the board to represent. The question, he
                        thinks, has also a broader commercial, political, and strategical aspect. It
                        is self-evident, he claims, that the capacity for traffic of the existing
                        canal is limited, and the progressive increase of the world's tonnage
                        requiring accommodation is unlimited. In these circumstances he sub- mits
                        that common prudence dictates the provision of a second canal, which should
                        be as soon as begun ossidble.</p>

                            the first two minutes of the game. After this, however, the R. Berks

                            adding another in the second half was of a very even character, and both

                            Mustapha. Saint Andrew's won the toss, and elected to kick up the field.
                            The opening stages of the game were confined to midfield, but the
                            superior combination of the regimental platers soon brought them into
                            the "Saint" Andrew's territory, and the defence had some anxious moments
                            in consequences. Play was again transferred to midfield, and
                            occasionally the visiting forwards would get away, but were always weak
                            at finishing. A series of corners looked dangerous for the Saints, but
                            they eventually cleared. A little later, however, Hutton got through the
                            defence, and put his team one up. The Saints tried hard to draw level,
                            but at half-time the score remained:Regiment 1- Saint Andrew's O.
                            Playing downhill in the second half, but with the sun against them, the
                            Saint hoped to reduce the lead, but everyone seemed to fall away in
                            disappointing fashion. The game throughout this half was really only a
                            case of shooting for goal on the part of the Berks, who were all over
                            their opponents, Jossy scored the second goal shortly after the restart
                            and a third came from the foot of Hill a few minutes later. Still the
                            Saints were unable to find their bearings, and it was not until late in
                            the second half that they managed to get within range of Adam. Cowie
                            tested him but he saved well, and it was no surprise when Haber and
                            Josey got well away, and the last named finished by scoring a fourth
                            goal for his side. Saint Andrew's could do nothing after this, and
                            retired defeated by four goals to nil.</p>

                    <head>INFANT MORTALITY IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir, Your leader entitled "What is
                        needed" is a brilliant and vigorous defence of the Government's non pass
                        policy, but I scarely think that it finally disposes of the questions
                        discussed. To me it is neither conclusive nor convincing. I cannot pretend
                        to view with the writer in dialectical skill, through it is easy to point
                        out several factors which his argument fails to notice. In the first place,
                        he leaves out of account the climatic conditions here, which are infinitely
                        more favorable to life than those existing in England, for instance, where
                        we have eight months of winter and the rest not infrequently of rain.
                        Statistics show that the death rate there amongst infants is largely due to
                        diseases occasioned by the inclemency of our climate. There is another point
                        which he leaves out of consideration, and that is overcrowding in our great
                        cities. The evil of overcrowding in Cairo and Alexandria cannot be compared
                        in extent to that of London and Liverpool. Furthermore, the English mother-I
                        speak of her because she is best known to me-is quite as careless, if not
                        more careless, of her infant than the Egyptian in the matter of feeding. It
                        is a common thing amongst the poorer classes in England for infants to be
                        reared upon fried fish washed down. Whatever the native mother's faults may
                        be, she does not give her infant to quiet its fractions moments. Yet,
                        despite inclement climate, overcrowding, and gin, the rats of infant
                        mortality is considerably lower in England than in Egypt. I therefore
                        maintain that something can be done and should be done to arrest the
                        excessive mortality amongst infants in this country. I am not very sanguine,
                        I confess, that my words will meet with any response from the authorities,
                        who seem far too engrossed in farming brilliant budgets to give heed to the
                        warnings. I am etc. Humanity</p>
