                    <head>LORD CROMER'S SPEECH.</head>
                    <p>For the first time in her history Egypt has heard, a great political speech.
                        No other term can be applied to the clear concise and weighty pronouncement
                        made by Lord Cromer in reply to the address of the President of the Council
                        of Ministers, and there are many recent political speeches that have been
                        termed great that suffer by comparison with Lord Cromer's words. True, we
                        had expected that the last speech delivered by the retiring British Agent
                        and Consul General would be worthy of his rep tation as a statesman and a
                        scholar, but we confess that we are as snrprised as we were delighted that
                        Lord Cromer, in spite of his illness which had caused not a little
                        apprehension among his more intimate friends, before the demonstration in
                        his honour should not only have vanquished all physical obstacles but have
                        achieved a notable oratorical triumph. His speech was not ornate but
                        itsevery sentence was pointed and polished as a rapier. There was none of
                        the frills and furbelows of the platform: whether reviewing the careers of
                        great Egyptians of the past or dealing with the problems of the future every
                        word told, and when Lord Cromer met the criticisms that have of late been
                        lavished on his policy, by a vigorous counter attack, the happy combination
                        of dignity, irony and wit, that has marked his previous speeches, did not
                        fail him. He carried the war with a vengeance into his opponents' camp: we
                        shall see what will be their defence against his vigorous assault. We have
                        no doubt that a few members of the audience did not share the views
                        expressed by the speaker and acclaimed By the <cb n="6"/> majority of those
                        present. But they cann ot fail to have been impressed by the greatness of
                        the occasion and the importance of its cause, the personality of the leading
                        actor in a historic scene and the enthusiasm with which some of the best
                        elements in Egyptian society welcomed the chief captain of the forces of
                        progress now retiring from the scene of his labars and triumphs. A statesman
                        of ripe experience and proved courage, who had known the ruin of Ismail's
                        days, the weary task of reconstruction that followed Tel el Kebir, the long
                        agony of the Khartoum tragedy, the slow re-conquest of the lost land from
                        barbarian oppressors, who had met representatives of the Fast and the West
                        on equal ternis in council or on the diplomatic battle-field, addressed a
                        gathering that felt more than a passing emotion to think that in two more
                        days Egypt would see no more of the statesman who had re-created and
                        enriched her. We do not, deny the able assistance that has been rendered to
                        Lord Cromer in the past by his colleagues and friends-many of whom we were
                        glad to see around him on Saturday night. No leader could afford to dispense
                        with the diplomacy of a Nabar, the courage of a Riaz, the technical
                        knowledge of a Garstin, when these high qualities were placed at his
                        service, famons swords in the administrator's armoury. But history will
                        recognise that the wielder of these weapons, the one man that could direct
                        the workers of Egypt's regeneration was the officer of artillery who became
                        Earl of Cromer and virtual ruler of Egypt-once "the little gonner" now "the
                        Lord."</p>
                    <p>Our readers will find in Lord Cromer's farewell to Egypt what we may describe
                        as the "root of the whole matter," the enunciation by a responsible
                        statesman of the two great factors of the present situation of Egypt, the
                        continuance of the Occupation and the control by the British Parliament of
                        the general administration of the country with the continuance of the
                        present system of Government, Friends and enemies alike will do well to
                        ponder over this open and unambiguous declaration. The former will be
                        encouraged by it to take a more optimistic view of the general state of
                        affairs than has been recently the fashion the latter will do well to
                        remember that it may be accounted romantic and courageous to battle with
                        facts but that common-sense forbids the exhibition of great sympathy with
                        those who, unfortified by faith, injure themselves in the vain attempt to
                        move mountains. Moreover, we would urge the erities in and out of Egypt of
                        Lord Cromer's policy and administration to remember that they and their
                        criticisms arealike Lord Cromer's creation What would have been the fate of
                        some of our most rigourous critics of to-day in Ismail Pasha's days? Exile
                        to the Sudan or the ruthless application of the grim maxim "stone dead hath
                        no fellow." What would be the fate of an editor who criticised a Turkish
                        Pasha of Egypt, with the virulence expended by a native journalist we might
                        name on the British Occupation? Banishment to the Yemen or the khanjar of a
                        wild cherkess. Let them remember that the privileges and rights-free speech,
                        free Press, free meeting-which the Western world battled and bled for 400
                        years, have been granted them through the representations of the great
                        statesman whom they affect to regard as a tyrant and that the educated
                        Egyptian regards these things as his unquestioned rights, and then -then let
                        them speak of the Tear of Kasr el Doubara." But time will only emphasise the
                        verdict of the historians of to-day and to those whom the future alarms we
                        repeat the message of the great pro-consul "Be of good courage." union,
                        courage, and trathfulness, such is Lord Cromer's political testament to the
                        heirs of his labour. Thankful for the great example he has shown his fellow
                        countrymen, we wish him long life, health, and happiness in the mother
                        country to which one of the most illustrious of her sons is returning after

                    <p>The public farewell to Lord Cromer organ-</p>
                    <p>ised by the specially appointed International Committee, which was held in
                        the Khedivial Opera House, Cairo, on Saturday afternoon, was in every way
                        worthy of the great occasion, and the committee are to be congratulated on
                        and thanked for having organised so thoroughly a representative assembly.
                        Every nationality was well represented, and throughout the meeting sincere
                        and immense enthusiasm was manifested by all. The ceremony was timed to
                        commence at six o'clock, and some time before that hour those who had been
                        able to secure tickets began to arrive. Lord Cromer arrived punctually at
                        six o'clock and as he stepped upon the platform the band of the Inniskilling
                        Fusiliers played "God Save the King." The Sirdar then called for three
                        cheers for Lord Cromer and this was responded to with unbounded enthusiasm.
                        The front row of the seats placed on the stage were occupied by Lord Cromer,
                        Sir Eldon Gorst, Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, and Connt de Serionne. In the second
                        row were the Ministers, Advisers, Under-Secretaries of States, the Sirdar,
                        Major-General Bullock, and Riaz Pasha, while the back of the stage was
                        occupied by the members of the International Committee. In the stage box on
                        the right hand side were Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel and the Princes Halim;
                        and in the left hand stage box were Lady Cromer and Lady Gorst with a number
                        of ladies.</p>

                        <p>COUNT DE SERIONNE'S SPEECH. The first speech was delivered by Count de

                        <p>My Lord-The Committee of Honour, formed since the day following the
                            announcement of your Lordship's approaching departure, represents,
                            without distinction of nationality or residence, all those who, united
                            in a deep feeling of regret and gratitude, desire to express to you with
                            all sincerity the grief which they experience in witnessing you; for
                            reasons of health, cut short a career closely associated for nearly
                            thirty years with the establishment and realisation of every kind of
                            progress, such as the prosperity of Egypt bears testimony to. His
                            Excellency Mustapha Pasha Fehmy will address you in the name of the
                            natives and the officials of the Egyptian Government. As for me, I have
                            to express to you, in the name of the Committee, whom I thank with all
                            my heart for having entrusted to me this signal honour, the feelings of
                            those who, without being attached to this country by bonds of
                            nationality or officialdom, heartily testify to you their regret and
                            their gratitude. It is not for me, gentlemen, to enumerate at this time
                            the numberless services which Lord Cromer has rendered to this country
                            since the day when he was called to collaborate in its administration as
                            Commissionner of the Public Debt up to the very hour at which he leaves

                            eloquent than all the words which I could use in retracing a career
                            which belongs to history. It is not that I would fear, in recording the
                            important acts which have marked Lord Cromer's mission in Egypt, to go
                            beyond the lines which have been traced for me Those in whose names I
                            speak have profited, equally with the local subjects, by the infinite
                            progress which makes this country one of the most prosperous regions of
                            the world, and probably the most hospitable. It is their right and duty,
                            therefore, to associate themselves with those who recapitulate to-day,
                                <cb n="2"/> as a measure of their gratitude, the acts of a career
                            made wonderful by the unity, intensity, and efficacy of the effort
                            expended. I will not, however, enter into the details of the measures of
                            every kind due to the prudent counsels of Lord Cromer, which have, as we
                            all know, gentlemen, permitted foreigners resident in this country to
                            participate so largely in its prosperity, in an atmosphere of safety and
                            tolerance, the equivalent of which it would be difficult to find in
                            other quarters of the Globe.</p>
                        <p>The Capitulations.</p>
                        <p>Allow me, however, to allude reservedly to the great conception of a new
                            organisation which Lord Cromer leaves to be carried out. You would,
                            certainly, my Lord, be pleased that I should allow myself, unofficially
                            and in no spirit of adulation, which would contrast strangely with the
                            ready sincerity of my words, to tell you that the various bolonies. of
                            Egypt unreservedly hope for the realisation of your views in this
                            matter. But what,t least, I feel myself fully authorised to declare is
                            how much all of us, without exception, have been touched by the care
                            with which you have, in preparing the project to which I refer,
                            consulted the wishes of the greatest number; how greatly. you have
                            impressed Europeans in this matter that it is your desire to work with
                            them for the more complete amelioration of their material and moral
                            tanding.</p>
                        <p>Fear nothing, gentlemen, I will not trespass further upon a ground
                            touching, whether one wills or not, on high politics. I do not forget
                            that we are only met here, my Lord, to assure you, by a manifestation in
                            which all ranks,</p>
                        <p>All classes, and all communities are united, at the moment when you are
                            on the point of leaving this beautiful land of Egypt, which ives so
                            generously to man of its most precious. Treasures, that the intelligent
                            and worthy gratitude is developed under a sun as benelicent as the
                            products of the soil, offering to ou in this hour, at once sad and
                            sweet, the ichest harvest in which you could rejoice.</p>
                        <p>Lady Cromer,</p>
                        <p>Allow me also to associate with your name, in our expression of regret
                            and respectful sympathy, the name of her who has so well Seconded by her
                            charm and her inexhaustible charity the necessarily severest qualities
                            which have been evident in your mission--a gracious associate in the
                            efforts which have each day been expended abundantly for the prosperity
                            of the country. Lady Cromer will ever live in our memories as the living
                            image of goodness, cessantly tending, as kind consolator, the aisery and
                            the sufferings of the poor. It is to fer as much as to you that we
                            address our Fishes from the depths of our hearts for the establishment
                            of your health. I such is ranted, you will long enjoy the greatest
                            recompense which can be conceded to man on arth, the delight of seeing
                            in the serenity of our retreat the grain which you have sown blooming in
                            ripe harvest.</p>
                        <p>European Gratitude.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, I have finished; but Lord romer will certainly allow me to add
                            two ords only, at the risk of exceeding for a oment the established
                            order of the programme I have just spoken in the name of the committee
                            which is constituted as I have ready indicated. My mandate is ended,
                            Fut, however, my Lord, it appears to me that would not have fulfilled in
                            entirety my ission if I did not offer for the homage of nother
                            committee, which has done me the reat honour of appointing me president.
                            It is Composed of European notables of Cairo not plding any official
                            position, but it decided give preference to the manifestation which as
                            organised after it had been constituted- manifestation more general, and
                            more fitted to offer the homage which is your due. I will not,
                            therefore, make in the name of this comfaittee a second speech; which
                            would be but repetition of that which I have just delivered. The truth
                            is one, and all the resources of thetoric which I might apply to vary,
                            more or Lass happily, the phrases destined to express ur sentiments,
                            would not be able to add to Phose two words which are alone of moment nd
                            which you will always remember, (we sk it of you, my Lord as we shall
                            guard them ithfully in ours) regret and gratitude. If, 1owever, I have
                            Abused my position of official rator in putting before you this private
                            initiative, it is because it has seemed to me that it would, perhaps,
                            enhance the tribute hich I have been bidden to offer to you,</p>
                        <p>Entente Cordiale.</p>
                        <p>My second word is more personal It seems to e my Lord that it would be
                            impossible for ise to conclude, after having spoken in the me of those
                            who have entrusted to me the xpression of their feelings, without
                            expressing the highest degree of pleasure that this honour hould be
                            confided to a Frenchman. It appears fme that I would be ungrateful if I
                            did not blicly say to my colleagues of the committee hich I represent,
                            how much I feel the delicate tention which has dictated the choice of
                            one trho should address a statesman of the foremost nk before those who
                            have more efficaciously contributed to what is so fittingly named the

                        <p>LORD CROMER'S REPLY.</p>
                        <p>The enthusiasm of the audience had risen to its utmost pitch, and amidst
                            immense and prolonged applause Count de Serionne resumed his seat. Lord
                            Cromer, then rose and replied (in French) as follows:-</p>
                        <p>Count and gentlemen: My only regret at this moment is not to possess a
                            sufficient knowledge of the beautiful French language to be able to
                            express to you in a fitting manner all the feelings of my heart. All the
                            same I would ask you to believe, Count, that I thank you most sincerely,
                            as much from my own part as from that of Lady Cromer, for the more than
                            kind words which you have just uttered. What shall I say, gentlemen, to
                            the welcome which you have so kindly given me by the flattering speech
                            of Count de Serionne? Words fail me. I can only say that it is to me a
                            revelation to know that I have so many indulgent friends up to this
                            moment. What touches especially, gentlemen, is that this meeting can be
                            considered, as I believe it to be, of a truly international character. I
                            hope that I may be allowed to draw this conclusion from it: that
                            notwithstanding the inevitable and very considerable difficulties which
                            the position which I have occupied for twenty four years presents, I
                            have not shown myself, in the opinion of several who are certainly able
                            to form a sound opinion, to be a too bad internationalist. Indeed,
                            gentlemen, I have always told myself that it was my first duty to do my
                            utmost to safeguard the interests of my own country and of Egypt. I put
                            Great Britain and Egypt in the same category because I refuse to
                            consider them apart. I uphold that, once well understood, the interests
                            of these two countries are absolutely identical. But, gentlemen, beyond
                            my quality of Englishman or Anglo-Egyptian, I have never, I hope,
                            forgotten that I am at the same time an European. The well-being of the
                            numerous and important European communities in this country is an
                            Egyptian interest and therefore a British interest of the first order.
                            It is with the thorough conviction of the truth of this fact that I
                            leave Egypt, and if opportunity and necessity arise I will not fail to
                            raise my voice in its defence. In thanking you again, gentleman, from
                            the bottom of my heart I beg you to excuse the brevity of these few
                            observations; I am shortly going to have the honour of expressing myself
                            in English.</p>

                        <p>THE PREMIER'S SPEECH.</p>
                        <p>On the conclusion of Lord Cromer's speech, which was most heartily
                            applauded, Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, President of the Council of Ministers,
                            rose and, speaking in French, said:-</p>
                        <p>My Lord:-Allow me to express to your Lordship, in the name of the
                            Government and of the great majority of the Egyptian people, the sincere
                            regret which your departure causes them a regret all the keener in that
                            your departure is necessitated by the state of your health, sacrificed
                            in the constant and excessive labour which your attachment to this
                            country and your fervent desire to incessantly contribute to its welfare
                            have imposed upon you. Egypt cannot forget, my Lord, that it is to the
                            most prudent counsels, to the help and support which you have given her,
                            that she owes a transformation which evokes a general feeling of
                            admiration. It is for history to tell and to appreciate all the progress
                            realised by this country. I only wish to emphasise that the fellah has
                            felt the benefits of the accom- plished transformation, and has
                            participated above all others in the general prosperity. By the raising
                            of her moral and material condition she has been able to experience
                            happy days. It is to this work, my Lord, that your name. will be
                            attached, and it is this which claims to-day and will always assure the
                            sincere and deep gratitude of Egypt. Allow me also to express our
                            regrets to Lady Cromer, to her who, by her goodness and her charity, has
                            gained the hearts of the misfortunate, to whom she has given relief and
                            comfort, and who has thus merited general gratitude. My Lord, you have
                            sincerely loved our Egypt, you have consecrated to it the best years of
                            your life we are then confident of the continuance of that goodwill of
                            which you have given such constant proof, and, in testifying to you our
                            deep affection, allow us to consider you always as one of us.</p>

                        <p>LORD CROMER'S SPEECH.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Premier Lord Cromer said:--</p>
                        <p>Your excellencies and gentlemen,</p>
                        <p>I must ask you to receive the remarks I am about to make with some
                            indulgence. It is, indeed, a considerable effort for me, both morally
                            and physically, to address you at allphysically, because I have to
                            muster all my strength in order to do so; morally, because I am fairly
                            overwhelmed by all the great. kindness which I have received from all
                            classes during the last few weeks, and because it costs me a very bitter
                            pang to part finally with a country where I have so many friends, and
                            with which all the incidents of my public career, as well as the joys
                            and sorrows of my domestic life, have been closely connected for well
                            nigh a generation of men. I am leaving, gentlemen, not for any political
                            reasons, but because the hand of time has begun to press hardly upon me;
                            because, after nearly half a century spent in the public <cb n="4"/>
                            service, during by far the greater portion of which I have been working
                            at high pressure, I think I am entitled to a rest; and because I feel
                            that all the very important interests over which it is the duty of the
                            British, representative to watch in this country can better be served by
                            the appointment of a younger man in the full possession of his mental
                            and physical vigour.</p>
                        <p>Lady Cromer's Work.</p>
                        <p>Before dealing with other matters, I should like to say a few words in
                            reply to the graceful allusions which both the Count de Sérionne and the
                            President of the Council have made to the lady who has been my helpmate,
                            and which have touched me and, I am sure I may add, her very deeply. I
                            might wax very eloquent on this theme, but, for obvious reasons, I will
                            exercise some control over my feelings. I confine myself to saying that,
                            whilst I was listening to the two speeches we have just heard, I felt a
                            strong desire to change places with the speakers. I should have
                            preferred to eulogise Lady Cromer, rather than to reply to the very
                            flattering remarks which have been made about myself. Perhaps I may take
                            this opportunity of saying that one of the objects which Lady Cromer has
                            had most nearly at heart has been to assist, in common with other
                            philanthropic ladies, in arresting the terrible. infant mortality in
                            this country. I venture to express a hope that this work, which has been
                            well begun, will not in future be neglected..</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer's Coadjutors.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, I am not going to dwell at any length on the history of the
                            past, neither can I allude to all of those with whom it has been my
                            privilege to co-operate in the creation of the new Egypt. I will only
                            say that I have always felt that I have had much more than my share of
                            public praise for whatever good has recently been done in this country.
                            I could have effected nothing without the hearty cooperation of
                            others-Egyptian and European,-- my own countrymen and those of other
                            nationalities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Findlay.</p>
                        <p>Amongst these, I should like to say that none has done more useful work
                            than Mr. Findlay, who, during my absence, has, of late years, acted for
                            me under circumstances of somewhat peculiar difficulty. I do not doubt
                            that, in the course of the twenty-four years during which I have held my
                            present post, I have made many mistakes, and possibly I may have
                            incurred some enmities; but your presence here this afternonn is, I
                            hope, a sufficient proof that I have also contracted. many friendships.
                            Let me add that I am particularly touched by the presence of so many of
                            my foreign colleagues, with whom, as with their predecessors, I have
                            always entertained the most friendly personal rela tions.</p>
                        <p>Khedive, Tewfik Pasha.</p>
                        <p>Although, as I have said, I cannot speak of all with whom I have
                            co-operated, yet there are one or two personalities who come so vividly
                            to my mind on the present occasion that I must perforce mention their
                            names. In the first place, I should like to say a word or two of one to
                            whom, in my opinion, the public have never, as yet, done sufficient
                            justice. I allude to the late Khedive, his Highness Tewfik Pasha,
                            Gentlemen, I am not going to use the language of empty compliment, or to
                            employ conventional phrases What I say, I mean. Tewfik Pasha understood
                            his country and his countrymen well. He constituted an admirable link
                            between the reformers, whose zeal he at times tempered, and the people,
                            whose ultra-conservative fears of reform he used his influence to allay.
                            History will be unjust if it does not accord to Tewfik Pasha a somewhat
                            important niche in the Valhalla of oriental potentates. He did not
                            himself take any very active part in the regen- eration of Egypt, but he
                            was wise enough to encourage and support those who were working for its
                            regeneration.</p>
                        <p>Nubar Pasha.</p>
                        <p>Another great figure of the past comes prominently to my mind on the
                            present occasion, Gentlemen, those who are acquainted with the past
                            history of Egypt, and who have also read my recent annual Report, will
                            recognize that the proposals I have brought forward in connection with
                            modifying the regime of the Capitulations are the natural complement of
                            the great and statesmanlike work originally projected by Nubar Pasha</p>
                        <p>Riaz Pasha.</p>
                        <p>I would mention the name of another Egyp tian statesman, whom I am glad
                            to see here this afternoon. I allude to my old and trusted friend, Riaz
                            Pasha. Gentlemen, little or no courage is now required on the part of
                            the young Egyptian who poses as a reformer. It was not so always. Ismail
                            Pasha had some very drastic methods of dealing with those who did not
                            bow before him. Nevertheless, some thirty years ago, Fiaz Pasha stood
                            forth boldly to protest against the maladministration which then
                            prevailed in Egypt. He was not afraid to bell the cat admired his
                            courage, and though, at subsequent periods, I frequently differed from
                            my old friend and colleague, I have never ceased to regard him with the
                                <cb n="5"/> esteem-I might almost say the affectionwhich his
                            sterling qualities so well merit..</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>What can I say of my I say of my valued friend, Moustapha Fehmy Pasha,
                            with whom I have been for so many years on terms of intimate personal
                            friendship? In the first place, I can say that he is one of the most
                            thorough gentlemen I have ever met in my life. Perfect loyalty,
                            straightforwardness, and truthfulness have been conspicuous in every act
                            of his life. In the second place, I can say that, in a quiet,
                            unobtrusive manner, he has rendered. the most valuable services to his
                            countrymen. I feel that these very few remarks scarcely do justice to
                            his eminent qualities, or to the personal esteem in which I hold him;
                            but I have still much to say, and I must be brief.</p>
                        <p>Boutros Chali Pasha.</p>
                        <p>It has been a great pleasure to me to be associated for so long with the
                            present Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boutros Ghali Pasha, whose
                            versatile intellect has been of the utmost service in solving many of
                            the tangled questions to which the special political situation in this
                            country so frequently gives rise.</p>
                        <p>Saad Zagloul Pasha.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, gentlemen, I should like to mention the name of one with whom I
                            have only recently co-operated, but for whom, in that short time, I have
                            learned to entertain a high regard. Unless I am much mistaken, a career
                            of great public usefulness lies before the present Minister of
                            Education, Saad Zagloul Pasha He possesses all the qualities necessary
                            to serve his country. He is honest; he is capable; he has the courage of
                            his convictions; he has been abused by many of the less worthy of his
                            own countrymen. These are high qualifications. He should go far.</p>
                        <p>European Coadjutors.</p>
                        <p>Of my European coadjutors, all I need say is that I thank them all most
                            heartily for the invaluable help and support which I have received from
                            them, under circum stances of great difficulty. I cannedertake to
                            mention all their names, but if there be any whose names deserve
                            specially to be cherished by the people of this country, they are,
                            perhaps, Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff, Sir William Garstin, and their able
                            subordinates, who have given the Egyptians what they most of all
                            require-water. And to these I may add the name of a distinguished
                            Frenchman, M. Maspero, whose erudite researches into the past history of
                            Egypt have rightly secured for him a fame which is worldwide.</p>
                        <p>Sir Reginald Wingate.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, gentlemen, I wish to say that no part of my duties has interested
                            me more than that connected with the Sudan. It will always be a source
                            of pride and satisfaction to me that I have been associated with Sir
                            Reginald Wingate and his zealous and capable coadjutors in the
                            remarkable work of regeneration which has for some years past been
                            proceeding in that country.</p>
                        <p>The People's Gratitude.</p>
                        <p>With the help of those I have mentioned, and many others, we have, I
                            think, in spite of many shortcomings, done a good piece of work here
                            during the last quarter of a century. I am often told that the Egyptians
                            generally fail to show any great amount of gratitude for the benefits
                            which have unquestionably been conferred upon them. I do not know what
                            their feelings are in this respect. A French philosopher once said
                            something to this effect- I cannot quote the words exactly.</p>
                        <p>"Lorsqu'un peuple a trop souffert c'est à peine qu'il a la force de
                            remercier ceux qui le sauve," and assuredly the people of Egypt in past
                            times suffered grievously. Whatever may be their feelings, I refuse to
                            be reasoned out of what, if it be a delusion, is at all events a noble
                            delusion. I refuse to believe that the Egyptians, or at all events the
                            best amongst them, do not recognize that it was the hand of western
                            civilization, acting mainly, during the last twenty-five years, through
                            the instru mentality of England, that raised them from the slough of
                            despond in which their lot was formerly cast, and pointed out to them
                            the way which leads to material prosperity and to moral elevation of
                            thought. And if, which is far from being the case, I were convinced that
                            the present generation does not recognize this manifest truth, I should
                            still cherish the hope that their posterity will do so. I believe it is
                            a fact that the children of the blind are able</p>
                        <p>to see.</p>
                        <p>Two Prinolpal Objects.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, when I first came to this coun try to occupy my present
                            position, there were two principal objects which I set before myself,
                            and which I steadily pursued for a long term of years. One was
                            political; the other was administrative. L'Entente Francaise.</p>
                        <p>The main political object I kept in view was to contribute to the
                            restoration of that good understanding between France and England which
                            the force of circumstances, rather than any intentions or ambitions on
                            the part of the rulers of populations of either country, had <cb n="6"/>
                            impaired. That very distinguished statesmen, M. Gambetta, whose
                            masterful will during the period he was in office exercised an abiding
                            effect on the course of Egyptian history, once said to his countrymen,
                            "Ne rompez jamais avec l'alliance anglaise." My creed in international
                            politics, which is, I believe, shared by a large number of my
                            countrymen, may almost be summed up in the phrase, "Ne rompez jamais
                            avec l'entente française." This entente, to which Count de Serionne has
                            alluded in sympathetic terms, is based on common interests, on close
                            neighbourhood, on community of political institutions, on the mutual
                            respect acquired by past rivalry in arms on many a well-fought field,
                            and on a recognition of the fact that the characteristics and qualities,
                            of the two nations serve as a complement to each other. Further, it
                            threatens no one; it is based on a common desire to maintain the peace
                            of the world. If ever there were two nations marked out by the force of
                            circumstances to be friends, they are certainly France and England.</p>
                        <p>The Rankling Sore.</p>
                        <p>Well, gentlemen, it was clear to the merest tyro in diplomacy that, so
                            long as this Egyptian sore continued to rankle, that friendship would
                            necessarily be impaired. Therefore, when I came to Egypt in 1883, 1
                            determined, so far as the limited sphere of my action enabled me to do
                            so, to use my utmost endeavours to repair the breach. It was a long,
                            uphill work. For years the two nations looked at each other
                            askance-comme deux chiens de faience, as our French friends would say.
                            We exchanged some hard, but fortunately, only verbal knocks. I came in
                            for my fair share of them. There was a time when my name was rarely
                            mentioned in a Freach newspaper without the addition of some rather
                            uncomplimentary epithet, of which, I think, " le brutal Cromer" was that
                            which was most commonly used. Indeed, if I remember rightly, I was on
                            one occasion likened to the most bloodthirsty of heathen gods. I was
                            termed Moloch. These journalistic amenities, which give zest and life to
                            political discussion, need not be taken too seriously, more especially
                            as they are now, happily, things of the past. Recently, I have been on
                            more than one occasion termed, " cet illustre vieillard, "which clearly
                            denotes a change of tone.</p>
                        <p>A Happy Day.</p>
                        <p>Seriously, however, gentlemen, I did my best. for many years to lead up
                            to an understanding between the two nations, and I may say that one of
                            the happiest days of my Egyptian career was April 8th, 1904, when the
                            Anglo-French Agreement was signed. I do not, of course, for one moment,
                            claim to have been one of the principal authors of that Agreement. The
                            chief merit of its conclusion lies with the statesmen who conducted the
                            foreign affairs of either country, in Paris and in London, and also, I
                            trust I may be allowed to add without disrespect, with the talented
                            sovereign whom I have had the privilege to serve. But I think I may go
                            so far as to say that the continuous efforts made, by all concerned, in
                            Egypt, over a series of years, to avoid unnecessary friction, and to
                            deal in a frank and friendly spirit with any small grievances which
                            arose out of the fact of the British occupation of Egypt, paved the way
                            to a settlement, and facilitated the work of the negotiators.</p>
                        <p>Autooraoy and Tyranny.</p>
                        <p>I turn now to the administrative object which I have always kept in view.
                            I have recently been hearing a good deal of wild talk about the
                            autocratic and tyrannical government of Egypt. I do not care to answer
                            eriticisms of this sort at any length. I may, however, say that
                            throughout my Egyptian career I have done my best to instil a liberal
                            spirit into a system of government which was of necessity bureaucratic.
                            I have certainly always endeavoured, to the best of my ability, to
                            ascertain the true state of public opinion, whether European or local,
                            and to give due weight to it. I must leave it for others to decide how
                            far I have succeeded.</p>
                        <p>Egypt's Moral Advancement.</p>
                        <p>I turn to another point. I hear it frequently stated that, although the
                            material prosperity of Egypt has increased marvellously of late years,
                            nothing has been done towards the moral and intellectual advancentent of
                            the people. What, gentlemen, has there been no moral advancement? Is the
                            country any longer governed, as was formerly the case, exclusively by
                            the use of the whip? Is not forced labour a thing of the past? Has not
                            the accursed institution of slavery practically ceased to exist? Is it
                            not a fact that every individual in the country, from the highest to the
                            lowest, is now equal in the eyes of the law; that thrift has been
                            encouraged, and that the most humble member of society can reap the
                            fruits of his own labour and industry that justice is no longer bought
                            and sold; that every one is free-perhaps some would think too free-to
                            express his opinions; that King Backsheech has been dethroned from high
                            places and now only lingers in the purlieus and byways of the
                            administration; that the fertilizing water of the Nile is distributed
                            impartially to prince and peasant alike; that the sick man can be tended
                            in a well-equipped, hospital; that the criminal and the lunatic are no
                            longer treated</p>

                            devoted to purposes which are of real benefit to the country? If all
                            there, and many other points to which I could allude, do not constitute
                            some moral advaficement, then, of a truth, I do not know what the word
                            morality implies.</p>
                        <p>Female Education.</p>
                        <p>I am told, however, that the intellect, as well as the morality, of the
                            Egyptians has been neglected. To this statement also give a most
                            emphatic denial. Look at the case of female education. Can any thinking
                            man sup pose that this country can really imbibe the true spirit of
                            civilisation until the, posit on of women has been changed? If so, I
                            venture entirely to differ from him. Well gentlemen, some few years ago,
                            my distinguished friend Yacoub Artin Pasha, Kassim Bey Aming and a very
                            few others, alone took any intrist in this question. The rest of the
                            population were not merely indifferent; they were</p>
                        <p>absolutely hostile. Look at the change how The Egyptian Government has
                            not got schools enough to provide for all the girls whose parents wish
                            them to be educated..</p>
                        <p>Elementary Education.</p>
                        <p>Then again, look at the subject of elementary education. The system which
                            existed before the British occupation began was absolutely worthless.
                            Here again there has been a r markable change. Village schools, under
                            the influence of many of the most enlightene of the provincial notables
                            are springing u all over the country. A remarkable moviment has also
                            taken place in favour of indis ial education.</p>
                        <p>Higher Education.</p>
                        <p>As to higher education-that is to say he teaching of law, medicine,
                            engineering an so on-there has been a steady advance for many years
                            along the whole line. I quite admi that if, twenty years ago, unlimited
                            funds nd been at the disposal of the Governmen a great deal more might
                            have been done. The main factor in the Egyptian problem, hower, was
                            that, not only were the funds avalle far from being unlimited, but, for
                            many yes, they were barely sufficient for the pressing needs of the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>An Exalted Ally.</p>
                        <p>st</p>
                        <p>Of course, a great deal still remains to be done in the way of moral and
                            intellectual progress, and I have every confidence than the good, hands
                            of the present Ministe f Education and of his Adviser, Mr. Du, rapid
                            progress in educational matters l be made. Moreover, a very competent
                            exalted ally has recently come into th field in connection with this
                            subjec read, a short time ago, in the newspapers an interview which his
                            Highness the Khe had accorded to a French newspaper co pondent, His
                            Highness made the follow h remarks. He said that "international con for
                            the Egyptian debt was henceforth at end." I may remark incidentally
                            that, for time being, this remark is quite correct; bet am very fully
                            convinced that if reality wre given to many of the wild schemes of
                            Egyptan reform of which we have lately heard a gd deal, international
                            concern in the finance of the country would very soon be quickened into
                            life. I need not, however, dwell on this po His Highness then went on to
                            say: "It is tie to devote all our efforts, not only towards material
                            welfare of the population, but towa the satisfaction of their
                            intellectual and mo requirements. For my part, I have no mere serious
                            pre-occupation than that." I heart welcome this declaration. Khedivial
                            Influence.</p>
                        <p>His Highness can, more especially, do great deal in the way of the moral
                            advang ment of the people. He can put a stop to te scandals of the Wakfs
                            Administration, which exercise so demoralizing an effect in this
                            country. He can show his co-religionists that the Mohamedan law-courts
                            can be reforme without in any way shaking the pillars of the Moslem
                            faith, He can sternly repress ti proceedings of the self-seeking and
                            irrespon sible advisers who generally cluster round an Oriental court
                            and whose influence is so detri mental to public morality. He can use hi
                            great influence to encourage true reformer who have the well-being of
                            their country earnestly at heart. If, as I trust will be the his
                            Highness will do these things, he will earn the gratitude and respect of
                            every class in the country.</p>
                        <p>case,</p>
                        <p>The British Occupation. Gentlemen, I fear, I weary you; but I have so far
                            dealt with the past; if you will grant me your attention for a few
                            minutes longer, T should wish to make some remarks about the future.
                            What are the main facts as regards the Egyptian situation? The first is
                            that the British occupation is to continue for an inde finite period. On
                            this point we have the formal assurance of His Majesty's Government. The
                            second point is that, so long as that occupation continues, the British
                            Government must of necessity be responsible, not, indeed, for the
                            details, but for the main lines on which the administration is
                            conducted. On this second point, there ought, I think, to be no manner
                            of doubt The conclusion I draw from these facts is that the present
                            system of govern ment, in spite of its numerous defects and anomalies
                            which no one recognizes more fully. than myself-must be continued; and I
                            believe that no one is more capable of safe guarding its continuance
                            than my very able successor, Sir Eldon Gorst..</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>Bir Eldon Corst.</p>
                        <p>You all of you know Sir Eldon Gorst's merits too well for it to be
                            necessary to dweil at length on his eminent qualities. I will,
                            therefore, only say that nothing has afforded me greater pleasure than
                            to know that my place is to be taken by one for whom I entertain such a
                            warm personal friendship, and in whom I have such thorough confidence,
                            as Sir Eldon Gorst. I see from the utterance of the press, both European
                            and local, that Sir Eldon Gorst is strongly advised to follow what is
                            called "my policy." I had therefore better explain what "my policy" has
                            been. It may be summed up in a very few words. It has been to tell the
                            truth. I know Sir Eldon Gorst will follow that policy. I do not doubt,
                            gentlemen, that in the performance of his arduous duties Sir Eldon Gorst
                            will receive the same loyal and efficient support, from his own
                            countrymen and others, as has uniformly been vouch safed to me. Never
                            forget, gentlemen, that in this country the maxim that "union is
                            strength" must be fully applied if a complete measure of beneficial
                            effect is to be produced.</p>
                        <p>Spurious Nationalism.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, I am not likely in the future to take any very active part in
                            politics,, but I shall continue, so far as my health and strength allow
                            me, to take an interest in Egyptian affairs. Whatever influence I can
                            exert will be exercised in the direction of steady progress on the lines
                            already laid down. I shall deprecate any brisk change, and any violent
                            new departure. More especially, should it be necessary, I shall urge
                            that this wholly spurious and manufactured movement in favour of a rapid
                            development of parliamentary institutions should be treated for what it
                            is worth and, gentlemen, let me add that it is worth very little. It
                            does not really represent the voice of the intelligent dwellers in
                            Egypt, whether European or Egyptian. When all the nonsense and
                            exaggeration are swept away, it will I think, be found that the
                            difference of opinion between my opponents, especially those in England,
                            and myself is really not SO much one of principle as one of degree. They
                            wish to gallop. I consider that a steady jog trot is the pace best
                            suited to advance the interests of this country. It is a pace which has
                            done us good service in the past. I say it should be continued, never
                            relaxing into a walk, or breaking into a gallop; and my strong
                            conviction is that if the pace be greatly mended, a serious risk will be
                            incurred that the horse will come down and break its knees.</p>
                        <p>The Voiceless Millions.</p>
                        <p>I wish to tell you, gentlemen, why I entertain and why I now state these
                            opinions. It is not because I hold that any political advantage will
                            accrue to my own country from their adoption. It is not even because I
                            believe them to be shared by all the most intelligent classes, whether
                            European or Egyptian, in this country. No, gentlemen; it is mainly
                            because I hope that what I am now saying will eventually be translated
                            into the verna cular language and will thus reach the ears of some, at
                            all events, of the voiceless millions, the blue-shirted fellaheen, on
                            whose labours the prosperity of his country really depends. I, who claim
                            always to have been their true friend, warn them against allowing
                            themselves. to be duped and misled by their pseudo-repre sentatives,
                            who, without a shadow of real authority, credit them with ideas which
                            they neither entertain nor fully comprehend, and who advocate a
                            political programme the immediate adoption of which, whilst detrimental
                            to all other interests, would, I am firmly con- vinced, be specially
                            hurtful to those of the poorest classes of the community.</p>
                        <p>Too fast Progress.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, if, instead of being a defender of the régime which has now
                            lasted nearly a quarter of a century, I were to turn my hand to
                            criticising it, I should be disposed to dwell on the point that
                            progress, far from having been too slow, has been so fast that the
                            reforms which have been effected have not as yet been thoroughly
                            assimilated by the mass of the population.</p>
                        <p>Union is Strength,</p>
                        <p>There is yet one further word of advice which I wish to give before I sit
                            down. The maxim that "union is strength" applies not merely to those who
                            are in the service of the Government, but to all who are interested in
                            the introduction of true civilization into this country. They should
                            hold together. I do not merely mean that the Englishman, the Frenchman,
                            the German, and other Europeans should lay aside their petty

                        <p>of Cood Cheer.</p>
                        <p>Gentlemen, I thank you for the patience with which you have listened to
                            me. I have how said all I have to say. I do not doubt that difficulties
                            still lie in the path of the Egyptian reformer, and especially in that
                            of Sir Eldon Gorst; but my last word to him and to all of you may fitly
                            be an inscription which, in former days, was frequently inscribed by the
                            vershippers of Isis in this country on their torabs. It was in the
                            language used by that nation which was the true parent of European
                            evilization, whose descendants have to a large extent, and to the great
                            advantage of the country, settled in Egypt, and amongst whom I am
                            pleased to count many excellent friends. I need hardly say that I refer
                            to the language of Greece. The inscription to, which I allude was
                            "Eupsuchei," which, being translated into English, means, "Be of good
                            cheer." Gentlene, with full confidence in the future of the Hou try
                            which has been my home for so many <cb n="3"/> years, and in which the
                            germs of true civilization have now, I firmly believe, fastened too
                            deeply. in the soil to be easily uprooted, I reluctantly bid you a
                            grateful farewell.</p>
                        <p>We understand that Lord Cromer, although naturally very fatigued after
                            his great effort on Saturday and the leave-taking of yesterday, is none
                            the worse for his exertions. His lordship the worse for his exe has
                            expressed himself as greatly touched by the warmth and sincerity of the
                            farewell which he received from all classes, both European and
                            native.</p>

                        <p>The "Times," commenting on Lord Cromer's speech, says that the Khedive
                            may do much by personal action in the domain of educational and moral
                            reform in the manner Lord Cromer suggested. He can thus play an
                            honourable part in the regeneration of his country, but whether he
                            adopts this course or not the regeneration will go on, as it depends on
                            the pillars of the British occupation and the responsibility of the

                            denounces the agitators whose childish demands for the application of a

                        <p>ENTHUSIASTIC FAREWELL.</p>
                        <p>Some time before Lord and Lady Cromer were timed to leave the British
                            Agency crowds had begun to line the streets along which they were to
                            pass on their way to the rail way station All the hotel verandahs were
                            crowded with sight-seers and the windows and Ealconies of the houses
                            along the line o! route were filled with spectators. Large numbars of he
                            populace assembled on the pavement and the thousands of native
                            sight-seers preserved a most respectful demeanour throughout. All
                            traffic was stopped after 10.30 o'clock and the troops of the Army of
                            Ocenpation lined the route from the Rond Point Suares to the railway
                            station. The Rond Point was occupied by the Military Mounted Police and
                            from thence to the station the roads were lined by the Royal
                            Inniskilling Fusiliers, the Royal Engineers, the Army Service Corps, 1st
                            Battalion Kings Own Scottish Borderers, Coldstream Guards, U. Battery of
                            the Royal Horse Artillery, and the Inniskilling Dragoons Lord and Lady
                            Cromer left the British Agency at a quarter to eleven and after passing
                            the Rond Point Suares, drove along Sharieh el Manakh, the Opera square,
                            Sharieh Kamel, and Sharieh Bab el-Hadid to the station. Their carriage
                            was preceded by an escort of eight men and a sergeant of the
                            Inniskilling Dragoons At the station there was a guard of honour of
                            fifty rank and file, with two officers, the regimental colour, and drums
                            and fifes of the "Coldstream Guards. They were drawn up on platform
                            number 4 at which the special train, which was to convey his Lordship to
                            Port Said was waiting. When Lord Cromer arrived at the station shortly
                            after eleven o'clock the Royal Garrison Artillery began to fire a salute
                            of fifteen guns from the citadel. The departure platform was filled with
                            a representative gathering of high officials, including the Ministers, a
                            number of personal friends of Lord and Lady Crorer, the members of the
                            Diplomatic and Consular Corps, leading representatives of the European
                            colonies and others. Lord and Lady Cromer shook hands with all present
                            and the train departed amidst ringing cheers.</p>
                        <p>It was remarked that outside the station the rative populace clapped as
                            Lord Cromer's carriage drew up. The police arrangements were excellent
                            and not a single unpleasant incident occurred to mar the proceedings.
                            The special train was in charge of Mr. Trevithick and was drawn by the
                            engine named after Lady Cromer. It is an experimental engine of the
                            Atlantic type, fitted with superheaters and built by the North British
                            Company. The train consisted of twelve coaches,</p>

                        <p>FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. Port Said, Monday. Lord and Lady Cromer
                            embarked on board the P. &amp; O. R. M. S. Egypt this afternoon. The
                            distinguished passengers, who arrived by special train punctually at
                            3.30 p.m., were met at the station by Mr. D. A. Cameron, C.B., H. B.
                            M's. Consul, Captain Langford Clarke, RN., Commander of H.M.S. Minerva,
                            Mr. Watson, Chief Inspector of the Port Said-Suez line, and a large
                            crowd of residents. Lord and Lady Cremer, accompanied by Mr. Cameron and
                            Captain Clarke, drove to the front of the Canal Company's offices where
                            they were met by Moheb Pasha, Governor of the Suez Canal, Khalil Bey
                            Riad, Sub-Governor Schalch Bey, Commandant of Police, Admiral Blomfield,
                            Dixon Bey, Snow Bey, Mr. Dumont, Principal Agent of the Canal Company
                            and Mr. Coullant, Chief of Transit, Mr. John Tarell, Director of

                            and many others far too numerous <cb n="4"/> to mention. The natives
                            were very well represented and were probably in the majority and his
                            Lordship was deeply touched by the kind words of sympathy in which they
                            expressed their regret at their loss.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Snow presented Lady Cromer with a bouquet of flowers. Among the many
                            with whom her Ladyship conversed were Mrs. and the Misses Strange, Miss
                            Dixon, Dr. and Mrs. Hayward, and others. Lord Cromer was presented with
                            an address by Mr. Legrand in the name of Port Said. The address was
                            signed by many hundreds of local residents, including all nationalities.
                            After the presenta tion Lord Cromer, who appeared, very tired after his
                            journey, made a short speech of thanks, and was greatly affected by the
                            cordial wishes of all who could get near him.</p>
                        <p>His Lordship and Lady Cromer were escorted on board the ligypt by Mr.
                            Cameron and Captain Clarke and were received at the gangway by Mr.
                            Tweedie, Agent of the P.&amp;.O. Co. at Port Said, and the Commander of

                        <p>LORD CROMER'S REPLY.</p>
                        <p>The following is the text of the letter sent by Lord Cromer to Mr. Robert
                            J. Moss, Bulkeley, in reply to the address sent to his Lordship by
                            British subjects resident in Alexandria and the neighbourhood:-</p>
                        <p>Sir, I have received from Mr. Foster the address with which I have been
                            honoured by the members of the British Community of Alexandria and the
                            neighbourhood. I find it difficult to express adequately my sense of the
                            kind and friendly feeling towards myself which is evinced in this
                            address, or my acknowledgements of the complimentary terms in which
                            reference is made to my past work in this country. I can only ask you to
                            accept, and to convey to the gentlemen who have signed the address, my
                            sincere and heartfelt thanks for the honour which they have done me.
                            This beautiful volume will always remain amongst my most valued
                            possessions, and will be equally treasured by my sons; I may say with
                            truth that leaving Egypt as I do with great regret, I find no slight
                            consolation in the proof thus afforded of the kind sentiments
                            entertained by so large a d important a body of my fellowcountrymen,</p>
                        <p>I am glad to take advantage of this oppor tunity to say that for many
                            years past it has been to me a matter of great regret that circumstances
                            have not allowed of my visiting Alexandria more frequently, and thus
                            entering into closer personal relations with many, with whom my
                            acquaintance has been less intimate than 1 should have wished.</p>
                        <p>I hope and believe, however, that my situation in this respect has not
                            been in any way misunderstood. Whether in my public or private capacity,
                            I appreciate so strongly and so gratefully the numerous occasions on
                            which it has been my privilege to recognise the generosity and public
                            spirit, or the personal kindness of the British Community of Alexandria,
                            that I cannot myself feel otherwise than identified with the interests
                            of your great city and of the powerful body of subjects of His Majesty
                            who, to the mutual advantage of Egypt and of the British Empire, have
                            made that city their home.</p>
                        <p>I trust that I may have in future years the pleasure of hearing of the
                            continued happiness and welfare of all the members of that Community, to
                            whom I again tender the expression of my grateful thanks.</p>

                    <head>SHEM EL NESSIM</head>
                    <p>AN UNEVENTFUL DAY.</p>
                    <p>Shem el Nessim day of 1907 has passed by, and we have no massacres to
                        report-nothing but a peaceful, eventless day; a day even less notable than
                        any ordinary working day. True, the number of police on daty was in-
                        creased, and police officers and superintendents were more than usually en
                        evidence; true, too, that a considerable force of British troops, carrying
                        rifles and provided with ten rounds of ammunition, marched round Alexandria
                        in the morning. But these unusual precautions for the maintenance of public
                        safety were only deemed advisable owing to the remarkable state of
                        nervousness into which a large section of the European community had worked
                        itself.</p>
                    <p>A rumour, ill-timed, mischievous, and ungrounded, emanating for the
                        provinces, that Shem el Nessim would witness a massacre; isolated cases of
                        attacks on Europeans by natives accompanied by similar threats; and warnings
                        here and there by Berberin servants had, in face of an obvious state of
                        quiet among the natives, sufficed to excite the European community to a
                        state bordering upon panic. As we pointed out in a recent issue, it is under
                        just such conditions that a spirit of restlessness is provoked among the
                        lower classes of natives. When the donkey-boy, bootblack, arbagi, bowab,
                        sufragi, etc., realise that the Franks fear trouble from them, it only
                        requires an insignificant incident to create a riotous mob, such as was
                        witnessed in the Hamami incident of December 1905. The strikes of Cairo had
                        doubtless contributed to the general uneasiness, and following on these came
                        the unfounded rumours that a caravan of 5,000 Martini rifles had been seized
                        near Mariout, and another thousand at Damanhour, that the Green Howards were
                        on their way from Malta and another battalion was waiting for orders to
                        embark for this country, and that eight British men-of-war were waiting ont
                        at sea in sight of Alexandria. Such rumours naturally made those who
                        believed them think that the Government itselt feared a serious rising and
                        was taking every step to immediately suppress it The European public,
                        however, can rest assured, and perhaps the calm of the great Mohammedan
                        festival will help to convince them, that Egypt to-day is experiencing a
                        peacefulness equal to that of any country, and which the machinations of no
                        spurious nationalist party will break. Too great an importance has been
                        attached to the recent strikes. Strikes occur in every country, and even in
                        the most advanced countries mobs injurious to the public peace not
                        infrequently accompany them.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we would counsel our readers not, to place too much faith in
                        disquieting rumours, not to assume too much from isolated cases of
                        anti-European outrages, not to confound the objectionable Berberin servant
                        class with the usually placid fellah, and, above all, to place no trust in
                        the loud ery re-iterated by a certain interested party of pseudo-national-
                        ists of dissatisfaction with the British Occupa tion The energetic,
                        misguided interference, of certain Members of Parliament in the Government
                        of Egypt under British guidance may persuade those at home who have not
                        hitherto interested themselves in Egypt and, therefore, have little
                        knowledge of the country, to doubt the thorough wisdom of our policy, but
                        we, who have made the Land of the Pharoahs our. home, know full well the
                        marvels which Lord Cromer and his coadjutors have accomplished; and
                        moreover, we realise (and have we not, at the moment of departure of Great
                        Britain's world-famous Minister Plenipotentiary, received undeniable
                        testimony?) that the great mass of Egypt's populace bears an infinite
                        gratitude for Great Britain's regeneration of one of the most fertile lands
                        of the world. Again we remark, there is not the slightest cause for
                        nervousness, which, in itself, constitutes a certain danger, for nervousness
                        often leads to acts of folly.</p>
                    <p>IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>Shem el Nessim passed off most tranquilly at Cairo yesterday. While many
                        Europeans dreaded an outbreak on the part of the natives, a large section of
                        the latter laboured under the impression that they were to be attacked by
                        the troops after Lord Cromer had left. The result was that the trains were
                        far less patronised than usual and everybody behaved in a most exemplary
                        fashion there being no rowdiness or disorder!</p>

                        <p>It has been ascertained that a coach of King Edward's train had to be
                            detached after leaving the Simplon Tunnel, an axle having become over
                            heated owing to a grease box having fallin off.</p>
                        <p>A Geneva paper asserts that the bolts and pins of the latter had
                            evidently been extracted. A porter's accidental discovery of the mishap
