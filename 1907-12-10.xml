                    <head>A RESULT OF THE CRISIS.</head>
                    <p>One of the most awkward results of the acute financial crisis prevailing in
                        Egypt is the stoppage of all offers for the new quay lands. Some critics
                        assert that the Alexandria Municipality is partly to be blamed for having
                        encouraged speculation by permitting payments for the quay lands to be made
                        on the instalment system, thus permitting of speculators with but little
                        capital making offers for the land with the intention of selling it at
                        enhanced profits, and now these persons cannot pay up. Now all the sales
                        have come to a complete standstill and the Municipality does not know which
                        way to turn for money. It had been calculated that the Municipality would
                        have been able to sell the lands at a fair prices and the proceeds would
                        have gone on the great drainage works and the expropriations necessary for
                        opening up certain insanitary quarters of the city. Bat all hopes of
                        disposing of the land have to be abandoned for some time to come, for nobody
                        knows when the "reprise," which we all long for so eagerly, will arrive. The
                        consequence is that the Municipality finds itself with a large and highly
                        paid staff of engineers, whose services were engaged for carrying out the
                        proposed drainage scheme, but unfortunately there is no money to go on with
                        this important enterprise, for all the cash in hand in the municipal coffers
                        is already earmarked. The administrator of the Municipality therefore
                        proposes to draw on the account current up to say L.E. 1,000,000. The
                        Municipality would pay in the amount coming in from the sale of lands in
                        order to wipe it off. All expenditure drawn from this sum would be
                        controlled by the Government, which would have the power of vetoing any
                        expense. It is considered that such a scheme would be far better than a
                        loan, as there is no need to spend all the money at once and if a loan was
                        raised, which could only be managed with the consent of the Powers, a great
                        deal of the money would lie idle In the report on the municipal budget for
                        1908 the administrator alludes to the project in the following words :-</p>
                    <p>"Je proposerais dans ce but. l'ouverture d'une avance en compte courant de
                        1.000.000 de L.E. apprès de la calgae de la Dette Publique ou d'une ou de
                        plusieurs banques de notre Ville avec la garantie du Gouvernement, ou auprès
                        du Gouvernement loi-même, assuré par l'affectation des terrains du Quai.
                        Cette opération' de trésorerie aura l'avantage sur un emprunt de ne pas
                        immobiliser des fonds mais de nous procurer l'argent au fur et à mesure de
                        nos besoins, diminuant ainsi les intérêts que la Ville sera appelée à payer
                        aux créanciers........ "La somme de 1 million ne sera naturellement pas
                        affectée dans une seule, année, et il sera toujours possible à la
                        Commission, si la crise continuait et si l'avenir ne s'éclaircissait pas, de
                        s'abstenir d'engager d'autres dépenses et de | limiter le debit de la
                        Municipalité au chiffre répondant aux besoins les plus stricts. Il est à
                        présumer du reste que les travaux auxquels les sommes seront consacrées
                        exigeront plusieurs années pour être complétés et étant donné les rentrées
                        qu'entre temps la Municipalité effectuera an moyen de la vente de ses
                        terrains, le montant du debit n'absorbera jamais une somme considérable du
                        compte ouvert. Au cas où cette combinaison ne rous. sirait pas, il faudra de
                        toute façon rechercher les moyens de pouvoir augmenter les facultés
                        d'emprunt de la Municipalite."</p>
                    <p>It is not believed that the Government will countenanoe the scheme, but as it
                        is absolutely necessary to go on with the drainage of the city, it is
                        essential that money should be found in some way or other.</p>

                            would pay. He said that he paid the balance of the £60, promised by him
                            for his promotion to chief store-keeper, to Attiah Effendi George in
                            1906 and that on reading a Government circular prohibiting the payment

                        <p>At 4 p.m. yesterday the Advocate Wissa Boctor began his defence of Attia
                            George, who was transferred to the Finance Ministry and had excellent
                            certificates from his chiefs espécially from Talamaz Bey. He also
                            pointed out that Admiral Sir M. Blomfield had recommended Attia for
                            promotion in 1907.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of Parquet then proceeded to show how Attia had falsified
                            documents and spread corruption in the Administration and proved how he
                            and Spiro Bey arranged together to receive bribes, etc. He asked the

                        <p>The Court rose at 6 p.m. and reassembled at 7 p.m. to hear the case

                        <p>The Chief of the Parquet showed how Safwat and Mossalam Suleiman tried by

                            Mamogrof the Rosetta Ports and Lights, and to give the money to Spiro

                            Safwat kept L.E. 10 of the L.E. 40 for himself besides 5 tins of butter

                        <p>Safwat confessed that he received these articles, but he paid for them
                            with the exception of the 5 tins of butter, which he sent to Spiro Bey,

                        <p>Sir.--Your correspondent "Lex" in his letter published in your issue of
                            Saturday raises a point which is of far more importance to holders of
                            shares in companies registered under the English Companies Acts than
                            they yet realize. The grave disadvantage of compary directors of foreign
                            nationality not being responsible for breaches of the Companies Acts is,
                            to my mind, considerably aggravated by the fact that in the vast
                            majority of cases their employés and secretary are equally ignorant of
                            the requirements and formalities of the Acts under which they work.
                            Should any of these companies be forced into liquidation, or litigation
                            be involved owing to the failure of others, there will doubtless be many
                            unpleasant surprises awaiting the unfortunate investor.</p>
                        <p>To name a few of the instances in which trouble is bound to arise. Some
                            companies have been mortgaging their properties without registering the
                            deeds at the Companies Registration Office in spite of the stringency of
                            the Acts on this subject. Calls have been and are being made not in
                            accordance with the articles. Transfers not in order are accepted and
                            passed, Shares are improperly cancelled after forfeiture and re-issued.
                            New Directors are improperly appointed. Apparently the officials of some
                            companies have not even read an elementary text book on company
                            management nor had sufficient sense to employ a properly qualified
                            solicitor to advise them.</p>

                            of person, who in the evening throng the neighbourhood of the Ramleh
                            Boulevard, Cleopatra street, etc. Last night I was escorting a lady
                            friend from my house to her home and was appalled at what I not only saw
                            but heard. The police seemed to regard the spectacle as a joke and
                            seemed to be on quite friendly terms with the parties.</p>
                        <p>Truly Yours, </p>
                        <byline>EP. WAKEHAM. </byline>

                        <p>During the past few days quite a number of visitors have passed through
                            here, some being old residents while others were paying their first
                            visit. Inbuch a small community, villtors, whether strangers or
                            otherwise are always welcome, even for the sake of seeing a fresh face
                            or adding one more to the circle at the club, where their latest stock
                            of yarns will receive full appreciation. Among our recent visitors may
                            be mentioned Major Ravenscroft, Repression of Slavery Dept, who only
                            returned to Khartoum the other day after a stay extending nearly three
                            weeks, occupied in inspection and other work connected with this part of
                            the Department, and also Captain Fielden, Senior Inspector, Port Sudan.
                            Mr. Somerville of the Veterinary Department returned from a visit of
                            Inspection extending as far south as the Eretrean Frontier. It is very
                            satisfactory to note that the entire district was found to be free from
                            cattle plague. By train on the evening of the 29th ult. there was quite
                            an influx of visitors including Major Coutts, Inspector of prisons from
                            Khartoum on Inspection Duty, and Bimbashi Fouth, Camel Corps, for
                            purchase of camels, Mr. J. F. Luard, Manager Khartoum Branch, Bank of
                            Egypt and Mrs: Luard, Mr. Job, Inspector of the National Bank. Major
                            Coutts, and Mr. and Mrs. Luard returned to Khartoum again in the evening
                            of the 29th ult.</p>

                        <p>Friday the 28th ult. was quite a red letter day. On this date the opening
                            of the range of the Red Sea Railway Rifle Club took place at Graham's
                            point. In response to the invitation of the members of the club to an
                            "at home," quite a large gathering assembled at 3 pm. when the first
                            shot was fired by El Miralai C, J. Hawker Bey, Governor of the Province;
                            with a well directed shot he placed the bullet on the bull's-eye.</p>
                        <p>The next event was an Open Sweepstake Competition, Entrance P. T. 10.
                            "Stakes to be divided into 3 prizes. Conditions 200yards and 500yard, 7

                            impossible. Reid was declared the winter, having made a better score at
                            the longer distance.</p>

                            the club on their excellent range. A vote of thanks was passed to
                            Bimbashi Russell for undertaking the marking, and carrying it out so
                            efficiently Mr. R. Fawkes acted as range officer, and kept the scores to
                            the satisfaction of all.</p>
                        <p>The thanks of the community are due to Bimbashi Russell for forming the
                            club, which though ostensibly for the Railway Employés, admits other
                            residents as honorary members. The range is quite up to date in every
                            particular, with telephonic communication, revolving targets, etc.
                            Fridays are the practice days. </p>

                    <byline>(From Our Special Correspondent. )</byline>
                    <p>London, December 2.</p>
                    <p>The magnificent steamer "Heliopolis," of the Egyptian Mail Steamship Company,
                        com- menced her first voyage on November 28, when she left her moorings at
                        Greenock to proceed to Plymouth, en route for Marseilles. The strong
                        westerly yale of the previous day had moderated, and the ship started on her
                        tripdown the Firth of Clyde under the most favourable auspices. In addition
                        to the pas- sengers for Egypt who had selected to set out from Scotland,
                        there was a goodly number of experts in maritime matters, who proceeded as
                        far as Plymouth, in order to personally test and experience the sea-going
                        qualities of the ship. Among the large company on board were the Chairman,
                        Lord Armstrong, and Mr. Q. T. Symons, Managing Director of the Egyptian Mail
                        Steamship Company ; Mr. A. 8. Williams, manager of the Royal Mail Steam-
                        ship Company; Mr. J.8. Inglis, general ma- nager of the Great Western
                        Railway and others.</p>
                    <p>The. "Heliopolis" and her sister ship, the "Cairo," are both built by the
                        Fairfield Shipbuilding Company, of Glasgow, and are not only tur- bine
                        driven but propelled by triple screws, all working by turbine: mechanism,
                        the engine horse-power being 18,000 and the ship's ton- nage 12,000 gross.
                        The most noticeable feature with regard to this use of the turbine system is
                        the absence of vibration and the noise ine- vitably associated more or less
                        with the. old reciprocating-engine arrangements, and in this, as in every
                        other respect, the vessel must be pronounces a complete success. Although
                        dur ing aportion ofthe voyage a speed wasobtained of 22 knots, in most parts
                        of the ship the fact of her being in rapid motion was hardly perceptible,
                        and, indeed, the mental effect was so slight that the passengers wondered
                        whether the vessel had not temporarily ceased "going ahead."</p>
                    <p>Some particulars of the magnificent equip- ment of the "Heliopolis" -were
                        published by us on the occasion of the launch, but now that all the interior
                        arrangements and the elaborate decorations are complete, for which Mr. F. W
                        Collinson is responsible, a far better idea of her splendour and comfort can
                        be obtained. The idea which has been so successfully achiev- ed, was to
                        construct a vessel in which every- thing should be sithordinated to the
                        require- menta of passengers. Ibe considerations, there fore, as to the
                        conveyance of cargo have been kept in the back-ground.</p>
                    <p>Some idea of the dimensions of the "Helio- polis" may be formed when it is
                        explained that there are in all seven decks, apon five of which, at léast,
                        large state-rooms and numerous ele- gant saloons are arranged. Abaft the
                        officers quarters upon the upper deck is a café designed in Regency style in
                        panelled oak. Below this, upon what is termed the promenade deck, is the
                        Jarge deck-house, and in this, as also on the deck below, are a series of
                        magnificent saloons, only equalled by the reception rooms of a first-class
                        modern hotel.</p>
                    <p>The saloon upon the promenade deck is arranged as a 'insic room, and is 45
                        feet by 30, most charmingly furnished in Louis Quinze style, finighed in
                        white. Upon the bridge deck are the library decorated in Regence style, and
                        the smoking room, 50 feet, by 40 exeellently ventilated. Upon the stage
                        below is the magnifi- cent dining saloon, capable of seating some 260
                        persons at one time. Jt is fitted with tables of various sizes, to
                        accomodate both large and small parties of travellers. From personal
                        experience during the voyage, we can unhesita- tingly assert that the
                        cuisine could not be surpassed. The food is of the finest quality, and the
                        chefs employed are masters of the culinary art. As there are so. many stages
                        and decks, a lift has been provided for the convenience of passen- gers, and
                        everything that can conduce to their comfort in the way of electric
                        lighting, ventilating fans, eté. even including electric curling tongs, in
                        the cabins have been provided. Great care must have been exercised, arid
                        advice of responsible experts obtained, in the selection of the library, for
                        not only have the choicest works of modern fiction and travel been chosen,
                        but others of a more erudite character upon Egyptological subjects, besides
                        such books of history as may be said to possess an interna- tivnal
                        reputation, are generously provided. We cordially wish the Egyptian Mail.

                    <head>LORD CROMER'S SPEECH</head>
                    <p>"Fiscal" writes to "The Times" saying:-</p>
                    <p>You reported Lord Cromer as having stated that during the whole course of the
                        occupation the principles of free trade have been rigidly ap- plied in
                        Egypt."</p>
                    <p>May I ask him to explain how it is that in the Estimstes for 1907 £1,800,000
                        figures as revenue from customs—this sum being over 12 per cent. of the
                        entire estimated revenue and nearly 4 per cent. on the entire imports and
                        exports of merchandise</p>
                    <p>Is it not afact that there is a 1 percent. ad talorem duty on all exports
                        from Egypt and a 4 per cent. ad valorem daty on all im- ports into
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>I am, of course, familiar with the possible answer that these duties are
                        levied for revenue and not for protective, purposes; but I would snggest
                        that, while no one would advocate even a 4 per cent. ad valorem daty on all
                        im- ports into the United Kingdom, such a pro- posal might be defended on
                        exactly the same grounds and would, I am sure, be, notwith- standing,
                        vigorously denounced as rank protec- tion by all the gentlemen with whom
                        Lord Cromer associates himself.</p>
                    <p>Out of the 24 millions imports into Egypt I find that over three millions are
                        "cereals and vegetables." It would be interesting to know whether this duty
                        on food is 4 per cent or 8 Tobacco figures as an import for nearly,
                        £700,000. Has not the growing of tobacco been prohibited in Egypt, and is
                        this a rigid application of free-trade principles</p>

                        "Two years ago I had a most dangerous attack of influenza which left me a
                        martyr to rheumatism. Later on severe pains struck me across the kidneys,
                        stabbing pains that seized me at all times and which made it most difficult
                        for me to straight- en myself after stooping. My rest—that is to say, the
                        little I obtained-left me tired and exhausted in the mornings. The kidneys
                        acted badly, the secretions being disordered. My eyes were puffed up and I
                        had frequent attacks of dizziness, especially after stooping, when I used to
                        feel that I should fall if I did not catch hold of something to support me.
                        Pain in the region of the heart often troubled me. Then my ankles and feet
                        swelled at times, and altogether I was in a very bad condition.</p>
                    <p>"The doctor attended me, but his medicine did me little or no good. Last
                        April, however, I learned about Doan's Backache Kidney Pills and decided to
                        get some of them. I took them, but at first noticed no material improvement;
                        I bought a second box and then a third, and by this time there was no
                        mistaking the good they were doing me—the kidney secretions were free and
                        without pain, the pains in my back were gone, and I felt a different man in
                        every way. (Signed) P. CREEDON."</p>
                    <p>Just upon three years afterwards, Mr. Creedon wrote to say: "Since being
                        cured by Doan's Backache Kidney Pills I have never had a return of the old
                        complaint. I always recommended them in simple gratitude for the benefit I
                        derived from them."</p>
                    <p>Doan's Kidney Pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists at 18 P.T. per
