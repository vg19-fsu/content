                    <p>The eclipse was successfully observed here in a normal clear sky. The British
                        party, with invaluable assistance from Captain Lyons and the officers of the
                        Survey Department, obtained five ordinary exposures with an astrographic
                        telescope, besides one with a green colour screen and one enlargement, six
                        photographs polarized by reflection in a horizontal plane, and two in a
                        vertical plane. Mr. Gunther, of Magdalen College, Oxford, obtained six
                        plates with a Goerz lens for comparison with similar plates taken in
                        Lahrador.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reynolds's 120ft reflector was mounted under unforeseen difficulties, at
                        short notice, with the able assistance of Mr. Keeling, of the survey, who
                        has helped all the expeditions from the first. The local fire brigade kindly
                        flooded the ground under the tube to check radiation. All the photographs
                        will be developed shortly in Cairo in the Survey Department.</p>
                    <p>There was no opportunity to organise observations at the north and south
                        limits, or on the shadow bauds, but the Survey Department took six-hour
                        magnetic readings according to the international scheme and a register of
                        solar radiation.</p>
                    <p>The Lick Observatory party, under Professor Hussey, carried out their full
                        programme, obtaining eight plates with a 40ft. lens, eight plates for
                        intra-Mercurial planets with a composite battery of four telescopes, and one
                        plate of the general coronal spectrum. The Russian party took four plates of
                        the corona and a photographic register of magnetic elements.</p>
                    <p>The change of temperature was very slight, and a dead calm prevailed.</p>
                    <p>Tha corona was of the distinctly maximum type, with the longest streamer to
                        the southeast, about two diameters at most, probably less, and three others
                        shorter. Query, was the longest streamer over the recent sun spot. The
                        corona seemed small to the eye, perhaps owing to haze or dust and the low
                        sun. There was no sign of Mercury to the eye, nor was the moon seen at
                        sunrise here.</p>

                    <p>At about 6.30 p.m. yesterday a young European girl, who is believed to have
                        been a servant, threw herself into the sea opposite the "Cafe du Quai." The
                        waves carried the body to a point opposite the "Cafe Falerne" where it was
                        seen by a number of persons who had collected there. The coast guards had
                        already telephoned to the police of the Menchieh caracol, who for some time
                        did nothing, and, according to the official report could not recover the
                        corpse till about 11. p.m. Bye witnesses inform os that the body was
                        perfectly visible and might have been recovered with little difficulty, and
                        that the efforts made by the police on the spot were so feeble that it was
                        not till after 4 am. this morning that it was finally brought to shore.</p>
                    <p>The discrepancy between the statement made by the police and that of eye
                        witnesses is so great that we venture to call the attention of the
                        authorities to it If the corpse could have been recovered between 9 and 10
                        p.m.,as our informants asseverate, it would surely have shown better feeling
                        had the police risked a wetting. The idea that a dead body should be allowed
                        to drift about within a few yards of the shore for hours is so repugnant,
                        that we prefer to suppose that our informants did not take into account the
                        roughness of the water near the new quay. In any case the affair seems to
                        require further explanation.</p>

                        on this point between the members of the Railway Board, the matter will
                        remain in abeyance for the present It is, however, no indiscretion to state
                        that the return tickets will most probably be introduced with the new year,
                        but then only on the principal lines, such as Cairo and Alexandria, Cairo
                        and Port Said, and possibly also on the Suez line. Measures will be taken to
                        prevent the recurrence of the frauds that were formerly practised on the
                        railway administration, and that wore the cause of the abolition of return

                        centre will be for the second class passengers. They will be put on the
                        principal lines at as early a date as possible after the cars have had the
                        motors fitted at Boulao.</p>
                    <p>We gave a short time back a detailed list of the several extensions and new
                        lines the company are going to add to their present system. The first two to
                        be taken in hand will be the prolongation of the Khalig line from the
                        present terminus at Daher to the avenue Abbas, ending at the Gamrah bridge,
                        and the extension in the opposite direction of the same Line as far as the
                        abattoirs.</p>
                    <p>For the prolongation of the Boulao line from its present terminal point at
                        the landing stage of the Ghezireh Palace ferry to the railway workshops, it
                        will be necessary, in consequence of the narrowness of some of the streets
                        in that locality, to construct a river embankment which will be 150 metres
                        in length and 30 metres wide, which is estimated to cost £6,000.</p>
                    <p>According to the new concession granted by the Government these three
                        extensions will have to be ready for traffic in one year from the 23rd July
                        next</p>
                    <p>The company has paid the Ministry of Public Works the sum of' £3,500 towards
                        the expense of widening the road from Foum El Khalig to the point where the
                        new bridge to Rodah Island is being constructed,and £50,000 is the amount
                        agreed upon to be paid by the company for the privilege of crossing the
                        island from Old Cairo to Ghizeh when the new bridges</p>

                    <p>There was launched on the 31st August at Messrs. Harland and Wolff's Yard,
                        Belfast, the twin-screw steamer Herefordshire (a sister ship to the

                        Yorkshire disappear from this service, single screw boats being now
                        recognised as obsolete for first-class passenger traffic. The fortnightly
                        service of the Bibby line will therefore be conducted entirely with
                        twin-screw steamers of high power and the latest type.</p>
                    <p>Of oourse the Bibby patent tandem cabin is in fall evidence, for it has been
                        so generally appreciated that practically all the leading mail lines,

                        <dateline>Port Said, Wednesday.</dateline>
                        <p>From various sources I learn the following details of an accident which
                            occurred between kil. <measure>13</measure> and kil.
                                <measure>34</measure> daring last night. It appears that the S.S.
                            Chatham, having some <measure>70</measure> odd tons of dynamite on
                            board, which entered the Canal here early last evening, was' tying up to
                            permit the passage north of the S.S. Clan Camming. Before the manceuvre
                            was quite completed the Chan collided with her, and in so doing, it is
                            alleged, knocked down a lamp which was suspended in the Chatham's
                            forecastle. The whole of that part of the vessel was soon in flames, and
                            the proximity of such a large quantity of explosives decided; the crew
                            of the ship to at once leave her ; two or three have since arrived
                            here.</p>
                        <p>The chiefs of the Suez Canal Company, with characteristic energy, made
                            a11 preparations for what might easily prove to be one of the most
                            dreadful accidents on record The ex-plosion from whatever cause of such
                            an enor mous quantity of dynamite would, of course completely destroy
                            the canal for a great distance on either side, and the removal of debris
                            would have entailed the work of weeks in all likelihood. All the
                            powerful tuge and boats were at once sent down to the scene or the
                            disaster, and both M. Reynold and M. Schmidt, the chiefs at Ismailia end
                            Port Said, respectively, proceeded at a lata hour to the</p>
                        <p>All train service was suspended, and fresh water canal sluices were
                            closed in case an explosion should oocur, and both from north and south
                            ,Canal navigation was stopped. There are now some sixteen ships tied up
                            in the canal and several others at either end awaiting passage.</p>
                        <p>After going carefully into the matter it was finally decided to make a
                            dart at the ship with all the available pumps, with the idea of flooding
                            the hold in which the explosives Were stored,—the fact of the crew
                            having left the ship to herself making it more difficult.</p>
                        <p>The fire Was seen to diminish early this morning, but shortly after took
                            a fresh hold and as I write the full power of the pumps is being
                            employed to flood the ship.</p>

                    <p>The view taken by the Stock Exchange of the signing of the peace treaty
                        between Russia and Japan was naturally one of general satis-faction and
                        shares of all descriptions was immediately started, and a good deal of
                        excitement unsued during which prices steadily rose all around. Of the
                        stocks of the two belligerent nations, Russia seemed to forge ahead mors
                        than the Japs Now, after the first excitement is over, busi-ness seems to be
                        steadying down again, and in some quarters 'disappointment is expressed that
                        the rise did not continue. This, however, does not apply to the Russian and
                        Japanese stocks, the former of which have been bought in Paris, on the
                        belief that the Russian Fours trill before long be quoted at 100 again.
                        Japanese stock closes firm at 105 and the new loan at 95.</p>
                    <p>It is reported to-day that the arrangements are nearly completed in America
                        for the issue of a farther Russian loan, and in view of this, Russian
                        securities will be kept up. If the statement is correct that Japan will not
                        issue a new loan, we shall see a further steady and permanent rise in their
                        securities.</p>
                    <p>The markets close quiet and almost dull the effect of the Cronier failure
                        still being felt. Consols have not kept up to the highest and they close
                        to-day at 90. Other gilt-edged securities remain steady with a firm The
                        firming up of money is no doubt due in a certain measure to the fear that
                        the final financing of the war expenditure in the far East will tend to
                        affect the rates in Paris, Berlin, eta</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks and shares are still influenc-ed to some extent by the
                        Cronier fiasco, and even National and Agricultural fallen. We understand
                        that a meeting of the directors of the Societe das Sucreries d'Egypt was
                        held in Paris two days ago, at which the affairs of the Company were fully
                        discussed. No definite news as to what took place has yet transpired, but in
                        as much as the legal advisor of the Company in Egypt was present, it is
                        supposed that measures are being taken to strengthen the future position of
                        the concern. The action that it is said is about to be taken by the several
                        banks and bankers who discounted M. Cronier's bills and those drawn on the
                        Societe Sucraries d'Egypt and the Raffi-nerie Say may have very serious
                        these concerns, as they may be held res-ponsible for the signatures given by
                        their late director. Daira Sanieh stock finished today at and Daira Sugar 4

                    <p>Egyptian mines remain quiet with a slightly easier tendency, although Nile
                        Valleys have risen to over £l per share since our last, thus justifying our
                        remark that holders wotdBprohíba prohíba do well to average at the low price
                        which they touched last week. Um Rus are easy at 7/8 ; New Egyptians are
                        firm at 1 1/2, and Egyptian mines at 13.9. The recent rise in Nile Valleys
                        has been attributed to a belief that the company has successfully made
                        arrangements for the taking up of the 47,000 reserve shares that Mr.
                        Robinson refused under his option, but the "Financial Times" states to-day
                        that it is informed that no arrangement has yet been concluded as to the
                        placing of the balance the company's unissued shares, bet that shareholders
                        will at once be informed whenever anything definite is arrived at Neither
                        was anything known by the officials to confirm the various rumours in
                        circulation in the market as to favourable developments on the com-pany's
                        concession. </p>
