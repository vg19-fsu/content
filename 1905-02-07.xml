                                telegram, has caused a sensation in Germany. The papers are angrily
                                demanding an explanation. Some of them declare that Germany will now
                                Work with redoubled energy in order to increase her sea power.</p>
                            <p><persName>Mr. Lees</persName> now writes that he was incorrectly
                                reported, and that what he said was that we must assume all naval
                                powers to be possible enemies. Owing to the growth of. such naval
                                powers, our possible enemies are more numerous than hitherto, and,
                                consequently, we have to keep an anxious eye not only on the Medi-
                                terranean but also on the North Sea. The "Standard" learns from
                                Berlin that, unless <persName>Lord Lansdowne</persName> promptly

                    <p><persName>Lord Cromer's</persName> speech here yesterday has made a very good

                        Cromer's au- dience, were so impressed that they have told me that they
                        intend to petition the Govern- ment against the manner in which liquor shops
                        are being opened everywhere in the villages without let or hindance. I
                        intend to found a local society hero to combat the alcohofic habit among the
                        natives. </p>
                    <p>Lord and Lady Cromer and <persName>Lady Betrice Thynne</persName> paid a
                        visit to one of the native kuttabs hero which is under the care of the
                        Ministry of Public Instruction.</p>
                    <p>They also visited the native <persName>Sefa Coulop</persName> school. Della
                        Bey, French consular agent here, and the members of the schoof committee
                        recieved his lordship there. </p>

                    <p>A cairo correspondent writes:- to the west of Abdeen-square is a nasty
                        quarter where few sanitary and moral laws are enforced and where the
                        grossest criminality prevails. While in that locality today I learned that
                        in a quarrel between an armenian and three natives the armenian was so badly
                        beaten that he, after a week or more, died, and nothing has been done to
                        assailate or murderers. In fact, the principal was pointed out to me, and i
                        was informed that a seargant of police was bribed to strike this mans name
                        off the book for they all were arrested at the time of the quarrel. I wish
                        this matter to be inquired into, for it is a most gross outrage if it is
                        true as i am led to believe it is.</p>

                    <p><persName>Professor Felix's</persName> concert took place at the Khedivial
                        Hotel on Saturday night as an- nounced, and considering the wet and tem-
                        pestous weather, was well attended. We must congratulate the professor on
                        his courage in fixing a more modest price for the tickets than is customary
                        here for local artists, who ex- pect their kind friends to pay the same
                        price for the pleasure of bearing them perform as they would do for
                        distinguished artistes from Europe who can command audiences without the
                        disagreeable touting system in vogue in this country. Mr. Felix's selection
                        of piece was as it ought to have been, a happy one, as his silvery touch was
                        shown off to perfection in most of them. If there was one piece more than
                        another that elicited enthusiastic applause we might pick out an exquisite
                        Nocturne of Chopin's (Opus 15 No. 2), in which an oft-recurring melody
                        framed in flow mg cadenzas brought ont the pianist's remark able agility of
                        finger. Wagner's "Choeur des Fileuses" from his "Vaissean Fantome" arranged
                        by Lizt, was also much appreciated. Mr. Felix's wonderfully delicate touch
                        is not so well suited to the heavier German music, which requires greater
                        breadth of tone and a deeper sentiment. To our mind his conception of
                        Mendelssohn's "Fruhlings Lied" was quite incorrect and far removed from the
                        traditional one as taught in German Conaervatories,but on the other hand,
                        the Duo by the same com- poser was faultlessly played. </p>
                    <p>Professor Felix was ably supported by Mrs. Frederick Cree, who sang, first, a
                        romance by Giordano from Andrea Chenier with great refinement, and in the
                        socond part Beetho- ven's famous "Per Pieta." Her passionate rendering of
                        the presto, "Ah crudel I" quite carried away her audience, and on being
                        encored she repeated it with even more verve than the first time. We must
                        not omit the lovely little duet by Missa, "Les Roseaux Chanteurs,"
                        charmingly suug by Mrs. Cree and Mme. Felix, nor the instrumental trio
                        performed very ably by Mr. H. and Mr. L. Suzan accom panied by Mr. Felix.
                        Altogether a very plea- sant concert, but we must suggest that another time
                        the pauses between the items should be curtailed, and that a performer does
                        not ussually retire from the platform between two pieces bracketed a and b.

                        <p>H. M. S. ''Sealark'' arrived here from Sheikh Barghont on the 14th inst
                            in a damaged ion- dition, having struck a rock about 4 miles off Sheikh
                            Barghout whilst surveying. She had to come into Suakin for the necessery
                            repairs, which have now been carried, out with the aid of divers and
                            material obtained from the Sudan Government Railways </p>
                        <p>The "Sealark" after surveying here and at Sheikh Barghout, will probably
                            go into dock and then continue her survey as far as Australia, which is
                            her final destination. </p>
                        <p>The British S.S. "Dart" arrived from Eng- land on the 14th inst. with a
                            very largo con- signment of rails and fishplates for the Suakin- Atbara

                        not having been allotted shares, can start as many companies for general

                        <p>The Khedlvial Opera House reasserted itself in La Totea. The performance
                            was in every way excellent. <persName>Signora Pandolfini</persName>
                            obtained and justified the welcome due to an old Cairo favorite both by
                            her singing and by her acting. <persName>Signor Girand</persName> was
                            pleasing and artistic, and Signor Polese was conspicuous for the
                            excellence of his acting; we could wish: that all opera singers would
                            give as much attention to details. "II Sagrestano" was amusing ; and we
                            should like to hear more of Sig- nor Sala, the "timbre" of whose voice
                            has some charm. Staging and choris were alike all that could be desired.
                            We trust that other performances will maintain this level, and do away
                            with the undoubtedly bad impression caused by Rigoletto (amongst Other
                            pieces given). We would say one word as to the orchestra. Though, it is
                            certainly composed of good musicians and directed by an efficient
                            conductor, there is often apparent a certain want of judgment, which
                            might well be remedied, a lack of complete harmony with the singers,
                            This, in light opera, where the melodies for the chief performers are
                            the most prominent part, may not be so harmful in effect: but it is
                            fatal in any such opera as Tristan, or indeed in any piece where the
                            composer has devoted his attention to the music and not only to these

                        <p><persName>Signora Isabella Sricher</persName>, the celebrated operatic
                            artiste, who created such a furore at the Verdi Theatre in Cairo, and
                            whose advent bad been anxiously awaited by a large section of the
                            music-loving public, made her debut at the Abbas helmy Theatre on
                            Satdrday Evening in Lucia di Lammermoor, and her magni- ficent
                            performance reached to the full the highest expectations which had been
                            formed regarding her. To say that Signora Svicher was admirable or
                            excellent, would be but to very mildly express the quality of her per
                            formapoe, from every point of view. Indeed, we venture to say that never
                            has Egypt before been honored by the presence of two such magnificent
                            artistes as Signs. Gemma Bellin- cioni and Sigus. Isabella Sricher, and
                            from the rapturous applause so lavishly bestowed by enthusiastic and
                            delighted audiences on each of these accomplished ladies, it is certain
                            that the season will be a successful one. Signa. Svicher's Lucia, on
                            Saturday, was an inter- pretation such as is seldom seen. Her singing
                            was certainly a revelation to many present, and herr acting was of a
                            high order and showed careful study of this mobt difficult rfllo. The
                            tenor, Signor Tomiaaui being unwell, the role of Sir Edgard was
                            sustained by Signor Pagani, who scored a distinct success. In fact, we
                            think we have never heard Signor Pagani to better advantage. Signor
                            Baldelli, in the small part of Raimondo, was excellent. The other minor
                            parts were in good hands and the orchestra and chorus were fully up to
                            their usual standard.</p>

                        <p>An admirable performance of Giordano's Andrea Chenier was given on Sunday
                            night. <persName>Signor Pagani</persName> was in splendid voice and gave
                            an excellent interpretation of the exceedingly trying title role. He was
                            the success of the evening. <persName>Signora D. Bassich</persName>, who
                            made her debut on this oocasion, gave a fairly good rendering of the
                            part of Maddalens di.'Coigny, but her voice is not robust enough to
                            stand her in good steed in an opera like Andrea Chenier. As Carlo
                            Gerard, the baritone Badini, who possesses a voice of delightful
                            freshness, was eminently successful. <persName>Sig. Montanari</persName>
                            also scored a distinct success.</p>

                        <head>RIGOLETTO</head>
                        <p>Last night, a very excellent performance of Rigoletto was given at the
                            Abhas Theatre. Excellent, we say, because in every respect the
                            "ensemble" was a matter for admiration and, at times, even for Surprise.
                            In Rigoletto Verdi began to realise in a way which he hitherto had not
                            surmised, the important and extensive powers of his mind Up to this
                            point he had written many tunes which had been hummed and sung
                            throughout the whole world, but here he seemed to forego the enormous
                            spirit of tune that was within him, and to give himself up entirely to
                            the dramatic matter in hand. Last night's per formance of the opera was
                            eminently successful. Signora Svicher, in the part of Gilda, was from
                            every point of view a very great success ; her voice, which possesses
                            some of the most exquisite qualities of modern vocalisation, was proved
                            on this oocasion to possess an exquisite and, if one may use the
                            adjective in connection with singing, a shining quality that impressed
                            one enormously, by reason of the absolute purity of its evocation. Her
                            range is enormous; she never misses her effects, and, to sum up, we
                            regard her in no other light than that she is dazzlingly brilliant She
                            was frantically applauded, especially after her delightful rendering of
                            "Caro noms," which she was obliged to repeat Sig. Tomisani took the part
                            of the Duke and enchanted everybody by the magnificence of his singing.
                            He is a tenor of great power, and was in good form last night,
                            enthusiasm on the part of the audience following everything he did. It
                            stands to reason therefore that his rendering of "La Donna e mobile" waa
                            triumphantly successful. In the part of Rigoletto Signor Badini sang
                            excellently, though he did not impress us very much with his acting. The
                            other parts were in good hands. The chorus was at times disappointing,
                            but on the whole good, while the orchestra deserves credit. Tomorrow
                            night, Signore Ballincioni will appear in Fedora</p>

                    <p>Hier matin le Tribunal Mixte de Commerce d'Alexandrie, présidé par M. B. de,
                        Zoltan, a renda son jugement dans l'instance en concurrence déloyale intenté
                        par les principaux brasseurs de Munich &amp; la Crown Brewery de l'I
                        brahimish. </p>
                    <p>La Tribunal, adoptant les motifs exposés par F. W. Simond qui plaidait pour
                        la Crowa Brewery, a débonté les brasseurs de Munich de leur demande comme
                        mal fondée. </p>
                    <p>Les brasseurs de Munich avaient soutenu par l'organe de leur avocat, M. F. de
                        Duinreicher, qu'ils étaient en droit d'interdire à la Crown Brewery, de se
                        servir des dénominations: Bière de Munich et Bayrisch Beer.</p>
                    <p>Le Tribunal a retenu que quant à la pre. mière génomination, telle qu'elle
                        était employée par la Crown Brewery, soit : Superior Munich Quality, alle
                        oxolaait toute idée de provenance, mais désignait simplement une bière
                        resseinblant à celle de Munich, brassée et fabriquée comme celle brassée et
                        fabriquée à Munich. </p>
                    <p>Que d'ailleurs la Crown Brewery avait offert par exploit d'huissier de
                        remplacer la dénomii. nation de Superior Munich quality par toute autre au
                        gré des demandeurs et notamment par celle de : Simili Munich, genre de
                        Munich. </p>
                    <p>Qu'au surplus l'étiquette employée par la Crown Brewery ne laissait aucun
                        doute et ne pouvait, telle qu'elle était libellée, induire le consommateur
                        en erreur. Que les mots Crown Brewery s'y détachant à première vue, et
                        l'inscription y contenue : Brassée et embouteillée à la brasserie de
                        l'Ibrahimieh était amplemeut suffisante pour écarter toute idée de concur.
                        rence déloyale. </p>
