                    <p>It is worth noting at a moment when there is some talk about the necessity of
                        only granting decorations and grades in Egypt for merit, that King Edward is
                        starting a similar movement in England. "The information which we have had
                        placed at our disposal," says 'The Throne" of the24thalto.,"enables us to
                        state with authority that His Majesty views with extreme disfavour the
                        flagrant manner in which titles have been exploited for party purposes in
                        recent years, and will discountenance most strongly any promotions in the
                        future which are based upon mere liberal contributions to the party funds
                        Titles which ought to be conferred only upon men of high distinction in the
                        realm of intellectual activity have been knocked down to the highest bidder,
                        and these facts have not been disclosed when the name of the prospective
                        peer has been placed before His Majesty for approval. Sir William Jones, in
                        his famous ode in imitation of Alcseus, has given us a magnificent ideal of
                        the State. He reminded us, in words of singular force and beauty, that it
                        does not consist of 'starr'd and spangled courts, where low-bred baseness
                        wafts perfume to pride,' but of high-minded men, 'men who their duties know,
                        but know their rights, snd, knowing, dare maintain.' If England as a nation
                        is to realise that ideal, the honours which she has to confer upon her
                        distinguished sons must not be bought and sold in the political
                        market-place, but should be preserved as a priceless reward for those whose
                        lofty character and intellectual equipment fit them to become the
                        forerunners of a race of statesmen."</p>

                    <head>P. AND O. REPORT</head>
                    <p>This great company manages to pay 13 per cent. on its Deferred stock with
                        wonderful regularity, and it is fortunate not only in having different
                        sources of revenue, to that where one may fail another makes good the
                        deficiency, but also in having a thoroughly business-like board of
                        directors. It will come as no surprise to stockholders that the freight
                        returns for the year ended September 30 do not compare favourably with those
                        of the previous year, though the apparent deficiency is only £67,475 on a
                        total receipt of £1,521,309, and of this £31,600 is set down to less
                        Government work and lower rates, but the deficiency would have been greater
                        had it not been for the earnings of certain extra voyages. Outward Indian
                        trade was demoralised by a conflict between the English and German lines
                        engaged in the Antwerp branch of this trade, while homeward freights from
                        Indian ports were considerably below the normal point, and cargo was often
                        exceptionally scarce. In Australia freights also suffered in consequence of
                        a fall of nearly 50 per cent in the carrying rates for refrigerated produce,
                        and the cargo fleet engaged in the local trade between India, China, and
                        Japan was not so fully employed as in the previous year. The passenger
                        season, however, was a good one, the total traffic of £1,087,407 being an
                        improvement of £102,719 on last year, but the expense of working the new
                        vessels engaged in this service, which are much larger than the ships
                        replaced, and the further disbursements arising from the extra voyages,
                        materially swelled the expenditure, which, apart from the sinking fund,
                        shows an excess in the cost of navigating the fleet of upwards of £100,000,
                        a considerable proportion of which is attributable to the acceleration of
                        the mail service. The net result of the year's operations is really, very
                        satisfactory, for after setting aside for depreciation £461,097 to sinking
                        fund,the board is enabled to recommend une dividend and bonus as last
                        year.</p>

                            for the season, while entering on its fourteenth year. Last week's issue
                            (the second this season) is if anything an improvement on the first, and
                            both are full of interest to the resident and tourist alike. The journal
                            has the same features as last year—society gossip in Cairo and London,
                            chit-chat interesting personalis, visitors' lists, "Fashions of the

                            author, humorous tit-bits, and well-selected articles, besides a number
                            of illustrations, etc. The addition of a new printing department
                            equipped with the most modern machinery and the latest type has enabled
                            the publishers to bring out a handsome publication, which does credit to

                        <p>The smoking concert given at the British Club on Saturday was a great
                            success in every way, and it is to be hoped will prove to be only the
                            first of a series of similar entertainments. Mr. Heaton opened with a
                            pianoforte solo, and ably served as so accompanist throughout. Mr.
                            Parvis was in good form in the two solos he gave, especially in the
                            favorite "Veteran's Song." He also joined Mr. Sarjeant in a fine
                            rendering of a very telling duet, "Watchman, what of the Night!"
                            composed by Mr. Sarjeant's brother. Mr. De Rougemont delighted every one
                            with his whistling, which beautifully true, and also sang a couple of
                            songs. Mr. Pearce Hill, always a favourite, brought his dolls and
                            managed to check their hilarity though not that of the audience. Mr.
                            Dodwell is a master hand at entertaining, and kept all in roars of
                            laughter throughout his sketches and songs. M.D'Ambra gave four
                            selections on the violin with charming effect and exquisite touch. The
                            chair was taken at first by Sir Massie Blomfield, but owing to the
                            serious illness of Lady Blomfield he had to leave at the interval, and
                            Mr. Gould presided for the rest of the evening. Votes of thanks were
                            pasted to the chairman, and to Mr. Sarjeant for arranging the concert.
                            At the close the prizes won in the billiard handicap were presented by
                            Mr. Gould to the winners, Messrs. Legge, Wood and Sampson.</p>

                        burglars and a considerable amount of old silver plate removed. The police
                        have the affair in hand and are making in-vestigations which it is hoped,
                        will lead to the discovery of the criminals.</p>
                    <p>Burglary on an extensive scale has hitherto been of rare occurrence in Egypt,
                        but now that the large increase of the suburbs at Cairo and Alexandria
                        offers considerable opportunities to individual or to gangs of thieves it
                        behoves householders to be on their guard. </p>

                    <head>AT HOME" ON THE NILE.</head>
                    <p>The Hamburg and Anglo-American Nile Company gave a very pleasant "At Home" on
                        board their dahabeah Nubia yesterday afternoon. This fine boat was moored to
                        the land-ing-stage close to Kaar-el-Nil, and was in gala attire, palms and
                        flowers being in profusion and every comfort provided for the guests.
                        Asump-tuous tea was provided in the dainty saloon, which was set out with
                        little tables, while less innocent drinks were served from the smoking-room
                        on the upper desk. The Nubia is one of the finest of this company's
                        steamers, and her accommodation offers every comfort. The roomy cabins have
                        large and airy windows ; and every window is fitted with mosquito blinds,
                        and the cabins all contain ample shelves and chests of drawers and Other
                        conveniences not often met with on board any boat. The upper deck is glazed
                        in at the bows so that no untoward breeze may interfere with the comfort of
                        the passengers ; and everything has been done to ensure the arrangements
                        being as perfect as possible. A continuous stream of people took advantage
                        of the company's invitation to inspect the vessel; and though some of the
                        guests came expecting an afternoon cruise on the river there were few who
                        were not satisfied with the entertainment offered them.</p>

                    <head>REAL ESTATE AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writer Five months ago La Societe d'Entreprises
                        Immobilieres et de Travanx,. Cairo, made arrangements to take over 10%
                        (80,000 pips) of the land owned by La Societe Civile des Terrains Cleopatre
                        of Alexandria. This land has a superficial area of about .300.000 pies, and
                        is situated at Ibrahimieh (Alexandria) on the sea front. They bought the
                        land in Jane last from Messrs. Stagni and Zervudachi for P.T. 101 per pic.
                        The Municipality has now decided to extend the Alexandria promenade quay as
                        far as Sidi Gaber, which work will necessitate catting through the whole
                        length of the Cleopatre possessions. The necessary funds for carrying out
                        this work have already been voted by the Municipality. One can see at a
                        glance that the value of this property has already been considerably
                        enhanced, and it is estimated that there will be no difficulty in obtaining
                        P.T. 200 to P.T. 230 per pic for this land. At the present moment there are
                        firm offers on hand lor certain parcels at P.T. l60 per pic. which
                        represents a net profit of P.T. 69 per pic on purchase price. If the Societe
                        d'Entreprises Immobilidres et de Travanx ware to realize to day their
                        portion of the property, the sale would net them a clear £18 000, and this
                        on an expendi-ture of £7,500 made last June. As no doubt the property will
                        be disposed of at a more advantageous figure, a considerably larger profit
                        will result therefrom.</p>

                    <p>"Autres temps, autres mceurs"; old de Riverolles tale of the Middle Ages
                        seems now hardly more antiquated than Dumas 20 year-old play itself. By so
                        much have we progressed or—become blaze. And, paradoxically, "plus ca change
                        plus c'est la meme chose; there is the usual triangle, this time an
                        isosceles one, its sides composed of suspicions of husband and wife married
                        "a outrance" on a very weak basis of infidelity, and the denonement no less
                        laborious than the Pons Asinorum. We hardly care to think how a Dumas of
                        to-day would fare with a piece whose meagre plot and interminable dialogues
                        are equalled only by its want of plausibility and action. The constant
                        repetition of the main theme by nearly every character soon becomes tedious.
                        There is hero and there a redeeming epigram, but on the whole the play
                        offers little opportunity, nor did we think that, when produced on Saturday,
                        that little was pushed to its uttermost possibility. Even Mile Marthe
                        Brandes in the title idle did not mark her debut in Alexandria with anything
                        beyond an averagely good performance. For this, no doubt a severe cold, from
                        which she was suffering, was in a measure responsible. And then the part is
                        wordy and refitted and hence deprives its interpreter of a good deal of the
                        effect to be gained by appeals to the imagination. It may well be that a
                        stage idea of the 'femme du monde' is to keep the emotions genteelly in
                        check; still there was surely room for rather more colour and "abandon'' in
                        "Francillon" than Mile Brandis imparted. Setting aside M Arnaud, the present
                        troupe is certainly better than Mme Hading's com-pany, in that they shew
                        confidence and pull well together. On Saturday no one player stood out from
                        amongst the others, so it would be invidious to draw distinctions. This

                    <p>Topped by the mosque and ifs minarets, the Citadel stands clear against the
                        sky: the blood , red standard scarce flatters in the morning breeze, and the
                        ramparts are fringed will an evergrowing line of figures, clad in every
                        abade of ooloar but mostly capped with crimson tarboosh. The crowd in the
                        place below grows denser every moment as the morning mists roll away and
                        carriage after carriage flits its way into the enclosure. For civilized and
                        Europeanized as is our Cairo, this great festival, centred round the
                        departure of the Holy Carpet for Mecca, is still one of the great events of
                        the calendar and is eagerly awaited by both Mohamedan and Christian. The
                        night before its departure the heavily embroidered panels and the sacred
                        Mahmal were 'en evidence'. under cover, and great was the crowd that circled
                        round it and joined the audience in the adjoining tent where Dervishes
                        chanted their endless verses, and devotees persisted in their devotions till
                        the onlookers grew weary of the drowsy monotony and strange barbaric musical
                        intervals. But the morning ceremony held under the blue canopy of heaven and
                        with accompaniment of military display appeals more to the ordinary observer
                        and bolds attention from first to last. The native crowd, so full of colour
                        and movement, the mounted police reducing chaos into semblance ,of order,
                        the stretch of sand-covered road winding round the Citadel and up the slope
                        beyond, the wide parade ground lined with rigid troops, and the constant
                        stream of carriages and people, keep eyes and senses always on the alert.
                        High officials, gorgeous in their gold-laced uniforms, with brightly
                        coloured orders and glittering decorations, whirl by; and also many native
                        notabilities in wonderful eastern garb and flowing garments of various hues
                        with embroideries of gold about their necks and encircling their turbans.
                        Some drive in state behind proudly stepping horses; others arrive in humble
                        arabeshs, the effect made grotesque at times by the figure of a ragged
                        urchin taking a free ride behind. Closed broughams flash by containing
                        visions of veiled ladies of state, and the latest arrivals from England in
                        the latest thing in motor cars presses largely to the fore. But all are
                        ready in their places, and all the soldiers spick and span and well to
                        attention before the clatter of the Lancer escort proclaims the arrival of
                        H.H. the Khedive and his entourage in the highly swung barouche with syces
                        and outriders. The strains of the National Anthem, Royal salutes, and shouts
                        from the male population greet his arrival, while the curious twittering
                        cries from the native women add an element most curious and unusual to the
                        sound. In the meanwhile the Kiewet el-Mahmal has been borne into the centre
                        of the ground : the ' gorgeous tent-like creation has been already lifted
                        into position upon the honoured camel, all richly caparisoned and almost
                        covered with its saddle cloth and headpiece of gold and crimson. The Mahmal
                        itself is so overladen with heavy gold and silver bullion that scarce any of
                        its crimson ground is visible. High silver ornaments are at its angles, its
                        silver apex gleams from under a falling fringe of black. Swaying to the
                        movement of the camel it scintillates and blazons in the sunshine and moves
                        slowly across the ground past the Khedive, and starts the first stage of its
                        long and weary journey followed by the plaintive music of flats and native
                        drum. Stretched on long domed frames of wood, and looking for all the world
                        like enormous ambulance litters, follow the various portions of the sacred
                        carpet. They are carried on the stalwart shoulders of duffel clad gaffirs;
                        and while some are covered, all with black, others display their glittering
                        , inscriptions from the Koran upon a ground of black or green. After them
                        stream the various regiments : first the Lancers with their band playing,
                        somewhat inappropriately,very English music, then the guns of the field
                        battery and the mule battery, and after them detachments of the Egyptian
                        line. After the long stream has passed away out of sight and the final
                        salute is over, the Khe-dive drives off in his state carriage across the
                        ground, and the great function is over. Within half an hour the crowd has
                        drifted back to its highways and byeways, and the Citadel is once more left
                        to keep solitary watch and ward over the town at its feet.</p>

                    <p>SATURDAY'S DISPLAY.</p>
                    <p>As a demonstration of technical ingenuity, combined with simplicity of
                        manoeuvre, the display of the Alexandria Fire Brigade, held on Saturday
                        afternoon, at Moharem Bey, under the direction of Miralai Hockinson,
                        deserved the highest praise. But more than this. The feature that stood
                        forth most conspicuously, at that exhibition,was neither the excellency of
                        the equipment, nor the superior make of the machinery ; it was rather, if
                        the writer's allegory may be permitted, (he high standard of efficiency of
                        the "human machine"— effi cient in every detail of the manifold duties
                        involved in the fireman's risky work. The raw, untutored, undisciplined Arab
                        or Fellah has been taken in hand, and by the devotion of British and
                        European instructors, formed into a handy, able-bodied man. The. engine may
                        be perfect, hot it is after all the man behind it that tells. The brigade
                        whom Superintendent Waller marshalled on Saturday before his Excellency the
                        Governor and a goodly gathering of local portabilities—official and
                        civilian- were as fine a body of men as one could wish to see ; splendid
                        physique, and for all their swarthy faces, very imposing in their dazzling
                        brass helme's. There were a promptitude to obey and enthusiasm in action
                        which augur well, and it was also not a little gratifying to note the keen
                        delight shown by the native population, a huge concourse of whom covered the
                        steep slope of Kom el Dik; they were especially jubilant over the operations
                        for rescuing one of their own kith and kin,who his bare and puny legs
                        swinging in the wind, was let down from the top storey window. The display
                        commenced with inspection parade of brigade and equipment, consisting of
                        three fire engines, one automobile; a manual engine ; pompier ladder; long
                        ladder; and hose reel. To avoid tediousness, we will con-fine ourselves to a
                        generalisation of the several , items of the programme. The drilling was ,
                        perfect, and the record of time in which the work was carried out,
                        remarkable. For instance the manual engine was got in'o action, pump pipe,
                        and all, by one man within 1.41 minutes. The pompier ladder, whose uses were
                        next demonstrated, is, we believe, a French invention ; the books at the end
                        of the short ladders employed in climbing from storey to storey reminded one
                        of the fore feet of that interesting invertebrate, the Walking Stick insect
                        Reaching the top of one ladder, the fireman secured himself by a catch to
                        the sill, while he fixed on the ladder he carried to the upper floor; the
                        rungs were attached to a centre—piece like fish- bones to the spine, and the
                        saw—like appearance made one shudder. The rope used in the escape is of
                        coreless multiple strand called "Simonis," of London make, very light and
                        thin, but of immense strength. We had also a practical demonstration of the
                        water curtain, which so ingeniously protects the fireman by a circular spray
                        at right angles to the jet The chemical cylinder, containing carbonic acid
                        gas, that rapidly extinguished a fierce fire, and the smoke helmet, were
                        also interesting. The long ladder is eighty feet in length. At full span, it
                        looks top heavy, but except for an initial list, the carriage on which it
                        stands scarcely creaked, no matter what way the ladder was turned. It is of
                        German manu- factors, built by Honig of Cologne, and not the latest thing in
                        ladders, for by the newest invention the fireman is winched up by a motor
                        engine. But for Alexandria, which at present is free of sky scraping
                        architecture, the German apparatus will suffice. The motor fire engine was,
                        as with the others, constructed by the well known firm of Merryweather of
                        London ; it was converted to automobility recently by an expert sent from
                        London, Under 120 pounds pressure, or 12 H P., it can run 16| miles an bour.
                        A word for the horses of the other engines. They are nearly all South of
                        England breed ; they are thoroughly trained and powerful drays, which, for
                        all the sandy roil, drew op instantaneously, even at full gallop. The "house
                        on fire" scene was the grande finale, most realistic with just a suspicion
                        of smoke —the spectators would have bean delighted with a good old blaze but
                        proximity to the station buildings forbade ; or perhaps the house was too
                        wet After the gallop past the parade reformed, and his Excellency the
                        Governor congratulated Superintendent Waller and his men on their admirable
                        performance.</p>

                        concerned. The allotment letters and cheques will be sent out to applicants
                        certainly not later than the end of the present week. The United Egyptian
                        Lands, Limited, has secured an option, in addition to the 55,000 metres
                        referred to in the prospectus, on land on Rodah Island. This brings up the
                        total to over 220 000 square metres and works out at under £2.l0s. per
                        metre, including all charges. The land is excellently situated with a
                        frontage on the Nile. The Garden City plots are fetching from £5 to £14 per
                        metre and the land immediately opposite at Gbizeh from £4 to £6, so the
                        option obtained by the United lands must be considered exceptionally
                        favourable.</p>

                    <p>"Feast" opened well enough. We had three new people. M Massas Mephistopheles,
                        Mile Baron as Margoerite, and M. M&lt;hy as Valentine. If the whole
                        performance had not tailed off so wretchedly we should have appreciated
                        them. Mile Baron can act; and it is the greatest possible relief to see a
                        Marguerite who has any notion of acting. The "Thole" song was perhaps her
                        best achievement. The tremolo—wh'ch she uses far too much—came in as a
                        "roucoulement"—a real spinning-wheel song. crooned to herself. The Jewel
                        song would hare been even better, but she spoilt it by a "show" high note at
                        the end which dramatised her soliloqoy out of its proper form Her acting was
                        especially good in the church scene with Mephistopheles: many slight
                        touches, her concentration on the mass-book from which her thoughts were so
                        far absent, her painful progress across the stage kneeling— these and much
                        else proved her merit but her voice seems tired, and now and again she uses
                        that tremolo to avoid an awkward semitone or accidental. M. Maas was not
                        bad, but seemed to have bad quite enongh of the play long before the end. M.
                        Mezy has little enough to do, but his voice is good, with plenty of strength
                        and far more 'colour' than those of the others. M. Fontaine, I was told, had
                        been suffering from dengue. He must have had it from the beginning of the
                        season than ; he showed the same tendency to force his notes, especially in
                        the lower register, as he did in 'Manon' and "Romeo and Juliette." It is a
                        pity, as his higher, more emotional notes are the "real thing." But why does
                        he make up so badly! He always appears grotesque with that absurd beard and
                        moustache arrangement In "Manon," after the first two acts he was well made
                        up, and naturally; and it made all the difference in the world. Siebel (Mile
                        Karl) and Marthe (Mile Burizy) were fair. The chorus end orchestra were very
                        bad : the former were stiff, and at best noisy, and in the soldiers' chorus
                        they looked like a lot of gaffiers on parade. The latter, as I have already
                        said, seems to be always asleep and flat. The conductor has no sort of
                        entrain. He gets through it all anyhow and never makes a point of any sort.
                        No wonder the operas go badly! The famous Escalais appears at length in
                        'William Tell tomorrow (Saturday) night; so we shall see the company in its
                        more serious aspect. Let us hope for a vivid and striking contrast to the
                        first few efforts. It is, I think, no use people talking (as I have heard
                        and read lately) about the small Opera House, the difficulties, etc, etc. I
                        can't see any sort of excuse for the shortcomings. We need not expect Caruso
                        and Melba, but surely the receipts end whatever help the company get should
                        ensure at least a really good second-class troupe. Really, when one is
                        driven to indulgence in comparison with the Abbas and ci-devantt Verdi
                        Theatres, with any stage where any singing can be heard, one resents hearing
                        the Opera Home spoken of as the chief Khedivial Theatre, etc.. etc. No one
                        likes having dost thrown in his eyes!</p>
                    <p>'GUILLAUME TELL'</p>
                    <p>''Guillaume Tell" was a startling and wel-come change. M Escalais, Mezy.
                        Mass, and Mile Devilloy are all four, of a different class to any we have
                        yet heard : they are grand opera, and very good grand opera at that. M.
                        Escalais has a great resonant voice : his high notes are those of a clarion
                        shaking and echoing through the house; his diction and declamation are those
                        of a great singer. Of course his acting and, in a sense, some of his singing
                        are entirely stereotyped and traditional: be is, except for those high
                        notes, a type and not an individual He sang rather flat now and again in the
                        lower and middle registers and was inclined to skirt round the note ; and in
                        those same registers was a suspicion of wear and tear and effort His finest
                        singing was in the duet with Mathilde. the "J'expire" and the trio, and the
                        two songs in the last act, "Mes ami." and ''Asile muet" M. Mass was more at
                        home than as Mephistopheres, and the depth and "roundness" of his voice had
                        foull scope. M. Mezy though, was the triumph of the evening. His voice, a
                        great baritone, had every shade of strength and colour and drama : and his
                        acting was equally fine and not nearly so strewed as that of the rest. Mile
                        Deviloy had not half enough to do, from our point of view. She is, I really
                        think, the most perfect of the sopranos. She has far more tone than Mile
                        Baron, and though she has hardly the training of Mile Charpentier, her voice
                        is infinitely sweeter: never a disagreeable or harsh note, or a shadow of
                        fatigue or thinness, and her notes were sweetness itself. Those phases of
                        the opera I have mentioned, -and I add Mezy's singing and acting before
                        "Gessler"—were as near perfection as could be. As for the rest, the
                        orchestra did the overtore well, and kept to a fairly good standard most of
                        the time ; but in the trio— Walther, Arnold and Guillaume Tell—it was again
                        shaky and inaccurate. The players do not respond enough. Mile Karl acted
                        well all through, but her singing lacks certainty : she never seems sure of
                        herself or her voice. M. Durand looked like Henry VIII. in a most tyrannical
                        "get-up," and sang well enough. The others one may as well pass over. The
                        chorus must have a special condemnation. The breakdown in the 3rd act, the
                        general tuneless-ness and carelessness seem to show an entire lack of
                        drilling or training. I admit most of them seemed to know it, and to be
                        sorry for what was probably not their fault; but one or two of the worst
                        offenders (I think they were in last year's chorus) seemed hopelessly
                        satisfied with themselves and stared and sang into vacancy with the most
                        deplorable aplomb. Of ballets, I am no judge : opinions seemed to differ;
                        but certainly I am thankful in that the vision of fleshly poetry of motion
                        caused one worthy at least behind me to stop making horrible noises with
                        programme, feet, throat, and other accessories that were not meant by the
                        Creator as annoyances to one's fellow-creatures! At one moment I would have
                        given much for a powerful and wide-spreading narcotic for use in the
                        stalls.</p>

                    <p>DR. WILLIAM'S PINK PILLS.</p>
                    <p>Three people in one Linconlshire village-mother, daughter, and neighbour's
                        child— whose sufferings arose from a single cause, namely, weak and bad
                        blood, have found overtiming new strength and vitality in Dr. William's Pink
                        Pills for Pale People, the one remedy that could fill their veins with the
                        rich red blood of health.</p>
                    <p>"My mother was for years subject to fainting fits" said Miss Emma E. Booth,
                        when interviewed at Broadholms, Saxilby, Lincolnshire. "She would fall to
                        the floor like a stone under these terrible weakening attacks, and she
                        continued to suffer from this most obstinate farm of acute debility until my
                        father bought Dr. Williams Pink Pills for her. As my mother took the pills
                        she quickly realised they were the one thing needful to bring her back to
                        health, for the fainting fits left her, and as her blood became enriched, so
                        she regained strength until life and work became a pleasure again.</p>
                    <p>I, myself, have suffered from aneamia," Miss Booth continued, "since I was
                        fourteen. Gradually my health went from bad to worse until a crisis came.
                        Then I lost every atom of energy, becoming quite bloodless and weak. Severe
                        headaches, discomforting pains in the chest, and an irresistible languid
                        feeling made my days unbearable. I had terrifying dreams at night, which
                        caused me to grow dreadfully nervous, and slowly and surely I became thin,
                        pale and careworn. At times I felt as if I would drop down over my work
                        through sheer helplessness ; I had no appetite whatever and was always
                        breathless and subject to palpitations. No medicine did me any good ; in
                        fact, it would have bean a relief to lie down and die.</p>
                    <p>"Then my mother advised me to lose no time but taka Dr. Williams' Pink Pills;
                        for she said I needed new blood to make me well. So I took the pills and
                        very soon my appetite returned ; I began to gain strength ; my colour came
                        back and I put on flesh. Since taking five boxes of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        I have enjoyed the bast of health, and I eat, sleep, and work well now with
                        no traces at all of the many ills that follow in the train of anaemia.</p>
                    <p>"When our neighbour's little girl had an </p>
                    <p>attack of St. Vitus' Dance, twitching and jerking her limbs, with convulsive
                        movements of her features, my mother recommended these pills again, for poor
                        blood causes weak nerves, and in this third case we were delighted to find
                        that Dr. Williams' Pink Pills effected a complete cure."</p>
                    <p>For both sexes, and for many disorders apparently different in nature, Dr.
                        Williams Pink Pills are equally valuable ; the reason of this great success
                        is due to their wonderful power of reinforcing and enriching the blood. All
                        the diseases that arise from watery or vitiated blood have been cured by
                        these pills, including Anaemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Rheumatism, and Nervous
                        Disorders such as St. Vitus Dance, Sciatics, Neuralgia, Paraly-is ; also the
                        ailments that afflict Women only. Only the genuine pills, those labelled in
                        foil on every box Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, effect these
                        cures. Of all dealers, or in case of doubt send 2s. 9d for one box, or 13 9d
                        for six boxes to the British Depot 46, Holborn viaduct, London.</p>

                    <p>PROSPECTUS.</p>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes set out in its Memorandum of
                        Association, to carry on business in Egypt and the Sudan, and more
                        particularly to develop the well-known health resort of Helouan, near Cairo,
                        by the acquisition of Land and Building sites, and by the erection of
                        Buildings thereon, and generally with the object of acquiring interests of
                        divers kids in this rapidly improving district.</p>
                    <p>Although facilities for the acquisition of properties in Helouan will it is
                        believed be afforded the Directors, yet no existing or proposed contracts to
                        be entered into by the Co. on its inception are in force.</p>
                    <p>It is unnecessary to point out the paramount position held by Helouan as a
                        health and pleasure resort, as the fame of its curative mineral springs and
                        delightful climatic condi-tians are so well known and appreciated. But what
                        is interesting to know, from a commercial point of view, is that the rapid
                        growth of Helouan has attracted the attention of investors to the
                        opportunities that now offer for the remunerative employment of capital in
                        its development.</p>
                    <p>Helouan is situate about 16 miles from Cairo, and is connected by the
                        Egyptian Delta Light Railways, Limited, the directors of which are so alive
                        to the future of this rising suburb of Cairo, that they have or are about to
                        expend £60,000 in improving this branch of their line. The line to Tourah
                        was recently doubled, thus accelerating the communication and enabling the
                        Company to put on a frequent service of Express Trains, (the journey
                        occupying about 30 minute'). The passenger service has already been equipped
                        with luxurious modem corridor carriages fitted with Electric Light.</p>
                    <p>Helouan is becoming increasingly popular as a residential, district tor City
                        professional and business men, and a growing demand is apparent-for more
                        improved and commodious habitations than at present exist.</p>
                    <p>The yearly influx of visitors steadily continues, hotel and other residential
                        establishments are feeling the tax on their resources to adequately meet the
                        requirements of those seeking the health-giving advantages of Helouan's
                        desert air.</p>
                    <p>The Golf Links, Racecourse, Paddock, Racing Stables, etc., are important
                        attractions, and the surroundings afford the most enjoyable place for horse
                        exercise near Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The following is given in compliance with the requirements of the Companies
                        Act, 1900.</p>
                    <p>The provision in the Articles of Association as to the remuneration of the
                        Directors are as follows :—</p>
                    <p>" As remuneration for his services as a " Director the Chairman shall receive
                        " remuneration at the rate of £300 per ' annum, and the other Directors
                        shall " receive remuneration at the rate of £250 " per annum. In addition to
                        the said fixed " remuneration there shall be divided be " tween the
                        Directors, in such manner as ' they may determine, a sum equal to 10 " per
                        cent. on the profits certified by " auditors of the Company to have teen "
                        made in each year in excess of a sum " sufficient to provide a dividend of
                        six</p>
                    <p>" per cent upon the amount paid up or ' credited as paid up, on the Ordinary
                        " Shares for the time being, having re-" gard to the provisions as to the
                        division " of profits hereinbefore contained, but " without making any
                        provision for a " reserve fund. "</p>
                    <p>' The remuneration of a Managing Director " or a Director or Directors, as
                        managers " shall, from time to time, be fixed by the " Directors, and may he
                        by way of Salary " or commission, or participation in profits,</p>
                    <p>" or by any or all of these modes. "</p>
                    <p>" If any Director, being willing, shall he " called upon to perform extra
                        service, or " to make any special exertions in going " or residing abroad,
                        or otherwise for any " of 'he purposes of the Company, or act ' as trustee
                        for the Company or its De-" benture holders, and shall do so, the " Company
                        may remunerate such Director " either by a fixed sum or by a percentage " of
                        profits or otherwise as may be deter " mined by the Directors, and such "
                        pemuneration may he either in addition " to or in substitution for his
                        remunera-" tion above provided. "</p>
                    <p>By a contract dated 17th November, 1906, and made between Andrew Percy
                        Phillips on behalf of the Company and the Egyptian Lands and Agency,

                    <p>[ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS.]</p>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes set out in its Memorandum of
                        Associa-tion; and especially to carry on business in Egypt and the Soudan.
                        The attention of the Board will, as opportunities present themselves, be
                        more particularly- directed to</p>
                    <p>1. The purchase, development and sub-sequent leasing or re sale of
                        agricultural and building land.</p>
                    <p>2. The lending of money, on mortgage or otherwise on land or other approved
                        securities.</p>
                    <p>3. The carrying on of the business of an Investment Company.</p>
                    <p>The removal of all possibility of friction, due ' to the Anglo-French
                        Agreement, and the con-fidence engendered by the certainty of a pro-traded
                        British administration, has added the element of stability to Egypt which it
                        pre- viously lacked.</p>
                    <p>That this vital fact is being realised is clearly shown by the remarkable
                        progress now being made in agriculture and commerce, which again is
                        reflected in the ever-increas-ing prosperity of the natives and the steady
                        rise in value of all property. While the rise in land values during the last
                        few years has been remarkable, those who are best acquainted with the
                        conditions of the country end its people are emphatically of the opinion
                        that a further steady increase of prosperity and a corresponding improvement
                        in values is assured.</p>
                    <p>The increasing wealth of the natives, whose one form of investment is
                        agricultural land, coupled with the fact of their rapid numerical increase
                        and the natural limit imposed upon the cultivation of new land by the amount
                        of water available for irrigation, all tend to increase the capital and
                        rental values of such land as is either actually under cultivation or is
                        approaching that stage; in addition to which, there always remains the fact
                        that, even if the utmost possibilities foreshadowed by Sir William Garstin
                        as to water supply were fulfilled, it is estimated by Mr. Lang Anderson,
                        that at most about another one and a half million acres could be brought
                        into agricultural use in the whole of Egypt, and that, only alter an
                        expenditure of over ten millions sterling, during a period of twenty years.
                        At the end of 1904, roughly five and . a quarter million acres of land were
                        held by about one million owners, of whom nearly seven-eighths were native
                        holders of less than five acres each. With an estimated present population
                        of about eleven millions, which is steadily increasing at the rate of about
                        8 per</p>
                    <p>cent per annum, and with a revenue and a foreign trade which have increased
                        over 60 and 100 per cent. respectively during the last 25 years, it would
                        appear that the expression need in Lord Cromer's Report of March last that
                        "the material prosperity of the country rests on a basis of somewhat
                        exceptional solidity" is amply justified.</p>
                    <p>In view of the facts above stated this Com pany will mainly devote itself to
                        the development of selected agricultural estates with a view to their rental
                        or sale to natives in plots suitable to their requirements. Excellent
                        opportunities frequently occur of lending money on first mortgage at good
                        rates and with an ample margin. With a local Advisory Board composed of
                        business men of high standing and long experience in Egypt good profits may
                        reasonably be expected from this and other forms of investment which require
                        special local knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Hicks Pauli, the well-known Agricultural Expert in Egypt, has joined
                        the Advisory Board, and will act as the Company's technical adviser for a
                        period of three years.</p>
                    <p>The Company has acquired from The H. and J. Syndicate, Limited, the right to
                        purchase the Kom-EI-Akhdar estate of 4,793 feddans (say 5,000 English
                        sorts), situated about 50 miles south of Alexandria, and connected by a
                        tramway, 1 1/2 miles in length, with The Delta Light Railways system. Mr. R.
                        Laug Anderson has reported to The H. and J. Syndicate, Limited, upon the
                        property, and a copy Of his Report is sent herewith.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted. that he states that the supply of water appears to be
                        excellent, and the property well supplied with main canals. That the soil
                        varies from a very light sandy loam to a heavy black loam, but is all
                        suitable for cultivation of the usual crops of Lower Egypt That the
                        principal buildings are in excellent condition, and quite sufficient for the
                        property-at present, but more accommodation for tenants will have to be
                        built yearly as the land comes to the letting stage. That the number of
                        working bullocks is sufficient for reclamation purposes, and there is a good
                        supply of moles, houses and donkeys for transport work. The usual crops of
                        cotton, berseem, wheat and barley were doing well. That the property was
                        capable of great development at moderate cost, and if £30,000 were
                        judiciously spent on it during the next five years it could be brought to a
                        capital value of £75 to £80 per feddan. That the work of development is
                        simple and follows well known lines, so that the element of unforeseen
                        contingencies was largely diminished, while the results of develop-ment were
                        sure. That he advises the property is a good investment at £45 per feddan,
                        and confidently recommends the purchase. That if money on development is
                        well spent, the capital value will increase enormously yearly. That the
                        present rental received is L.E. 3,841 600 (=£3,940 sterling), that is £4 per
                        feddan in respect of 980 feddans let, and he states that in his opinion,
                        when fully reclaimed, the whole of the property should let at an even better
                        rent—4,793 feddans at, say, £1 101. per feddan, would give an income of
                        £21,500 per annum.</p>
                    <p>The H. and- J. Syndicate, Limited, have obtained an option on a valuable
                        property, of about 55,000 metres, at Rhode Island, Cairo, which can be
                        secured by this Company at a satisfactory price.</p>
                    <p>The Directors have other business in view Which is believed to be of a most
                        profitable nature ; as, however, negotiations are still in progress, it is
                        not possible to give details at present</p>

                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                    <p>KOM-EL-AHDAR PROPERTY.</p>
                    <p>Having visited the Kom-al Ahdar property,</p>
                    <p>I beg to report as follows: —</p>
                    <p>SITUATlON.— The property is well situated and easily got at, being about 50
                        miles southeast Alexandria and only 1 1/2 miles distant from Kom-al-Ahdar
                        Station on the Delta Light Railway, from which point there is a 60
                        centi-metre tramway to the principal homestead.</p>
                    <p>Irrigation —The supply of water appeared to be excellent, and the property is
                        well sup-plied with main canals.</p>
                    <p>Drainage on the greater part of the Estate is good, but the drains are too
                        few in number and not deep enough. The whole property would greatly benefit,
                        in my opinion, by a closer and deeper system of canalisation. About l,000
                        feddans, more or less, are comparatively low lying and many require to have
                        their drainage pumped during part of the year to reclaim them properly.</p>
                    <p>Soil varies from a very light sandy losm to a heavy black loam, but is all
                        suitable for cul-tivation of the usual crops of Lower Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Buildings.—The principal buildings, which are in excellent condition, are
                        quite sufficient for the property, but more accommodation for tenants will
                        have to be built yearly as the land come to the letting stage.</p>
                    <p>STOCK—The number of working bullocks is sufficient for reclamation purposes,
                        and there is a good supply of mules, horses, and donkeys for the transport
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Present Condition. - The usual crops of cotton, berseem, wheat, and barley
                        are doing well, end on the high light soil all round the principal dwelling
                        house, orange and lemon trees would grow well. On several parts of the
                        Estate the cotton was looking very well, but on other parts it was doing
                        badly, simply due, in my opinion, to having been planted on land not yet
                        sufficiently reclaimed to grow the crop. Rice was being grown as a
                        reclamation crop, and would be better it the drains were closer and deeper
                        and the land more carefully levelled before the crop was sown.</p>
                    <p>Future Development. The property is capable of great development at moderate
                        cost. 'If £30,000 is judiciously spent on it during the next three years, it
                        can be brought to a capital value of £75 to £80 per feddan. The work of
                        development is simple and follows well known lines, so that the element of
                        unforeseen contingencies is largely diminished, while the results of
                        development are sure.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion.—The property is a good invest-ment at £45 a feddan. The revenue
                        for the first year or two will he small, but if the money on development is
                        well spent the capital value will be increasing enormously yearly, and later
                        on the revenue will come in and go on increasing until at least £4 10ss is
                        reached. I can confidently recommend the purchase of this Estate of 4,793
                        feddans, which, according to Mr. Sursack's figures, has at present a rental </p>
                    <p>of L.E. 3,841,600. from an area of 980 feddan let, which is slightly over £4
                        sterling per feddan and I see no reason why the whole of the pro-perty when
                        fully reclaimed, should not do even better, as some of the let land is not,
                        in my opinion, quite ready to give to tenants, and if the proprietor had
                        kept it in his own hands for another year under reclamation crops he could
                        have got a higher rent.</p>

                        The land tax payable to Government varies from P.T. 5 to P.T. 57 per feddan,
                        and, according to Mr. Sursock's figures, amounts at present to L.E. 653.646

                        3/5 per feddan, but this, of course, will be increased as the land is

                    <head>BOURSE DU CAIRE</head>
                    <p>Les architectes qui se préparaient au con cours des projets pour un Palais de
                        la Bourse da Caire, ont été quetqae peu froissés da fait de la prolongation
                        arbitraire de la date de le consigne des travaux, prolongation accordés pour
                        permettre l'arrivée de projets de l'étranger. Le jury, appelé à décider sur
                        les projects exposés, ne doit pas oublier cette circonstance et, à mérite
                        égal, se prononcer en faveur de cenx qui étaient prêts an jour et à l'heure
                        fixés.</p>
                    <p>Il y a pea à choisir entre les treize projets exposés, oar la plupart de
                        leurs auteurs ont oublié de donner à l'édifice le caraotère monumental et
                        spéoial à ces sortes de construotions. Vous y voyez, par example, si l'on en
                        juge par l'aspeot extérieur, des théâtres, des villas, des maisons de
                        rapport, des magasins même, ce qui est bien loin do bat da conoonrs, destiné
                        à donner naissance, d'après le programme, à une œuvre d'art</p>
                    <p>Ceux qui répondent le mieux an but pour-suivi sont, a mon avis, les Nos. 1, 4
                        et 13, trois travaux de premier ordre et qui révèlent chez leurs antenrs une
                        compétence indiscutable.</p>
                    <p>Le No. 1 Art et Labeur, qui présente aussi une maquette en plastiline, se
                        recommande par une valeur artiitiqae exceptionnelle, une décoration
                        intérieure très riche et un ensemble très agréable. Le No. 4 Vox Populi,
                        conçu sur le même plan est an travail sans doute remarquable, mais la façade
                        d'entrée est d'une pauvreté qui jare avec tout le reste de l'é lifice. Le
                        No. 18 Nuccia est d'une richesse décorative admirable. Je ne discute pas ici
                        la distribution intérieure ; je me borne à faire observer que la salle de la
                        Corbeille do No. 4 se trouve par sa disposition même obligés à servir de
                        passage.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
