                    <p>There is nothing to be gained from the study of the unfortunate and bitter
                        controversy that has broken out afresh between Lord Curzon and the
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. The debate between the the great
                        viceroy and the great soldier had for its cause and subject views, honest ly
                        held and diametrically opposed, concerning the Government of the greatest of
                        the dependancies of the Empire. But whatever its matter, ita manner
                        degenerated sadly, and the public have now been invited to witness an
                        undignified altercation between two of the greatest living Englishmen. The
                        only thing gained by the publication of Lord Kitchener's recent
                        correspondence with the Viceroy and the latter's reply, is the absolute
                        certainly that no compromise which had the remotest chance of "working, "
                        could have been arranged. Whether the home public or India, or the other
                        great dependencies of the Empire, are the better for their knowledge is a
                        very open question. Lord Kitchener concludes his minute of the 38rd alt.

                        his orders, and have failed to accept those orders loyally where they
                        differed from my original proposals." The Viceroy, in a long reply, says
                        that Lord Kitchener's minute was published at his own request. Since Lord
                        Kitchener thought fit to publicly challenge Lord Curzon's statements, and
                        although Lord Curzon deprecates a controversy on technical points, and
                        though a summary condensed for the telegraph could not necessarily do fall
                        justice to every feature of the case, he (Lord Curzon) gladly welcomes the
                        chance of substantiating every statement made, and of proving the
                        correctness of the inferences he drew from them. The result is not edifying.
                        Lord Carzon's reputation for public spirit and for the diplomatic caution,
                        which his Parliamentary critics asserted that he carried to excess while
                        Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Lord Kitchener's
                        reputation as a strong man gifted with almost melodramatic self-command and
                        capacity for silence have suffered terribly from the publication of their
                        respective contributions to the controversy. Our public men seem to have
                        lost the gift of silence in cases where their amour-propre is involved. We
                        hope this may be the last of a series of indiscretions which began with
                        General Buller's speech.</p>

                    <head>PEACE.</head>
                    <p>The news received a few days ago from Tokio that the radical party in Japan
                        and the mass of the populace might yet bring the results of the Peace
                        Conference to naught, has happily not been confirmed by subsequent events
                        The Japanese cannot be expected to show the same satisfaction at the
                        material results of their success as they would have done had the whole
                        island of Saghalien fallen into their hands and had a large indemnity
                        recouped them for their expenses. But while the news of popular
                        dissatisfaction goes far to confirm the opinion of those who hold that at
                        present peoples are more warlike than kings or aristocracies, we imagine
                        that the extraordinary self control and patriotism which the Japanese people
                        have learnt from the military caste of the Samurai will prevent them from
                        showing their resentment too forcibly and that the joy that hundreds and
                        thousands of families will experience at the return of what may fairly be
                        called "the ever-victorious Army" will sweep away all feelings of wounded
                        pride or dissatis faction. After all Japan has gained enormously -in fact
                        her success has given her the certainty of a continued existence as a
                        nation. Three years ago Japan seemed destined to become Russia's vassal or
                        victim. To-day, she is the England of the East, and her emblem of the rising
                        san that commemorates the descent of her illustrious line of ralers from the
                        Dawn Goddess is a fair omen of future success.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand no one will grudge M. de Witte his triumph. Unaccustomed to
                        diplomacy, speaking English not at all and French but poorly, out of favor
                        with Tear and Court, detested by the Socialist party and taunted by half the
                        European and American Preas with the certainty of humiliation, Sergius de
                        Witte want to the Congress with every handiosp and returns bearing Peace
                        with Honor. We must acknowledge the moderation of the Japanese but this
                        acknowledgement is in itself a compliment to the influence of the unyielding
                        Russian on his opponents.</p>

                            the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with
                            the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services
                            of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring
                            information on trade matters generally, including the question of
                            appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is
                            obviously in the interests of all British traders hero to become
                            members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription
                            is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy

                        in abeyance, as it is uncertain whether Egyptian law permits the summoning
                        of a shareholder's meeting in such a manner. It is possible that the sole

                    <p>The new hotel at Luxor now being erected by the Upper Egypt Hotels Co., is
                        situated on the river bar à just before Mr. Irsingers' house, known to most
                        tourists as the "Dutchman's castle." The hotel is being built on a site
                        covering eighteen teddans. There will be about 50 rooms, 24 of which will
                        have a bathroom attached. There is also a magnificent ball, and two large
                        covered verandahs, one of which faces the river. Tourists will also find a
                        large billiard room 'and some fine tennis courts. The water supply has also
                        received special attention, an artesian well having been bored for the
                        exclusive use of the hotel. This fine hotel will be opened in the season of
                        1907, and the present Luxor Hotel will bo used as an auxiliary to it</p>
                    <p>The well known Cataract Hotel at Assouan is to be enlarged for the coming
                        season. One new wing is being added on the west side comprising several
                        private suites, and another 40 bedrooms. Mr. Pagnon has also decided to
                        enlarge the present hall, which has always been so much in favor with
                        tourists.</p>
                    <p>The splendid hotel can now accomodate 300 people and it is said that orders
                        are already flowing in for rooms to be reserved. The hotel will open as
                        usual the first week in November.</p>

                    <head>THE CLIMATE OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>There is a generally expressed opinion among most old residents, including
                        Dr. Abbate Pasha, president of the Khedivial Geographical Society, who has
                        resided over 50 years in this country, that the climate of Egypt is
                        undergoing a gradual change and the reason assigned is that, owing to the
                        Assouan Reservoir and the various irrigation works recently established, the
                        area of cultivated land has enormously increased of late, and in consequence
                        the amount of water evaporation is greater. The Suez Canal is also supposed
                        by some to have contributed in bringing about the change.</p>
                    <p>A report was spread some time ago that the Sphinx at Ghizeh disclosed signs
                        of crumbling, owing to those altered meteorological conditions, but careful
                        inquiries showed that the rumours were untrue and Captain Lyons,
                        director-general of the Survey Department, who is an acknowledged authority
                        on such matters, has recently stated that none of the observations made
                        daring late years indicate any gradual or permanent change in the climate.
                        Judging by the experiences of the summer now drawing to a close it certainly
                        does not give residents, especially of Cairo, any reason for thinking that
                        the heat is growing less, for this has been one of the most trying of hot
                        seasons.</p>

                            the Hellenic Government's first care would be the safeguarding of the

                            been given to Mr. Diomedes Saracomenos. This gentleman was for many
                            years Professor of Natural Science in the Gymnasia of Athens, and also a
                            sub-director of the School of Agriculture of that city, and was for

                            that an impetus will now be given to the experimental cultivation of
                            cotton, cereals, and other seeds and plants. It is known that Professor

                            investigations and recom mendations may now, perhaps, be looked for. The

                            measure, upon its water supply, and, of late years, efforts have not
                            been wanting to improve end aug-ment the facilities for irrigation. The
                            formation of large reservoirs in the Messaoria at a considerable expense
                            have not, as yet, fulfilled the hopes that were entertained respecting
                            them, and although, no doubt, that undertaking need not be regarded as
                            valueless, further outlay will, undoubtedly, be needed before these
                            reservoirs can be put to thorough utility. At present they ere mainly
                            dependent upon the river water for their supply, but as this comes down
                            in flood only during a few days in the year, and is then largely tapped
                            by riparian villagers, but a small quantity reaches the reservoirs. If
                            this thorny question could be satisfactorily solved, we should probably
                            see a greet deal of land, now idle, put. into regular cultivation. The
                            attempts at Artesian boring now being carried out at Nicosia are
                            therefore, of intense general interest We understand that the boring has
                            now reached a depth of nearly 350 feet.</p>

                    <dateline>Beyrout, September 1.</dateline>
                    <p>Railway enterprises in Turkey without kilo-metric guarantee are apt to prove
                        financial failures in their incipient stage, things progress so slowly in
                        that Empire. The Beyront-Damsscus narrow gauge line has had particularly
                        disastrous results owing to multifarious reasons. British influence
                        which—thanks to the vigilance and diplomatic skill of its representative has
                        since taken the ascendency - had, at the period of the construction of the
                        line, not quite supplanted French political preponderance in the Lebanon,
                        and France considered herself the chief protector of the semi-independent
                        province, and it is thought that the line was made to wind over such awkward
                        heights of the Mountain chiefly to please the Lebanese and form a sort of
                        iron link to farther knit the friendship, and strengthen the bond between
                        France and its protege. It is not an uncommon thing for the chivalrous
                        French to allow their feelings to get the better of their practical sense.
                        Political and personal reasons caused the railroad to he constructed through
                        a most awkward country, the gradients at some acclivities of the Lebanon
                        being at as much as seven metres per kilometre. Then the extravagances and
                        robberies in the contract department are said to have been so general, that
                        it is estimated the cost of building the line was more than twice as much as
                        it would have been, were the expenditure judicious and the contracts works
                        works entrusted to honest hands, and subjected to proper control.</p>
                    <p>Even then had it not been for the extension to Homs-Hama the concern would
                        still be a losing one. The consumption of coal involved in the crossing of
                        those steep gradients of the Lebanon is enormous, while the capacity of the
                        locomotives is thereby considerably limited. These disabilities have further
                        been accentuated by inadequate management of which there have been, and are
                        still, glaring instances. The catastrophe of the year before last is too
                        notorious to require anything beyond mere mention, while the various minor
                        accidents that occured daring last summer owing to the insufficiency of old
                        locomotives and the large influx of passengers, all point to far from
                        vigilant control and intelligent management The local directors here throw
                        the blame on the central administration, which limits their field of action,
                        and does not encourage any spirit of initiative on their part This is the
                        evil of centralisation, which found its apotheosis in the Russian
                        bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>The passenger service during the summer months yields important receipts, but
                        there is nothing done to improve it Indeed the passengers' comfort would not
                        have been more lightly thought of had all those respectable folks been so
                        many dumb cattle. The first-class carriages are fitted up more wretchedly
                        than third-class carriages in other civilized countries, while the
                        second-class carriages do not differ from cattle trains, except in being
                        fitted up with straight and uncomfortable wooden benches. But this is not
                        all. The windows of the first-class compartments have no blinds, and as the
                        suburban train starts from Beyront at about 5 p.m. the passengers are
                        subjected to a semi-tropical sun for about two hours, while after sunset the
                        primitive looking oil lamps fixed to the ceiling do not sometimes give any
                        light, owing presumably to the bad quality of the oil, or more likely to
                        utter neglect. I had to use up almost a whole match-box' to find my stick on
                        arrival the other day at Aley in the dark.</p>
                    <p>And over and above all this the company imposes such onerous conditions on
                        the passengers, and especially the subscribers among them, and ignores so
                        totally the elementary principles of reciprocity of rights that one is
                        forced to the belief that the company considers the service it performs as a
                        gratuitous one, and one, therefore that should be accepted by the country as
                        a boon.</p>
                    <p>But reform has been known to follow often eat after great abases, and some
                        seem to see signs of awakening on the part of the company, and they put
                        their trust in the change of management. Indeed I have known the present
                        director, while he was yet acting-director, to take such an active and
                        sincere interest in the question of the satisfaction of the passengers that
                        he would in person go at early hoars to the station to see things for
                        himself. The chief cause of complaint was lately the insufficiency of
                        carriages. and it has been decided by the present director that whenever a
                        train was filled a supplementary one should be added, to start soon after
                        the first train, and carry the passengers that had been left behind, thus
                        avoiding en-cumbrance and the danger of straining the locomotive through
                        overloading. A farther grievance is the foot that passengers provided with
                        first-class tickets have sometimes for want of room to go into second-class
                        compartments and vice-versa. Surely the company can know the number of
                        places available and can therefore instruct the ticket clerk not to issue
                        any tickets in excess of the number of places allotted. But let us hope with
                        the optimists that under the new management a new era of reform will be
                        inaugurated. "This is a consummation devoutly to be wished."</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped, however, that reform in other directions will be effect-ed
                        as well. A most injudicious economy i. still being displayed in the
                        remuneration of the staff employes. Ex-chauffeurs with inferior salaries
                        have taken the place of certificated engineer, engaged in France on the
                        initiation of the work of exploitation, regardless of the risk to life and
                        property that this might involve. It is true that the appointments of the
                        French Heads of Depart-ments have also been sensibly reduced, but <cb n="6"/>

                                            the greatest difficulty that the lines can be kept in
                                            position. Many trains from here had to be suspended

                        of the superior and subordinate employes. The latter, upon whom the largest
                        and hardest share of the work devolves, such as station masters, eta, are
                        paid pitiful salaries, and out of all proportion with the output of work
                        performed. Their only fault perhaps is the fact of being natives, for since
                        the company has been able to pay', liberal bonuses to its directors it could
                        have meted out the same treatment to its other servants, who have not
                        contributed lees actively to the development of its business because they
                        are leas conspicuous. The company must realise that insufficiently paid
                        labour must necessarily end by being inefficient, and in their own interest,
                        and in mere consideration of the principles of justice and humanity, it is
                        to be hoped that due attention will he paid to this question of the
                        remuneration of the secondary employes.</p>
                    <p>The extension from Rayak to Homs and Hama is a broad gauge line, and although
                        the passengers on that line are mostly filthy peasants, and men of rather
                        primitive habits, yet the carriages are fitted up in a comparatively
                        luxuriant style.</p>
                    <p>The Homs-Hama extension served to develop, considerably the traffic of the
                        company, and, as a natural corollary, widened the scope of. the commercial
                        activities of Beyrout, while it reduced the port of Tripoli to a nullity.
                        All the exports of wool and grain that used to find outlet at Tripoli have
                        been diverted to Beyront, thanks to the railway. The advantages of rail
                        carriage are manifestly superior to transport by the primitive means of
                        camel and mules. Besides the economy of time and punctual delivery, more or
                        lees, there is the fact of greater security, which is an important
                        consideration for the insurance. But the narrow line of Beyrout seems to
                        fail to answer the requirements of the traffic, and fulfil all these
                        advantages. The grain crops of the Homs and Hama districts being
                        exceptionally abundant this year, it is estimated that no less than 40,000
                        tons of barley, beans, etc. but chiefly cf the first-named article, will be
                        destined for exportation. But I have heard it said that the railway company
                        frankly avowed its inability to carry more than half of this quantity, and
                        the remainder will have to lie over till next year or be transported on
                        camel back to Tripoli As our grain exports are chiefly destined for the
                        United Kingdom, the matter necessarily affects British maritime interests,
                        for loading in a sheltered harbour is infinitely more expeditions than in an
                        open roadstead, and quick despatch is a matter of vital importance to
                        shipping. The present director is doing his best to cope with this increased
                        demand of commerce, and they say that in addition to the six trains that
                        have heretofore been running each way daily between Rayak and Beyrout,
                        another eight trains are to be farther put in use. But the evil is inherent
                        and lies in the defectiveness of the line both to respect of its narrowness
                        and steepness. The tonnage capacity of the trains is by far too
                        restricted.</p>

                    <head>TAXATION IN PALESTINE.</head>
                    <p>Recent events in the Yemen have had a painful effect upon the whole of the
                        Turkish Empire in general, but more especially upon Palestine. The troops
                        that a few months ago marched to the relief of Sana'a, which, after all, was
                        taken by the insurgents, were principally drawn from the Moslem population
                        of Palestine. Bazaar reports, confirmed, it is said, by returned prisoners,
                        whom the victorious rebels allowed to escape into the Aden territory, and
                        who have returned to their respective villages, represent the troops from
                        Syria as absolutely refusing to fight against their co-religionists. As they
                        were literally starving, the Turkish Commissariat being of a notoriously
                        unsatisfactory character, it is alleged that they actually sold their arms
                        in order to purchase food. In these circumstances the Porte has been obliged
                        to send new troops drawn from other provinces, in order to fight the
                        insurgents. The Palestine peasantry has been plunged into mourning on
                        account of relatives lost during the campaign, The writer has been informed
                        that one village alone, containing about 800 souls, which sent 46 men to the
                        front, had received word that 11 of the latter had fallen and 19 are
                        missing. The loss by death falls entirely upon the Moslem popalation, it
                        having been the policy of the Moha medan rulers, ever since they took
                        Jerusalem iDA.D. 637, to exolade Jews and Christiana from the army, which,
                        however, they are so heavily taxed to support, that many of the Christians
                        have been forced to leave the country. It is reported that from one
                        Christian village alone, that of Belt Jala, 35 families lately left for
                        America. Their emigration, however, till quite recently, instead of bringing
                        relief, only increased the burden that had to be borne by the special
                        religious community to which the emigrants belonged, and which was
                        responsible to the Government for the taxes, especially the military tax,
                        payable for those who thus left their birthplace.</p>
                    <p>Although, in his famous Hatt-i-Humayan, 1856, Saltan Abdul Medjid promised
                        that all subjects of the Porte should enjoy equal privileges, and that
                        Christians should be permitted to serve as soldiers, yet the general effect
                        of the edict was to rouse suspicion and distrust amongst Christians and
                        Moslems alike; and so the provisions of the Hatt had never been carried
                        out.</p>
                    <p>"To carry on war successfully," said Taronne, "three things are
                        needed-namely, money, money, and again money ;" and though by the 1
                        antiquated system of taxation in use up to a few weeks ago the Porte managed
                        to squeeze huge sums out of its loyal subjects, yet it has lately discovered
                        that by ostensibly copying European systems and astutely combining them with
                        the old it can squeeze more. Hitherto, the authorities refused to recognize
                        individuals when levying the military tax, which was nominally two
                        medjidies, about 78, a head per male, and arbitrarily assessed thei
                        religious community to which he belonged for a lump sum which greatly
                        exceeded, when divided up amongst individuals on the spot, what would
                        otherwise have been paid into the exchequer had each man been allowed to pay
                        the sum due by himself personally. The way the money was raised was as
                        follows: Bach religious community had its Mukhtar, or elective
                        representative, who, in conjunction with a committee composed mainly of the
                        clergy and influential lay members, di vided up the sum demanded of the
                        whole community. If a member of the community had left it, his kafil, or
                        surety, had to pay for him, or get other relations of the delinquent
                        absentee to do so. Even ahoald the absentee die abroad, his share had to be
                        raised somehow, for a Turkish subject living in other countries-the United
                        States, for instancewas considered immortal unless the Turkish Embassy at
                        Washington sent a certificate of E his death, a thing which the Embassy was
                        not likely to do. Now, however, by the new arrangements, special officials
                        have been appointed to collect the military tax (which has o been raised
                        from 7s. to 13s.) from each individual male, Christian or Jew, whilst it
                        seems that the communities will still have (unless their attempts to get
                        themselves freed from the obligation be successfal) to pay the military
                        taxes due from their own poor and t absentees.</p>
                    <p>Besides the "reform" in the matter of, t military taxes, the following new
                        ones have been introduced, payable by all Ottoman subjects, wheter Mohamedan
                        or other :-</p>
                    <p>1. A "Road Construction and Repair" tax of 16 piastros, equal to 3e. 4d.
                        levied on every person.</p>
                    <p>2. A registration-tax of 6d, equal to 3 piastres, on every person, adult or
                        juvenile.</p>
                    <p>3. An income-tax or from 50 to 500 piastres t per annum on Jews and
                        Christians, and of from 50 to 200 piastres on Moslems not in the Government
                        service, whilst Moslem officials are muleted in an amount equivalent to one
                        month's salary, of which, as it is, they very rarely receive more than a
                        portion.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the harvest taxation, the old t system in vogue in Roman
                        times, of selling or e farming the tithes to the highest bidder, is still,
                        with all its attendant, evils, in force, and is this year sggravated by
                        ordera from Constantinople that double tithes are to be collected, an
                        nngrateful task which, it is said, the Pasha is himself travelling about the
                        country to perform. The taxes on landed property, &amp;o, have also been
                        raised, though it is not clear to what i amount, and a new tax on animals,
                        which even the Europeans are obliged to pay, has been introduced. Notice has
                        been given, directed against the Jews, that all foreigners who are not
                        recognized at their respective Consulates, and registered there, will have
                        to leave the country or become Turkish subjects, in which latter contingency
                        they become liable not only to be taxed as above indicated, but also to be
                        fined and pay up arrears for themselves and their children. In consequence
                        of this order it is reported that the different Consulates are besieged with
                        applications for registration and protection</p>

                    <head>DRUIDS AT STONEHENGE</head>
                    <p>A waggish chronicler, Longtoft, records that "A wander wit of Wiltshire,
                        rambling to Rome to gaze at antiquities and there skrewing himsslf into the
                        company of antiquarians, they entreated him to illustrate unto them that
                        famous monument in his country called Stonage. His answer was that he had
                        never seen, soaroe ever heard of it; whereupon they kicked him out of doors
                        and bade him goe home and see Stonage." We shall see reason to believe that
                        Stonehenge is the most ancient considerable work of man's hands in these
                        islands.</p>
                    <p>Recently the famous monoliths and trilithons were the scene of ceremonial and
                        convi viality, very unlike, it may be, the rites and ceremonies of ages ago,
                        and yet recalling some of the pomp and ritual of those far-off times. The
                        ancient order of Druids assembled in their hundreds, if not in their
                        thousands, to accomplish "a souvenir and an excursion to Stonehenge," and to
                        initiate, amid the surroundings of these moss-grown, age-weathered
                        monuments, new members of their order. Convenient trains left Waterloo
                        early, conveying not merely the members of metropolitan and provincial Grand
                        Lodges, but also what is of equal moment in your modern "convivial,
                        fraternal, and philanthropio societies," those properties which are the
                        paraphernalia of their mystery. Arrived at Amesbury, which is the nearest
                        town to Stonehenge, the brethren were conveyed by brakes to the famous spot
                        on Salisbury Plain; and then, luncheon over, came the event of the day, the
                        ceremony of initiation, by which Sir Edmund Antrobus, Bart, and some thirty
                        others were introduced into the secrets and rights of the Order.</p>
                    <p>In the very olden days there was a real processional way in connection with
                        most of these sacred circles of stones. They can still be discerned. But the
                        modern Draid was content to make the way lined by the brethren, And to push
                        the "profanum valgus," the rreverent crowd, aside. Nobody seemed greatly
                        intent to learn what the mysteries were, except some few newspapers men,
                        who, for the joke of the thing, joined the initiates. The procession from
                        the refreshment tent to an improvised altar, near, if not within the puter
                        circle of the prehistoric stones, was curious, if not imposing. There were
                        bards in white robes and hoods, Druids bearing long rods, with scythe-shaped
                        crooks at the end to but the sacred oak or the mistletoe, and Grand Draids
                        in many-coloured robes of purple, green, blue, and other hues, and ancients
                        with long, nowy boards, that really would have looked Druids had it not been
                        for those weird blocks hard by that seemed to cry out, "Not the real hing.
                        Buried is the irrevocable past, and you Dannot bring it to life again."</p>
                    <p>All the mysteries of initiation were in the Open. What happened, what
                        terrible vows were xacted, what promises made, what veils coverng the arcana
                        of Druidism were lifted may not be said. But everything was grand; the Most
                        Noble Grand Arch G. A. Larnder, the Vice Grand Arch, the Grand Secretary,
                        and all the other grand officials did their best to dignify the occasion;
                        and so far as could be earned everything went grandly. In truth, this
                        ceremonial picnic at Stonehenge is much to be ncouraged. Those mighty stones
                        are a marvellous piece of our island story. There are two circles, an inner
                        and outer. The outer was once of huge upright stones, with others resting on
                        them, the whole forming a circuit of 300ft. The inner is of smaller
                        blocksmany of them now fallen-obviously loss wrought, if, indeed, ever
                        worked at all, with one or two exceptions. There are no such tones in the
                        neighbourhood now. Salisbury Plain covers a chalk formation. Whence, then,
                        id those hoary builders get their huge blocks, and how carry them to where
                        they are ? It is probable that geology answers the question. One lot of
                        stones may be "sarsen" stones, the bris of the Woolwich and Reading beds;
                        here are vast numbers of such stones in some of the Wiltshire valleys.
                        Farther, there are blue stones," so called, that have probably Deen carried
                        here with the drift of the glacial period, as suggested by Professor Judd.
                        The upposed transport of great blocks over long istances did not take place.
                        More likely is it hat those early Britons found the stones on he Salisbury
                        table-land, and they suggested he building of the temple.</p>
                    <p>Was it a temple 1 Yes, and thereby hangs a pretty story of science. Sir
                        Norman Lockyer aving examined the san and star temples of Egypt, and Mr.
                        Penrose having investigated he temples of Greece, and both having proved
                        From astronomical data the probability that the wery age of these structures
                        could be learnt From the stars, set to work to test the antiquiy of
                        Stonehenge by the same methods. They rrived at the conclusion that
                        Stonehenge was solar temple, that its old priests (Draids or re-Draid) were
                        early astronomers, and that a ine drawn from the altar straight through the
                        vente marked by the stones of the circle and he famous one outside, the
                        Friar's Heel, pointd to the spot where the sun rose on Midsumher Day about
                        1,700 B.C. There had been two mples, and this conclusion referred to the
                        atter. Curiously enough, Lord Avebary, who is n authority in pre-historic
                        archeology, assigned he period to the Bronze Age, and Professor Howland to
                        the Neolithic Age, which, accordmg to Sir John Evans, would be from 1,400 o
                        2,000 B.C. The astronomers and those who were guided by the flint implements
                        found at Stonehenge thus closely agreed.</p>
                    <p>And that is a wondrous bit of our island fory-that there were men in Wilts at
                        least 3,600 years ago, capable of erecting these pillars and circles of
                        stone, and noting with xactitude the solstitial year-which means, of course,
                        that long before the Christian era some real civilisation was existent in
                        Britain. Der says of the Draids, "They taught many hings about the stars and
                        their motions, of <cb n="3"/> the size of the earth, the nature of things,
                        and the power and majesty of the immortal goda." Possibly; bat Caesar was
                        writing, it may be, secondhand information, and we need not attach too much
                        weight to his account. Not Cesar, nor Imperial Rome, had been heard of when
                        Stonehenge was put up, and those remains are more eloquent than any words of
                        his can be. What would be the amazement of those buried ancients could they
                        learn that the chipped flints they left behind them and the stars in the
                        skies had told us what they were doing between three and four thousand years

                    <p>According to latest reports, the cotton trade in the County Palatine is again
                        prosperous, and, b.yond minor dispates which are coutinually cropping up in

                        the number of operatives in harness was further augmented, particularly in

                        airculated for their special behoof by interested parties, are being rapidly
                        dissipated, the general opinion being that there will be an abun dant

                        especially spinners, taking up shares.</p>
                    <p>That speculators have confidence in the future of the industry is evident by
                        their readi ness to provide capital for the flotation of new milla, upwards
                        of two million pounds worth of new mill property at the present tine being
                        in course of erection in the Oldham, Rochdale, Ecoles, Pendlebury,
                        Farnworth, Atherton and Bolton neighbourhoods. In Bolton area alone there
                        are between 40 and 50 mills, containing, roughly, four millions of spindles.
                        Amongst the largest hareholdera in some concerns are textile machinists,
                        who, of course, are looking for orders for equipment. The average cost of
                        modern mills is £1 per spindle, so that a faotory containing 90,000 spindles
                        oosts £90,000. It is questioned whether in some quarters, in face of he
                        growing competition abroad, this wholen'e building of new mills in
                        warranted. Many experts are afraid that older concerns will have to go under
                        if the building mania continues.</p>
                    <p>Disgusted with their treatment, disappointed with their rates of pay, and
                        allured by the prospects of better trade at home, many Lancashire cotton
                        operatives who have gone out to the United States and Canada are returning
                        to the old country. In some Lancashire manufactaring localities there is now
                        actually a dearth of capable weavers, and the ranks of the workers in the
                        spinning branch, with the opening of so many new mills, are not overcrowded.
                        Though the cotton season is supposed to have finished, consignments continue
                        to reach the docks both from Amerion and Egypt. Daring the past week the
                        "Ascuncion de Larringa" and the "Manchester Commerce" arrived, the first
                        carrying 8,559 bales from Galveston, and the second 526 bales from
                        Philadelphia. Those advanced the season's shipment to 548,475 bales, a
                        number far away in excess of that recorded at this time in any previous
                        year. The shipment at the corre sponding date last year was 364,542 bales,
                        in 1903 478,136 bales, and in 1902 420,186 bales. It will thus be seen that
                        the record has been exceeded by over 70,000 bales. There is also a very
                        happy state of affairs in conneetion with the Egyptian shipment. Previous
                        records have been broken, and the canal company are justly proud of the
                        achievement, especially seeing that the total imports of cotton to England
                        have fallen off this season as compared with last. Altogether Manchester
                        received from Alexandria 183,552 bales, as against 148,143 at the
                        corresponding date last year and 145,140 in 1903. Last September the canal
                        company made strenuous efforts to induce shippers to use the canal and to
                        make this the best season on record. It must be very gratifying to all
                        concerned to find that their endeavours have met with so much success.</p>
                    <p>The week's traffic was rather heavier than usual. Many big boats arrived and
                        sailed from the dooks, which were always a scene of much activity. Several
                        consignments of timber reached the crowded storage grounds, one of the
                        heaviest being brought from Chatham, N.B., by the "Therese." As usual, oil,
                        grain, general merchandise and cattle arrived in large quantities, while
                        plenty of cargo of a miscellaneous order was taken from Manches ter by the
                        outgoing vessels.</p>

                    <head>MOSQUITOES AND BANANAS.</head>
                    <p>"The Fruit Grower" in a recent issue sounded a note of alarm on the subject
                        of mosquitoes, which it was asserted, are imported with the bananas which
                        come from Central and South American ports. The paper added that "the
                        mosquito threatens to become a serious danger to the public health in this
                        country."</p>
                    <p>On this subject the managing director of Messrs. Elder and Fyffes, Limited,
                        the principal banana importing firm in England, said: "It is perfectly
                        ridiculous to talk of morquitoes coming with bananas from either Jamaica or
                        Costa Rica. The mosquito bred out there comes into existence at a place
                        where the temperature is anything from 120 degrees. The bananas come over in
                        boats which have an insulated or refrigerating chamber.</p>
                    <p>"The temperature is 49 degrees at the outset, and possibly 51 degrees when it
                        reaches the fruit, and the mosquito certainly could not stand that. Of
                        course, 1 have heard both of insects and animals that can be frozen into a
                        state of torpidity, but which on being thawed out turn out quite as lively
                        as ever again, but the mosquito is not one of them.</p>
                    <p>"I have been in the trade now for a good many years, and I have never seen a
                        mosquito either from Jamaica or Costa Rica, neither have I had any
                        complaints on the subject from any of my men.</p>
                    <p>"I have always understood that the life of a mosquito does not extend beyond
                        one day. Upon this point I am not sure, bat, anyhow, we have it on the
                        authority of Professor Boyce and Major Ross that it is very short-lived, the
                        period of existence being only a few days at the outside. Under those
                        circumstances, it is quite impossible that they can be imported from the
                        places named, as the voyage takes eighteen or nineteen daya."</p>
                    <p>Bat we certainly have had an extraor dinary visitation of mosquitoes this
                        summer," remarked our representative. Where do you suggest they come from
                        1"</p>
                    <p>"It is possible that they may be brought over with the bananas from the
                        Canary Islands. The boats from those islands have no cold storage rooms. The
                        bananas are packed in a wrapper of cotton wool, then in newspaper, and then
                        put into the crates. Under these conditions the insect might survive, but
                        even about that I am doubtful, in view of their short existence. Personally
                        I have never come across a mosquito in Canary Island consignments."</p>
                    <p>Then, where do you suggest that they come from 1"</p>
                    <p>"I am more inolined to the opinion that they come over in timber cargoes.
                        When wood has been in process of unloading at the docks I have often had my
                        attention drawn to the number of mosquitoes about."</p>
                    <p>"Why do you think it is the timber they come in 1"</p>
                    <p>"Well, it may be because they are attracted by the aroma of the timber, or it
                        may be that it is their natural ground. You must remember, too, that there
                        are as many mosquitoes in the swampy regions of Basex as there are in Egypt
                        or Central America, in proportion to the size of the place."</p>
                    <p>"What about mosquitoes as an infectious disease spreading agency 1"</p>
                    <p>That is as riculous sa the other idea. If the mosquitoes do not come they
                        cannot well be the agents in dieseminating disease. I take it that the
                        disease referred to is yellow fever. Well, suppose, for the sake of
                        argument, that the mosquitoes do come, I am quite confident that the yellow
                        fever does not come with them." "On what grounds do you base your confidence
                        1"</p>

                        The yellow fever germ de velops in five days.</p>
                    <p>"On this subject I am in perfect agreement with Mr. A. W. Preston, president
                        of the United Fruit Company, of Boston. His firm import 30,000,000 bunches
                        of bananas annually, and so he ought to be an authority on the subject. He
                        is in this building at the present moment. We have discussed the subject
                        together, and, as I say, we are in perfect agree ment thereon."</p>
                    <p>The chief of the Fruit Distributing Company said to our representative: "The
                        insects which come over with the bananas are not really mosquitoes. They are
                        a kind of goat. The cold in the refrigerating rooms of the banana boata
                        would be absolutely fatal to mosquitoes,"</p>
