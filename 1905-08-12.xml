                    <head>THE PROSPECTS OF PEACE.</head>
                    <p>We cannot say that the latest news from the United States gives any sore hope
                        of peace. M. de Witte has reiterated, time oat of mind, that Russia will pay
                        no war indemnity, and even though the tribute levied oo the vanquiahed be
                        styled "a reimbursement for war expenses"—an expression we oan cordially
                        recommend to future conqueror*—we doubt whether all the gilding in the world
                        will make Russia swallow the pilL The long delay since the victory of Mokdan
                        has once more given the Russians time to reorganise their foroes and fill op
                        their gaps, and though Qeneral Iinievitch does not bear the reputation of a
                        great strategist, and refugees from the scene of action tell stories of
                        demoralisation and incipient matiny among his soldiers, still, it must be
                        remembered that similar tales have been spread abroad since Liao Yang, and
                        that, in spite of them all, the Russian armies have never been routed, in
                        the tense ol being not only defeated, bat demoralised for a considerable
                        period after their defeat ; that, with the ooe exception of Port Arthur,
                        avoidable surrenders on a large soale have been unknown; and that the
                        Russian soldier, in spite of his iacompetent officers and imperfect
                        training, always fights stubbornly, and retreats with regret The viotory of
                        Tsushima has saved Japan from all risk at defeat and has assured Liautong,
                        Korea Md Bsfbalien to her soldiers, bat the Russian armies may fight a
                        retreating battle, draw away to Lake Baikal or the Upper Amor valley, and,
                        maintaining half a million man there, weary the Japeoese, who will be
                        obliged to tutataio an approximately qual force in</p>
                    <p>Manchuria, into a compromiao. In the ahock of battle the Japanese are perhaps
                        invincible , but will even the heroes of the Shaho, Mukden, and Port Arthur
                        prove themselves human after another two years of indecisive war t In the
                        itixUsnth c-tntury one of the ablest of Asiatics, Toyotomi Hideyoahi, the
                        Taiko-sama, or Great Lord, as the worshipper* at the shrine of his soul call
                        him, led Japan to a five years' war of oinqueet in Korea against the Chinese
                        and Koreans, which ended in the failure of all his plans, not so much
                        through iU-euooess, as through the bitter home-sickness which is one of the
                        prioea a patriotic army has to pay for a long campaign across the seas. Our
                        soldier* undoubtedly grew homaiiok and 'stale' in South Africa, and it will
                        be atrange if even the mo*t ardent Japaneee soldier ha* not aome of the edge
                        taken ofi hi* martial temper *fter more rainy aummen and icy winter.- in the
                        Manchurian plains.</p>
                    <p>AU will depend, in our opinion, on the ability of Russia to play a long,
                        slow, and unattractive game, without hope of any real victory—for the prisee
                        of the.war must be to the Japaneee—but simply and solely with a view to
                        making the peaoe terms leu onerous. And we submit that on this point the
                        Russians themselves are the only possible judges. Were the revolutionary
                        party in Russia led by oapable men, a long war might lead to the tall of the
                        Tsardom, bat the earning cruise of the Potemkin, the failure of the striker*
                        at Odessa to do more than provoke a nmnere, and the fact that a large
                        section of the Russian people •teem* contented with the promite* of relorm
                        solemnly affirmed by the Tsar, makes us inclined to suspect that the Tsar'e
                        government will take the risk* of revolution. Bat a long struggle in the
                        Bast must still further weaken Russian infiuence and prestige in the West,
                        and from this obvious decline of her infiuence and prestige, mast be born
                        the inducements to make peaoe quickly with the Japaneee. The mast
                        pro-Gercn«a Russian cannot but feel dismayed at tho growth of German
                        influence in theNearEi*t,theadvooato of expansion in the Middle Bast must
                        feel alarm at tho rapid extension of British infiuence in the Persian Gulf;
                        and it must be a galling reflection that Russia oau have now no say in
                        Scandinavian politics, and oannot offer France more than platonio support in
                        Moroooo. Thirty years ago Russia might perhaps have abandoned western
                        politios and striven for years to minimise defeat in theEtst,but events move
                        rapidly now-a-days, and Russia's effaoe meat as a European power for a few
                        years may prove a terrible handicap to her for another generation.</p>

                            His Majesty, after having admired the fine decoration in question on his
                            way, sent a telephone message from the Elysée to the Direction of the
                            Berlitz School to declare his satisfaction. Alphonse XIII, studied by

                        after lunch went down to bathe from the beach. There are apparently no boats
                        at this part of the shore, and no regular bathing place, the public bathing
                        at their own risk.</p>
                    <p>As far as can be gathered, Capt, Stokes, while swimming about 120 yards ont,
                        was seized with an attack of syncope. Capt. Carey, who was a strong swimmer,
                        at once came. to his rescue, but, in attempting to aid him, was himself
                        caught by the current and carried ont. He called for help, but to the shame
                        of the crowd of about a hundred persons, mostly natives, who stood on the
                        shore, no one stirred, with the exception of Capt Crawley, A.S.C., who,
                        though. suffering from the effects of a wound received in South Africa, made
                        two gallant but unsuccessfal efforts to rescue the drowning officers at
                        considerable personal risk. About ten minutes after Capt. Carey bad last
                        been seen his body came to the surface nearer the shore, and was brought in.
                        Attempts were imme liately made to restore consciousness and Drs. Kanzky and
                        Ambinini, who arrived some twenty minutes later, did all that was in their
                        power, but their efforts were unavailing. The body of Captain Stokes was
                        discovered near the beach an hour later.</p>

                    <head>THE ZOO'S NEW ADDITIONS.</head>
                    <p>A SPLENDID COLLECTION.</p>
                    <p>We mentioned in our issue of Thursday that Captain Plower, Director of the
                        Zoological Gardens at Ghizeh, had arrived early that morning in Cairo on his
                        return from an expedi tion to the Sudan with a large and varied collection
                        of wild animals, reptiles, and birds to add to the already magnificent
                        collection to be found in the gardens. Several of the new additions are rare
                        specimens, a few not having been seen in this country before, and the whole
                        lot just arrived are well worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>The total number of mammals in the new collection are fifty, the most
                        important being fifteen cub lions captured in all parts of the Sudan by
                        natives, and presented by different Anglo-Egyptian officiale This lot is
                        intended for the Government of India, who have asked for them to be sent out
                        and in return promised to present the Egyptian Government with a collection
                        of Indian animals for the Cairo Zoc. These lions will be forwarded shortly
                        to nez for shipment to Bombay and Calcutta, some being for the Calcutta Zoo,
                        and the rest to be given as presents to reigning Rajahs. The ages of the
                        animals vary from three to ten months, the younger ones being very docile,
                        and playful as kittens.</p>
                    <p>Amongst the collection is a very handsome female giraffe from Kordofan, just
                        over eleven feet high, which will soon be rent away to Constantinople, as a
                        gift to the Sultan from the Khedive, at whose special request it was brought
                        down from Khartoum,</p>
                    <p>With the exception of the above two lots, the rest of the recent arrivals are
                        intended for the local Zoo. The first as regards importance, and which are
                        the most interesting, are three baby elephants, captured by Arabs in the
                        opper waters of the Blue Nile, and are aa playful as the cab lion's
                        mentioned above. One of theee was presented by Captain McMurdo, D.S.O.,
                        Director of the Slave Trade Department, and the other two were purchased.
                        These elephants: are from eight to ten months old, and are very rarely found
                        in captivity, those now in Cairo being most probably the first ever brought
                        there, only about half a dozen others being known to exist in the different
                        zoological gardens of the world. These alone are well worth seeing.</p>
                    <p>Another interesting new specimen is a Ratel (Mellivora Ratel), brought from
                        Renk on the White Nile, and presented by Mr. L. Gorringe of the Slave Trade
                        Department. This animal belongs to the badger family, and is the first of
                        its kind exhibited at the Ghiseh gardens,. The reptiles in the collection
                        number fourteen. These include six crocodiles, all from the Blue Nile; three
                        are only a few months old and the largest is about seven and a half feet
                        long. The other reptiles are two river turtles from the Blue Nile; three
                        terrapins or water tortoises (Sternotharus Adansoni) from the White Nile,
                        presented by Bimbashi Scott-Hill, R.N.; two leopard tortoises (Testudo
                        Pardalis) from Bor, on the White Nile. One of these latter was presented by
                        Bimbashi the Hon. M. P. Macnaghten, and the other by Captain B. L. Mears, of
                        the A.S.C. at Khartoum.</p>
                    <p>The new collection of birds brought by. Captain Flower numbers sixty-four in
                        all, belonging to twenty different species. The more important among these
                        include a fish eagle from the White Nile, the first of its kind exhibited,
                        and which was presented by Mr. G. B. Middleton; two Senegal or saddle-billed
                        storke from the Sobat River in the south of the Sadan, which are very rare
                        birds to be found in collections. They were presented by Dr. H. T.
                        MacLaughlan, of the American Mission. Last, but not least, amongst the fine
                        lot of the feathered tribe is a glossy starling from the White Nile. This is
                        a very pretty bird,and the first of its species seen at Ghizsh. It was given
                        by Mr. A. L. Butler, head of the Game Preservation Department at
                        Khartoum,</p>
                    <p>Captain Flower, was away for just three months, having left Cairo on the 11th
                        May, and having travelled during that time 3,600) miles by river and road,
                        going as far as Rosaires on the Blue Nile, where a great deal of rain was
                        encountered. It took from five to six weeks to reach Cairo on the return
                        journey, Rosaires having been left on the 2nd July. The constant rains were
                        the cause of almost all the Egyptian keepers being laid up with malarial
                        fever, which lasted during most of the return journey. The animals,
                        reptiles, and birds were brought from different focalities, and collected at
                        Khartoum, whence the entire collection was conveyed to Waly Halfa by goods
                        train, and from the latter place down the river to Cairo by sailing boats
                        which were towed part of the way by Government steamer, and the rest by one
                        of Cook's express steamers. Great difficulty was encountered on the journey
                        down in finding sufficient quantities of meat and milk for the animals bat,
                        fortunately, no hitch occurred,and the entire number arrived at their
                        destination in excellent condition. Captain Flower was in capital health
                        daring the whole trip, despite the intense heat at most times, and was
                        unaccompanied by any other Baropean. The expedition, besides. himself,
                        consisted of eleven Egyptians, one Bedouin, and one negro, all of whom
                        returned safely, notwithstanding the attacks of malarial fever.</p>
                    <p>Besides the collection of animals for the Zoo, another was made of some sixty
                        specimens of many species of Nile fish, at the request of the British
                        Museum, These were preserved in spirits, and will be utilised for the forth-
                        coming report to be published by the Egyptian Government in conjunction with
                        the Museum authorities in London. This report will be mainly founded on the
                        splendid collection made for the Government by Mr. W. L. 8. Loat a few years
                        ago, during three seasons.</p>

                    <p>London, August 11.</p>
                    <p>The cricket match which was played on the Crystal Palace Grounds between
                        Egypt and the London County XI. on the 9th and 10th inst. ended in a fairly
                        even draw. London County, who had the first choice of innings, made 293 runs
                        at their first attempt, and Egypt replied with 161 runs. On going in a
                        second time London County made 154 for five wickets, when they declared, and
                        Egypt batted with much better result than in the first innings, scoring 116
                        runs for the loss of only two wickets, at which point stumps were drawn, and
                        the match left undecided. Details will follow by the first mail.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I bave read the interesting article in your issue of Saturday,
                            headed "Lord Cromer- His Life and Work" by Mr. Harold Spender. Int it
                            the writer writes as follows: "The next step was to reduce taxation and
                            that process is still anfinished. But the severest burdens have been
                            relaxed. The tax on sheep and goats, the tax on all trades and crafts,
                            the tax on fishing, all these, and many other smaller but still
                            oppressive burdens, have been remitted." I beg to point out to you, Mr.
                            Editor, that this is not correct, for it is well known that both the
                            Egyptian Cotton Mills, Cairo, and the Alexandria Spinning and Weaving
                            Company,. Ltd, have to pay at the present time excise duty to the extent
                            of 8% (lesa 20%) on the values of all goods manufactured by them. These
                            are the only manufacturers taxed in Egypt, please note. It has been said
                            that this duty has been imposed to protect Lancashire. How on earth on
                            this imposition protect Lancashire manufacturers The only way of
                            protecting them is by closing the mills altogether so that they cannot
                            manufacture the like goods.</p>
                        <p>If the mills here can work at all, there is no protection by imposing a
                            duty of this sort, and it only resolves itself into a tax on Egyptian
                            labor, as all the workpeople are Arabs,and this imposition comes out or
                            the pockets of the shareholders, who are, excepting a very few,
                            residents of Egypt.-I am, Sir, etc., </p>

                    <p>Un fait digne de remarque c'est que l'argent a renchéri en Europe où le taux
                        d'escompte haussé de 1 3/4 2 1/4. Quant au naméraire local, il est difficile
                        de rien préciserà son égard, va le grand nombre de banques nouvelles qui se
                        sont récemment établies ici. Le Comptoir National d'Escompte dont on connait
                        Pétat Horissant aiders beaucoup au développement des affaires. Grâce aux
                        facilités qu'il offre, plusieurs clients mécontents de trop étroites
                        exigeances de leur banque ont.déjà passé chez lui avec armes et bagages. Le
                        Banco di Roma a également contribué depuis 3 mois à faciliter, les échanges
                        par l'empressement qu'il met à avancer sur les titres de premier ordre avec
                        une marge raisonnable. Nous aurons aussi prochainement la Banque de
                        Salonique qui dé- pend, comme on le sait, de la K. &amp; K. Oeste reische
                        Landerbank, Nous espérons qu'avec ces nouvelles banques,, notre marché
                        recevra l'appoint qui lui manquait.</p>
                    <p>On ne sait encore rien de précis à propos de ia Banque d'Abyssinie.
                        Aussin'a-t-on pas traité d'affaires cette semaine. La version la plus"
                        accréditée serait que les actions de cette nonvelle Banque seront lancées
                        sur le marché an moyen d'une émission publique...</p>
                    <p>L'Agricole débute à 14 1/8 pour cloturer à 14 1/32. On s'attend à une reprise
                        à la rentrée des capitalistes d'Europe. La Nouvelle fléchit de 9 9/16 à 9
                        7/16 acheteurs. L'ex right est de 1,8 au-dessus parce qu'elle a droit au
                        coupon de l'année courante. De 1,035 la Part de Fondatear monte à £1,045 si
                        la vague ru mear d'après laquelle on diviserait ces Parts en centièmes se
                        réalisait, le cours de cette valeur hausserait sensiblement, selon toute:
                        apparence.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank fléchit de 27 7/16 à 27 5/16 pour remonter en clôture à 27
                        3/8, La Nou velle suit les mêmes fluctuations, avec 1/32 de différence en
                        moins.</p>
                    <p>De 9 3/8 la Land Bank monte à 9 1/2, prix auquel elle clôture.</p>
                    <p>L'Action Crédit Foncier flactae 'entre-818 et 822 pour finir à 820 acheteurs.
                        Li hausse des Parts de Fondateur s'accentue rapidement de 9,350 à 9,900; on
                        s'attend à des cours encore plus élevés après la combinaison avec la Daira
                        qui fera spécialement bénéficier les Parts de Fondateur.</p>
                    <p>En raison de la distribution d'an dividende intérimaire de P.T. 20 et de
                        rumeurs favorables concernant l'établissement d'une succursale à Londres et
                        une émission nouvelle en décembre, la Cassa di Sconto monte de 186 à 195.
                        Elle clôture &amp; 193.</p>
                    <p>La Banque d'Athènes demeure stationnaire entre 127.1/4 et 127 3/4. Le dernier

                        Sanieh tombe gradualle ment jusqu'à 28, mais reprend légèrement en clotare
                        28 1/16. L'incertitude où l'on est encore au sujet des détails de la
                        liquidation pousse nombre de spéculateurs à se retirer, mais les
                        capitalistes n'en sont pas ébranlés et conti-. nuent à garnir leurs
                        portefeuilles.</p>
                    <p>La Deterred Daïra tombe également de 181 179.</p>

                        Dividendee entre 340 et 342.</p>

                        du Caire de 11301155.</p>
                    <p>Ce sont encore d'importants ordres d'achat. de la Capitale qui ont occasionné
                        une forte poussée des Upper Egypt Hotels. De 4 15/16 le prix est monté hier
                        à 5 15/32 pour finir à 5 S.S. Comme, en effet, la saison des touristes.

                        l'aubaine.</p>
                    <p>La Nungovich est très ferme à 10 8/16. Les Egyptian Hotels (Baebler) haussent
                        de 2.7/16 29/16 et les Splendid Hotels de 4 3/16. 4 5/16.</p>
                    <p>Came d'abord à 22/9, les Markets sont ramontés soudain à 34, cours auquel ils
                        oldtarent en forte demande. Comme, en dépit de la fermeture des marchés à
                        bestiaux à cause de In reste bovine, les recettes ne laissent pas d'être
                        satisfaisantes, les acheteurs augurent de ce fait une ère de prospérité dès
                        que le fléati Ayant disparu les marchés fonctionneront de nouveau.</p>
                    <p>De 35/6 la Salt and Soda monte à 36/3 mais retombe bientôt à (35/7).</p>

                        15/16. L'affaire de terrain que cette sociétés dernièrement conglue au Caire
                        passe pour excellente.</p>
                    <p>On a fait plusieurs centaines d'Oasis entre 1 1.8 et 1 5/32. Le Nile Cold

                    <p>D'une façon générale on peut dire dès à pré- sent que la Bourse a déjà
                        escompté en partie l'insuccès des négociations de paix ruse japonaises, mais
                        il va sans dire que le doute d'un écheo transformé en certitude affecterait
                        défavorablement les marobés de tous les pays. Bi au contraire tout
                        s'arrange, l'avenir se pré ente sous les plus riants présages,</p>
