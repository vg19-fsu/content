                    <head> THE TURKISH DANGER. </head>
                    <p>In a leading article published yesterday, our contemporary "L'Egypte" makes
                        the somewhat astonishing assertion that the question of Akaba (or rather of
                        Tabah) is no longer so Egyptian question. "The prosperity of the Country,"
                        we are informed, 'is not bound up with the possession of the kilometres of
                        sand and pebbles contained in the triangle Suez-Akaba-El-Areesh." In our
                        opinion this view is not only mistaken but dangerous. It is all very well to
                        assert that the Sinai is a useless possession and that Europe can be relied
                        upon to keep watch and ward over the Suez Canal, but in our opinion such an
                        assertion betrays a curious blindness to certain military and political
                        factors which most be reckoned with in any appreciation of the actual
                        situation. Assuming that the Powers are ready to prevent any interference
                        with the Suez Canal, is it so certain that they will be able to do so if the
                        Sinai becomes an Ottoman sandjak and the Eastern bank of the Canal is
                        commanded by forts? Are they, singly or collectively, ready to maintain
                        squadrons in the vicinity of Port Said and Suez to guard against a coup de
                        main ? Are they all prepared to give guarantees that no military operations
                        whatever shall be carried on in that narrow ditch and its immediate
                        neighbourhood ? Will France, Italy, or Germany, if engaged in any European
                        or in any important colonial conflict, agree to immobilize a part of their
                        naval forces which may be required elsewhere ? We greatly doubt it and hold
                        rather that there is nothing to prevent the Turks, once established in
                        Sinai, from csing any opportunity afforded them by a European conflict or
                        political crisis to present the guarantors with a fait accompli—nothing,
                        that is, except the local resistance that each action would inevitably
                        provoke. Again, if ships of war daring a naval campaign can pass through the
                        canal, provided that they maintain its neutrality, cannot armies cross it
                        under the same conditions ? England landed troops at Ismailia in 1882:
                        what-but the Egyptian forces, in which we include the Army of
                        Occupation—could prevent Turkey following England's example and justifying
                        the action by British precedents ? It may be urged that we are imputing
                        wildly ambitious designs to an Empire which has been declared moribund for
                        generations. In our opinion the losses of Turkey in Europe have been
                        counterbalanced by her gains in Asia, and while we hope that the Porte has
                        no designs on Egypt, we cannot but recognise that the proverb, "the appetite
                        grows with eating," is peculiarly applicable to nations and Empires, The
                        Ottoman Oliver Twist, after munching the dry cracknel of the Sinai
                        Peninsula, may ask for more refreshing food, and be is in a far better
                        position that his parallel to gratify his desires. Again, is there no truth
                        in all we have heard of the Pan-Islamio movement which aims at freeing all
                        Moslem lands from foreign domination or foreign influence and grouping j
                        them round the holy banner of the Imam of Istamboul ? Our contemporary
                        declares that it sees no sign of agitation even among the most declared
                        Egyptian Nationalists. We differ, but instead of discussing a subject that
                        requires singularly cautious treatment we should like to ask our
                        contemporary what would be the political consequences to Egypt of the
                        occupation of the Sinai peninsula by Ottoman troops. Would the Opposition
                        maintain its absolute calm ? Would every malcontent retrain from the
                        temptation to demand or scheme for Ottoman support against the existing
                        order ? Would Egyptian prestige and the prestige of the Power that occupies
                        a peculiarly important position with regard to Egypt, be unabated by the
                        surrender ? Would the Bedouins, as inhabitants of the Sinai peninsula,
                        appreciate their new masters ? Above all, would the steady commercial
                        development of the country, a development fostered by the isolation and the
                        calm of Egypt, continue with Turkish troops encamped on the frontiers and
                        the country troubled by a haunting sense of military and political
                        insecurity ? Others may declare that the cession of Sinai would make no
                        difference to the tranquility aid prosperity of Egypt. We admire their
                        optimism. The eminent philosopher Pangloss must have founded a school in
                        Egypt during his varied and distressing Oriental experiences, and his
                        spiritual descendants,like their master, appear to enjoy rowing a Turkish
                        calque.</p>

                        withdrawing from Egyptian territory. The Malaooa will embark 3G0 men of the

                    <p>Ghazi Mukhtar Pacha has been very anxious about the removal of the boundary
                        pillars at El Areesh. The Ghazi wired to the Porte and has received the
                        following telegram in reply from The Grand Viz«er :— "It is impossible to
                        credit the news that the Ottoman troops have removed thS frontier pillars,
                        whereon the Khedive's name is engraved. Some other persons may have done so
                        to serve their own ends. The Government has ordered the Mutassarifiet of
                        Jerusalem to oped an enquiry into the question and to put back the pillars
                        in their proper place." This telegram was shown by the Pacha to the Khedive.
                        A telegram, published by "Al Lewa," states that The Ottoman troops are now
                        at the gates of El Areesh. </p>

                        Mokhtar Pacha's services in the Sinai Peninsula question, knd has refused to
                        listen to some jealous functionaries' advice, wishing to induce him to take
                        back again his splendid gift of No. 3 Palace. It is also stated that the
                        Sultan oannot understand the British pretensions on land belonging to the
                        Ottoman Empire.</p>
                    <p>Increase of the Garrleon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Morley's feelings must be of a sardonic character, says the "Pall Mali
                        Gazette," when, after so many sermons on the subjeot of evacuation, he finds
                        himself in a Government which is increasing The English garrison of Bgyp*.
                        The decision just announced * seems to be entailed at this junoture by * the
                        most elementary prudence. It was stated, in answer to a question in the
                        House of Commons some months ago, that the number of British troops in Egypt
                        was only 3,500, and if there have been any subsequent additions to their
                        strength, the fact has escaped our notice. At a time when the Egyptian
                        authorities are involved in friction with the bead of the Mohamedan world,
                        it is well that a Mohamedan soldiery should be "stiffened" with a morb
                        liberal baoking of British bayonets.</p>
                    <p>Then and Now.</p>
                    <p>It is worth recalling as a sample of the whirligig of politics that nearly
                        seventy years ago our Foreign Office was as much concerned in Protecting the
                        frontier of Turkey of against the pensions of the ruler of Egypt as it now
                        is in protecting the Egyptian fontier against the claims of the Sultan. The
                        problem was quite as difficult and then as now and Lord Palmerston The clear
                        that the only solution out of the difficulty was to make Mohammed Aly "With
                        draw into his original shell of Egypt." The cabinet was then convinced that
                        egypt's independence of the port would be most unwise and Lord Palmerston
                        wrote to Lord Granville in 1833. "We are prepared to give naval aid to the
                        Sulton against Mohamed Aly, if necessary and demanded; And we intend to
                        order our Mediterranean fleet immediately to Alexandria in order to get
                        Mohamed aly an outward and visible sign of war inward resolve.</p>
                    <p>Turkey a Cat's Paw.</p>
                    <p>The foreign office deserves no small credit, says the "Globe" for defying
                        radical wrath by deciding to augment the British garrison in Egypt. Were
                        there nothing more than the impudent Turkish intrusion in the
                        Sinaticpeninsula, a naval demonstration off the Ottoman littoral would
                        probably suffice to warn off Sultan Abdul Hamid from such dangerous
                        adventures. But the august inmate of Yildiz Kiosk is, in Con <cb n="4"
                        />tinental opinion, nothing more than the puppet of Germany: By methods and
                        means which can only be conjectured, German influ ence has latterly become
                        dominant at Constantinople, and it is an open secret on the Golden Horn that
                        'he Kaiser employs it for the farthe ranoe of diplcmstio intrigues, partly
                        direoted, as in the case of Morocoo, to weaken the Anglo Pronoh ent-nte. It
                        is not a olever policy on the part of &amp; tuonarch who aspires to a
                        ropntatiQd for omnisoience; the best that can he said for it is that it may
                        momentarily divert Teutonic thoughts from The growing isolation of the
                        Fatherland. That one palliation if the blander a till rests on chance, and
                        judging from the unea siness evinced by the leading journals at Ber tin, it
                        seems a safe conolasion that the average German does not in the least relish
                        the inter national beyoott ot his beloved country. In any case, our coarse
                        is so c'early traced that Sir E. Grey would have no excase were ho to turn
                        to the right or to the left even by a hair's breadth. With the consent of
                        oolleotive Europe, Great ^Britain has accepted responsibility for both the
                        safety and efficient administration of The Khedive's dominions. It is a
                        sacred trast, afijfthe Kaiser should know that its obligations will be
                        fulfilled as faithfully in the foture as has been the case ever since

                    <p>A crisis has taken place in the relations between the Armenian community and
                        the Council of that body in Alexandria. It appears that for some time back
                        the members of the community have been expressing their dissatisfaction with
                        The actions of the present CooDoil, of which Bartan Pacha is the president,
                        and agitating for the election of a new Council by popular vote.</p>
                    <p>The Archbishop, who had come down from Cairo a fortnight ago for the purpose
                        of settling the dispute, had to far been unsuccessful, and there was an
                        anticipation of some trouble at the church yesterday, which was not wholly
                        unjustified. At noon a deputation of Armenians waited on H.R the Governor at
                        the Goa-vernorat and set forth their grievances, as a result of which his
                        Excellency took immediate aation. Representatives of the Gouveinorat, headed
                        by Heddaya Bey, proceeded to the Armenian Church, and cealed The doors of
                        The sacred edifice, as well as thoee of the Armenian school and the bishop's
                        residence, afterwards handing over The keys to the representatives of the
                        people, who will see to the election of a new Counoil.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently a number of Armenians,beaded by the band of the community,
                        marched to the Gouvernorat and made a demonstration.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the Bishop is so prostrated at the tarn events have taken
                        that he is now in the European Hospital.</p>

                    <p>H.H. the Khedive left Cairo at 7.45 o'clock this morning for Alexandria.
                        Guards of honour chosen from the Egyptian Army and the Army of Occupation
                        were present at the station to pay the usual honours, and the Railway
                        Administration had taken great pains to decorate the interior and exterior
                        of the station buildings with excellent results. A great number of prominent
                        officials and notables, with many representatives of the Press, were
                        present, besides all the Ministers, the Advisers cud Under Secretaries of
                        State, heads of departments, etc.</p>
                    <p>His Highness arrived at the station from Koubbeh by special train shortly
                        after halfpast seven and immediately left the train, standing for some time
                        on The platform, conversing with the Ministers and Advisers, and many of the
                        notables present</p>
                    <p>The guards of honour were drawn up within the station, the Inniskillings on
                        one platform and the Egyptian troops on the other, and the Kbedivial salute
                        was given as his Highness entered and left the station, and a salute of 21
                        guns being fired from the Citadel as the train steamed out.</p>
                    <p>The Khadivial train arrived at the Mohar-rem Bey terminus punctually to the
                        minute at 11.30 o'clock, and a salute of 21 guns from Kom el Dik announced
                        the arrival of the train. The station had been very tastefully decorated in
                        honour of the occasion and there was a display of abruba and bunting. A
                        large and representative gathering of European and native notables were
                        assembled on the platform to greet his Highness,who on detraining. walked up
                        the platform, cordially shaking many of those present by the hand.</p>
                    <p>Oataide the station a guard of honour of Egyptian troops, compoeed of 100
                        non-commissioned officers and men, the battalion Colon r, and the In tan try
                        band, was paraded, and a similar guard of honour from the British garrison
                        was also paraded.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive, on leaving the station, inspected the two guards of honour and
                        then dro'e off to Ras el Tin Palace, escorted by his body goard. The streets
                        on The line of route to The Palace were gaily deoorated with flags and
                        bunting, and Cherif Pasha-street pre eented a most animated appearanoe.</p>
                    <p>While the Khedive was entering his oarriage on leaving the station a European
                        came up behind the carriage with his right hand buried in his breast
                        pceketThe suspicions of Benednoci Bey, Secretary to the Governor of
                        Alexandria, were aroosed as he thooght the man was about to draw a weapon.
                        The Bey se'zed his hand and found it contained a petition. Hehsnded the man
                        over to the police. The petition was consigned to an officer of the
                        Khedive's snife.</p>
                    <p>The ships in harboor were dressed, as also were the signalling station and
                        The lighthouse.</p>
                    <p>On his Highness reaching Ras el-Tin Palace, a salute of 21 gone was fired by
                        both Fort Saleh and the American cruiser Tacoma.</p>
                    <p>His Highness's reception, the last of the season, at Abdeen Palace on
                        Saturday was largely attended, native and European notables alike being well
                        represented. The Khedive, who seemed in good health, conversed for seme time
                        with the Govornor of the National Bank of Egypt, who sat next to the throne
                        chair.</p>
                    <p>His Highness will in all probability remain for a month at Alexandria.</p>

                        chequered and adventurous life in South Africa and Abyssinia. His pen was
                        forcible and vigorous, his criticism always personal and often witty, and
                        his knowledge of men and things was extensive and peculiar. He died at the
                        age of 56 and was buried in the old cemetery at Old Cairo on Saturday. We

                        short but very fiery career. He was also conneoted with Abyssinian polities
                        and occupied a high position in the army of the Negus at one time, and was
                        one of the few British subjects who suoneeded io making themselves the

                    <head>L'UNION FONCIERE D'EGYPTE<lb/>PROGRESS OF THE COMPANY.</head>
                    <p>We recently re recived an enquiry from London as to the position of the Union
                        Fon-eiere d'Egypte, and the following statement as to the progress of the
                        company has been com piled. The doings of the company are remarkably little
                        known, even at Alexandria, and this account therefore should be of interest
                        to all those who are on tho kok-oot for a safe investment, as is evident
                        from the following summary of its operations.</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the company's career (it was only formed last Jane),an
                        ostate of two thoasand feddans was bought. The price paid was LB. 50 per
                        fsddan. The company has since then considerably improved The land and has
                        already been offered L.B. 85 per feddan for the property. Bat it is hoped
                        that far higher prioes will be realised and the company reoently sold
                        sixteen feddans of this land at L.R lGO. This is a good example of the
                        operations of the company, all of whose real propery purchases-have been
                        characterised by foresight</p>
                    <p>The Union Fonciere has taken over 7,000 feddans from the Behera Company.
                        Every year the latter company reclaims large arees of uncultivated land, bat
                        has no time to devote to completing the caltivation of the soil. This
                        development work is undertaken by the Union Foncire, which has solectcd from
                        among the Behera estates nearly seven thousand feddans at a price averagii g
                        LE 36 per feddan. This property has been oarefnlly selected at ohoice sites,
                        and it is fully expected that it will bt> eventually sold at L E.80 per
                        feddan.</p>
                    <p>The third operation made by the Union was The purchase of an estate of aboot
                        six hundred feddans, situated near one of the plots bought from tha Behora
                        Company. The contiguity of the new purchase has greatly benefited the latter
                        plots owing to the facilities for irrigation that have ensued.</p>
                    <p>The total ooet of the company's purchases up to date amounts to about L.E.
                        400,000. If the ostates thus purchased were told dow a nett profit of L.E.
                        160,000 could easily be realised.</p>
                    <p>The balance (LK ICO,COO) of the oapital remaining is to be laid ont on the
                        purchase of building lands, and at the present time some big sales are being
                        negotiated at Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The company's business is being administered mosteoononiioally.lt is
                        entrusted to capable natives, who, it is interesting to note, have turned
                        ont to be most nsefal employer. They keep in touch with the Moudirieh
                        authorities and .other proviooial ooUbilities far better than Europeans
                        wonld and they have been foned to be very serviceable in making bargains
                        with qatives.</p>
                    <p>The company's lands are aitoated in seven or eight different places, all in
                        the Qharbieh province, which is the most populous moddirieh in Egypt</p>
                    <p>The foregoing facts show that the company is in a highly satisfactory state.
                        It is under the management of M. Leopold Jollies, whose reputation as an
                        expert in land is well known.</p>
                    <p>The Union Fonciere d'Egypte received the Khedivial sanction on the 6th Jane
                        hat and op to the present The company has received little attention from the

                    <head>GRANDS GARAGES D'EGYPTE</head>
                    <p>C'est demain que doit avoir lien l'émission de la Société Anonyme des Grands
                        Garages d'Egypte, société qui a été autorisée par Déoret Khédivial en date
                        da 23 Avril courant, et dont les fondateurs sont M M J.W. Williamson, Allan
                        Joseph, Alfred G. Curphey, P.W. Stout, E.C. Hogg, Alex. Comanos et Georges
                        Merzbach.</p>
                    <p>Le premier conseil d'administration des Grands Garages est composé de MM. J.
                        W. Williamson, Allan F. Joseph, Pierre de Bois-sien et Angaste Faget.</p>
                    <p>Le but de la Société est la reprise à la société Anonyme Egyptienne
                        d'électricité de son garage situé an Caire, quartier Marouf, y compris
                        toutes les installations, stocks, etc, ainsi que les agences des Maisons
                        qu'elle représente, notamment celles de la Compagnie parisienne des Voitures
                        Eleotriques (Krieger) et de la Compagnie Richard Brasier, dont la renommée
                        est universelle.</p>
                    <p>Cotre la vente des voitures, qui de jour en jour prend une grande extension,
                        la Société tirera évidemment de gros revenus de la location ; le genre
                        d'affaire qui n'a été fait jasqu'ici que par des particuliers ne disposant
                        généralement que de moyens limités, a donné des résultats absolument
                        inattendus ; on peut donc s'attendre à voir la Société qui aura à sa
                        disposition des capitanx considérables, en tirer des bénéfices
                        partioalièrement importants.</p>
                    <p>La Société compte établir également un second garage au Caire, dans l'ile de
                        Ghézireh, et un autre à Alexandrie. Elle pourra, bien entendu, en installer
                        d'autres partout où elle jugera utile et avantageux de le faire.</p>
                    <p>De plus, une école de chauffeurs sera très probablement ouverte, ce qui
                        viendra combler une lacune ; en effet, il n'est guère pratique de faire
                        venir, à grands frais, des mécinioiens d'Europe, alors que sous la conduite
                        de bons professeurs, nombre d'indigènes ou d'européens dp pays, deviendront
                        de parfaits chauffeurs ; ceux-ci trouveront ainsi des emplois rémunérateurs,
                        tout en faisant réaliser aux propriétaires de voitures une sériease
                        économie.</p>
                    <p>Etant donné le développement considérable qu'a pris l'automobilisme en
                        Egypte, il n'est pas difficile de prévoir le vaste champ d'opération qu'a
                        devant elle une exploitation telle que celle de la Société des Grands
                        Garages.</p>
                    <p>La Société est constitué a au capital de L E. 80,000 divisé en 20 000 actions
                        de L. E. 4 chacune, sur lesquelles la moitié seulement, soit 10.000 actions
                        sont offertes au public. La souscription ne sera ouverte que demain, à
                        l'Anglo Egyptian Bank au Caire et à Alexandrie. P. T. 50 sont payables à la
                        souscription, et P. T. 50 à la répartition. Pour chaque 10 actions, il sera
                        alloué une part de fondateur.</p>
                    <p>Les souscriptions seront reçues, tant au Caire qu'à Alexandrie, aux guichets
                        de l'Anglo Egyptian Bank. Nous publions d'autre part le prospeotus
                        d'émission.</p>

                        Société Anonyme ou capital de L. E. 160000 divisé en 40000 actions
                        ordinaires de L. E. 4 chacune. Sur celles-ci, 14000 actions seront offertes
                        à la souscription publique, le Mercredi 2 Mai, aux guichets de l'Anglo
                        Egyptian Bank au prix de L. E 4 1/4.</p>
                    <p>Le Champ d'action de la Société est des plus grands. Elle pourra acheter,
                        vendre ou prendre à bail tous immeubles, les mettre en valeur, y édifier des
                        constructions, les revendre au comptant ou à terme, les louer, etc.; elle
                        pourra également s'occuper de toutes entreprises de travaux publics ou
                        privés. La Société est déja propriétaire, entre le pont de Ghamrah et
                        Demerdache, d'une vaste étendue de terrain au milieu de laquelle sera
                        établie une gare do nouveau chemin de fer de la Cairo Electric Railways and
                        Oases Cy. qui y amènera les voyageurs du pont Limoun en moins de 5
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>Mais nous croyons savoir que, loin de s'en tenir à ce seul domaine, la
                        Société a en vae d'autres affaires similaires, et qu'elle compte bénéficier,
                        dans une très large proportion, du développement économique du pays. Il est
                        facile de se rendre compte que, bien que son activité doive se limiter au
                        Caire et à sa banlieue, l'extension extraordinaire que prend la Capitale, la
                        construction de quartiers nouveaux, l'avantage considérable qu'il y a à
                        acheter des terrains en gros pour les lotir, tout cela suffira à lui assurer
                        un vaste champ de travail.</p>
                    <p>Le Conseil d'Administration de la nouvelle Société est composé d'hommes
                        compétents et pratiques, qui, tant par leur connaissance approfondie du pays

                    <head>THE ETHIOPIAN RAILWAY AND THE POWERS.*</head>
                    <p>Before the railway, the trade between Abyssinia and the coast was mostly
                        carried by caravan to the port of Zeila in British Somali-land. In all
                        probability, when once the railway was working it would acquire most of the
                        traffic, but this was not good enough for the French Minister, and he got
                        Menelik to give orders that all merchandise leaving Harrar or coming there
                        from the coast should be carried exclusively by the railway, thus diverting
                        the whole of the trade from the British port. The concessionaries thus
                        started under very good auspices, but they found the difficulty of obtaining
                        their capital in Paris greater than they expected, and it was not until 1897
                        that some French banks took a considerable amount of their shares and bonds,
                        and the French Government agreed to collect at Djibouti a 10 per cent. duty
                        on the goods to be transported by the railway. The work was also begun in
                        1897, and such an enterprise naturally attracted great attention in French
                        colonial circles ; it was pointed out that Abyssinia was a country of vast
                        resources, both mineral and agricultural, and that the railway monopoly in
                        French hands would open an immense field for French capital and a certain
                        amount of political control. that Djibouti might not unreasonably be
                        expected to supplant Aden, as the principal port of call for Far Eastern
                        trade ; it was not enough to say how good it would be for French trade, but
                        a great point was made of the way in which British trade was to suffer.
                        These favoured circumstances brought for a time great prosperity to
                        Djibouti, and much capital was Spent there in view of its magnificent future
                        prospects ; the town increased by leaps and bounds ; but as years went on
                        and the railway works progressed it began to be seen, as is usual in such
                        cases, that the difficulties of the task had been underrated ; the estimated
                        cost had been largely exceeded ; the tribesmen, who saw in perspective the
                        destruction of their carrying trade, gave trouble, they not only attacked
                        working parties, but at one time threatened even Djibouti itself; the
                        company and their contractors quarrelled, the latter had probably not
                        undertaken to wage war; the funds waned to a low ebb, and attempts to
                        replenish them in France met with scant success. Although endeavours were
                        made to excite patriotic emotions, on the grounds of political influence,
                        they did not materialize in the form of financial assistance, and although
                        the directors were all Frenchmen, they found themselves compelled to look
                        elsewhere for support.</p>
                    <p>It was only from a speech delivered in 1900, by the chairman of the New
                        African Company, that the public was first informed that British capital had
                        become interested in this railway. He no doubt wished to justify his policy
                        and that of his colleagues by saying all that he could in favour of it, but
                        it sounds rather like faint praise when he feels obliged to qualify bis
                        hopes that the business will be profitable, by saying that it is "subject to
                        the vicissitudes in new railway undertakings of this nature,'' At all events
                        the New African Company advanced a large sum of money to the railway
                        company, and it may be news to some of oar readers to hear that this was
                        followed by another amount advanced by the New Egyptian Company. Most of ns
                        thought that the shareholders of Egyptian companies invested their capital
                        in this country, but it appears that is only an old fashioned idea, — it is
                        now used "orbi et urbi" ; if Egypt is too small for them, would it not be
                        better to take a more ambitions name ?</p>
                    <p>A year later — in 1901—it was officially announced that three British
                        companies had considerably extended their interest in the railway, but for
                        some time an uneasy feeling had been growing in French colonial circles,
                        that the increase of British capital might in-teifere with the exclusively
                        French character of the enterprise ; a violent outcry was raised to the
                        effect that French interests were betrayed, and that once more rapacious
                        England was seeking to supplant France. Nothing was said about the
                        co-operation of British capital, having being invited when both the French
                        investor and his Government bad declined to copie to the rescue, and the
                        whole enterprise was on the point of collapse.</p>
                    <p>After many efforts, in which no attempt was made to conceal their ultimate
                        object, the French Colonial party succeeded in obtaining the assistance of
                        the Government in 1903, but this result was not arrived at until an
                        arrangement had been made which entirely changed the whole character of the
                        enterprise, from a commercial to a political undertaking, The authors
                        description of this phase of the business is most interesting, and it is
                        simply astounding to find that in all the long negotiations which led up to
                        it the French Government and the company made the unpardonable blunder of
                        not consulting Menelik at all in the matter, although he was admittedly an
                        independ(nt Sovereign whose rights the French Government were taking from a
                        com- <cb n="2"/>pany which had no such rights to concede. However well
                        pleased the French Government might have been with this arrangement, we
                        think that on reflection the directors of the company could have had but
                        little reason to be thankful ; they were tied hand and foot ; they could not
                        even appoint their own manager or local representatives without the consent
                        of a French Minister, and the latter could at any time demand their
                        resignation. We only quote one of a series of vexations regulations, which
                        appear sufficient to make life unbearable and progress almost
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>However anxious the Emperor Menelik was to see the railway finished, it was
                        too much to expect that a man of his intelligence, character, and position
                        was going to put up with this sort of neglect, without having some thing to
                        say about it. Menelik has in recent times acquired, not at little cost, a
                        much wider outlook, and a deeper insight into international relations, than
                        he formerly possessed ; a long series of events had not passed unobserved by
                        him, the author refers to many of them at some length, but we will only
                        mention one or two, which certainly produced some effect on the mind of the
                        Emperor. He had listened to the proposals of the French Minister that he
                        should co-operate with France in ambitions schemes on the Upper Nile Valley
                        ; Kitchener's decisive victory at Omdurman and the withdrawal of French
                        troops from Fashoda were in violent contradiction with the probabilities he
                        had been led to believe. The frequent observations in the French Press to
                        the effect that Abyssinia might become "a sort of colony" of France did not
                        pass unnoticed, not could their effect have been a pleasing one on Menelik.
                        At all events, in 1903, when the text of the Convention was published,
                        Menelik declared to the French Minister that its terms filled him with
                        astonishment and indignation, and M. Lagarde's request that he should assent
                        to it met with a fiat refusal; he said that he considered some of its
                        clauses as a direct infringement of his rights as an independent sovereign,
                        and that they unmasked a design of territorial aggrandisement with which he
                        had been unwilling to credit France.</p>
                    <p>It is not very astonishing that French influence at Adis Abeba fell to
                        something below zero. Meanwhile, the railway company, with the funds raised
                        on the security of the French Government, had paid off the loans contracted
                        with the British companies, and had gone on with the construction of the
                        line, which was completed as far as Dire Daona, a distance of about 195
                        miles from Djibouti, in December 1902. Great preparations were made for the
                        inauguration, and it was announced that Menelik would be present, bat much
                        to the disappointment of the officials, he did not attend, although it must
                        have been no slight disappointment to have kept away, as he had frequently
                        expressed his strong desire to see the railway and the sea.</p>
                    <p>New difficulties soon arose, the principal one being Menelik's refusal to
                        give the necessary permission for the continuation of the railway, which he
                        said he could not allow to be built by a company controlled by a foreign
                        Government. This put the company in a very awkward position, their funds
                        were again almost exhausted, the receipts of the line were insufficient to
                        meet its working expenses, interest on lands, etc. A fresh attempt was made
                        to induce the French Government to again come to the rescue of this never
                        so-called national enterprise, but in vain. The company, in its extremity,
                        was again compelled to have recourse to the British group. Long negotiations
                        followed which are difficult to trace, but in December, 1901, the Earl of
                        Cheserfield, as Chairman of the International Trust Company. in his speech
                        to his shareholders.</p>
                    <p>mentions them at some length, still only in such terms as to show that up to
                        that time no understanding had been arrived at.</p>
                    <p>Early in 1905 the matter was again brought to the serious attention of the
                        French Government without much result beyond a suggestion that the "entente
                        cordiale" should be brought to bear on it, although, so far as we know, that
                        "entente" had nothing to do with Abyssinia, except perhaps on the principle
                        that "any stick is good enough to beat a dog with." (To be continued).</p>

                    <head>PROSPECTUS</head>
                    <p>The Company has been formed for the purpose of acquiring, under exceptionally
                        favourable terms and conditions, certain lands situated between the Pont de
                        Ghamrah and Demerdache Railway Station (Egyptian State Railways) which will
                        be brought to within five minutes of the heart of Cairo by the construction
                        at a central point on the Company's Estate of a Station which will be the
                        stopping point on the Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oasis Coy's
                        Line between Font Limoun and the Oasis of Abbassieh.</p>
                    <p>Other equally—if not more important advantages will accrue to the Lands now
                        acquired, by reason of the probable immediate constrnotion of important
                        thoroughfares passing through the Estate, and joining the Boulevard Abbas,
                        the widening of which is now in active progress, whilst the projected new
                        Avenue to the Palais de Konbbeh will entail the construction of an imposing
                        "passage" at the Font de Gamrah thus bringing that part of the lands
                        purchased situated on the left side of the Matarieh Railway to a point of
                        value almost on a par with the rest of the Estate.</p>
                    <p>With such physical advantages as those mentioned, in addition to the
                        favourable position occupied by the Estate, it does not require the
                        knowledge of an expert to see that the realisation of it in conveniently
                        sized lots at much enhanced prices will be a matter of comparative ease,
                        particularly in the hands of those immediately connected with the Company,
                        whose experience in this class of business is well-known.</p>
