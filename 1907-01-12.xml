                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>FRANCE IN THE LEVANT.</head>
                    <p>M. Chariot's attacks on French congregational education in the Near East have
                        brought forth a well-considered and, we judge, well-merited refutation in a
                        letter published by a Parisian journal, and which our contemporary the
                        "Pyramides" re-prints at length. Without entering the arena of polemics
                        which are not ours , to v-age, there are in this letter several very sound
                        arguments that we feel it our duty to point out as a warning to a friendly
                        Power. Foremost is the loss that France suffers by departing from the line
                        of policy embodied in that famous dictum of Gambetta</p>
                    <p>'L'anticléricalisme n'est pas un article d'exportation." In so doing the
                        Republic has ruined the splendid hegemony that Saint Louis bequeathed to the
                        nation. She can no longer dictate to Turkey as the executor of Roman
                        Qetholioism ; that prestige she has shattered by a too radical policy. Till
                        the split with Rome, the name of "Frank" was identified, if not</p>
                    <p>identified, if not confounded by Turkish officialdom, with that of France.
                        Now that the Republic shows signs of anti-clericalism there also, the
                        numerous Christian communities who, subject to the Sultan, enjoyed nearly as
                        many privileges as free-born Republican*, will be without such
                        guarantee.</p>
                    <p>To come now to M. Chariot and his report. As the envoy of the French Foreign
                        Office, his statements have led to the withdrawal from St. Benoît College at
                        Çmyraa of twenty out of forty Turkish students whose -parents were alarmed
                        at the allegations made therein. Father Gressien, rector of the University
                        of Boy rout, considers, and rightly, the assertions of the Commissioner as
                        likely to have serious consequences to French interests in the Orient, and
                        the rector has met the charge of proselytism levelled against the scholastic
                        friars by referring him to the Encyclical of Leo XIII., entitled Orientalism
                        dignita»,</p>
                    <p>Crispi was in power, and after imposing on a none too elutic budget an annual
                        burthen of 1,500,000 francs, she gave up the effort, and wisely submitted
                        her educational interests to the I-atin congregations. Up till now, tbe
                        selfsupporting scholastic institutions cost the French Treasury no more than
                        600,000 franca a year. What France is to-day so imprudently casting from her
                        is an object which mo;e than one Roman Catholic Power has coveted. Austria
                        sought it in 1870, and was much put out at being denied by Franoe. It was
                        the goal of Bismarck's Near Eastern p*> licy, and he was no superficial
                        student of Oriental politics. To-day the Kaiser, head of eighteen million
                        Catholics, is watching the course of events which may one day lead him to a
                        coup cFftat to which his landing at Tangier would be insignificant. What
                        France abandons thus thoughtlessly, is what Russia aspires to secure for the
                        furtherance of Pan-Slavism in the Near East : the protection of Orthodox
                        Christians.. Christianity, whatever its form, needs the support of a
                        European Power in Turkey, and that Power is the master of the situation.</p>

                            often lies with the snbBoribero, without whose intelligent oooperation

                                policy meant the solution of the labour question and bread for
                                millions by the employment of German oapital in trade. The indnstry
                                and navigation of the world, he said, was rapidly becoming British.
                                Germany was losing her importance owing to lack of oolonice, the way
                                the ^British colonies were assimilating foreign immigrants and the

                    <p>"A British Agent in JJgypt" writes to "African Engineering" : —</p>
                    <p>I eh mid like to oorreot an impression whioh statement made by yonr Cairo
                        correspondent in a recent issna of "African Engineering" may have created.
                        He leads one to believe that German engineering firms insist on cash payment
                        g fqr their Bgyptiap orders. In the instance to whioh yonr correspondent
                        refers this may have been true, but it is far from being the general role,
                        as he seems to imply. My own e;perienge is tb%t one of the chiet deterrents
                        to British trade in Egypt is the more exaoting demands of onr home firms in
                        the way of payments. One company to whom I applied for a quota tion for
                        several steam wagons insisted that the whole amount of the order should be
                        paid before the vohioles left the works. In other words, they wanted me to
                        fioanQe their business. This is not an isolated instanoe. Of course,
                        snchabsurd terms are quite unacceptable when it is borne in mind that an
                        agent is often expected to wait months for the greater portion of his money.
                        On the other hand, the olftnse in German tender conpernijig payments
                        generally stipulates that one quarter shall be paid on reoeipt of the order,
                        one quarter on delivery, one quarter at the end of si; months, and the
                        remainder within twelve months ot delivery. I need not dilate on the
                        advantage to the purchaser offered by these terms, {t may, however, interest
                        youy readers to bear that since I have induced several of my firms (all
                        British) to adopt a similar policy I have been able to send thorn several
                        good orders for machinery. Certainly, there is a Continental firm here—not a
                        German fi&lt;m—who sometimes aek for cash ; but this is quite an exceptional
                        cas?. That particular fiim have been so successful, diplo matioal!yr in

                    <head>THE LIVER AND STQMACH-<lb/>FACTS YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.</head>
                    <p>The liver and stomach, work harmoniously together, to chauge the food we eat
                        into blood, bone, and tisane. The stomach sup plies the gastri j iice which
                        digests the albuminous part of our food, and the bile from the liver
                        completes the process of digestion by aoting on the oils and fats. The
                        digested food is theD ready for conversion into pore, rich blood.
                        Wheo,however,the stomaoh and liver are oat of ordsr, there is not enough
                        gastric juice and bile formed to completely digest the food and form new
                        blood, and the undigested food wearies aod irritates tbadelioate mechanism,
                        and dogs the bowels. Doan's Dinner Pills stimulate the flow of gastrio juice
                        and bile, thas directly aiding digestion and helping in the making of new,
                        life-giving blood. This medicine should be used by all who have such
                        symptoms of liver and stomach complaints as these*:—</p>
                    <p>Feeling of fulness, drowsiness and heaviness after meals ; stomach pains ;
                        yellowness of the whites of the eyes ; heartburn ; indigestion ; spots
                        before the eyes ; constipation ; vomiting; changeable appetite ; melaooholy
                        feeling ; diffi- onlty in breathing ; tight feeling aoross the chest ;
                        headache ; bad taste in the month. Doan's Dinner Pills are reliable, and

                    <head>PROSPECTUS.</head>
                    <p>THE COMPANY has been formed for the pnrpoaes stated in the Memorandum of
                        Association, and more particularly to establish a line of British steamships
                        to supply the demand made by the increasing passenger traffi 3 tor a first
                        class and rapid eervica between Enrope and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Limited, of Glasgow, has
                        contracted with the Company for the construction of two turbine steamers of
                        aboot 18,000 tons gros» register, the length of the vessols to be 550 feet
                        and breadth 60 feet. The steamers will each'have five turbines, viz:—three
                        turbines for going ahead and two for going astern. They will each have three
                        propellers and («wording to specifiation) are to steam not less than 20 A
                        knots an hoar, at which speed the passage between Marseilles and Alexandria
                        should be accomplished in 70 b >ars. Accommodation will be provided for 500
                        first class and 280 second class passengers.</p>
                    <p>In preparing the specific ition for thêta steamers, the Directors have had in
                        view the recent great ad vaines that bava been myie in tb§ fitting of
                        steameTa with the object of increasing the comfort of pMsengers. Besides
                        state-room aroômmodation 'of the most up to- date character, a number of
                        "cabinets de luxe," each with private bath room, etc., adj lining, will be
                        provided, and in addition to the nsaal pnblio rooms there will be on the
                        upper deck a restaurant (having separate kitch ins and service) in which
                        meals will.be served at all b >ors à la carte.</p>
                    <p>In view of the ports, Marseilles and Alex andria, at which the steamers wi 1
                        call, special attention has been paid to ventilatiQp ; this will be effected
                        by the tbermotank system by which the air in every part of the ships will be
                        febaoged six time* an boar.</p>
                    <p>Other features will be as children's sa'o n and passenger hit comm-inicatlng
                        with the varioos passenger deck».</p>
                    <p>I, will be seen that the Company's steam rs frill reproduce all the mos t
                        Rtnkiof features</p>
                    <p>? the newest Atlantic lioera and as regarda comfort and apeed, will surpass
                        anything hitherto attempted by any lines running be- •tween Earops and
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer'« R'port of the 8th March, 1906, containa the following reference
                        with regard to the passenger traffi j with Earope;— " 1 have allnded in my
                        resent Annual " Reports to the enormous increase which " has taken place
                        during the last few years "in the passenger traffi> between Egypt " add
                        Europe. In 1902, 60.000, and in 1903, " 74,000 passengers disembarked at
                        Port "Said and Alexandria. Ii 1904 the total " number was 90,400. In 1905 it

                    <p>The Directors believe that the special facilities which the Company's service
                        will provide will appeal to the largely inoreaaiDg travelling ptfblio and
                        will also prove highly remunerative.</p>
