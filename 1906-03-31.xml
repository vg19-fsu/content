                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                    <head>ABYSSINIA.</head>
                    <p>A special telegram which we published in our last issue announced that an
                        agitation had arisen in Abyssinia on the death of Ras Makonnen, the
                        presumptive successor to the Emperor Menelik. But there is no apparent
                        reason why the Emperor should not continue for many years to come to rule
                        the destinies of the Empire which he has done so much to consolidate and
                        extend. There are few more interesting figures in Africa at this moment than
                        the Emperor has succeded in welding the subordinate kinngdoms under his rule
                        into a fairly homogenous State, and in obtaining the recognition of its
                        independence by the European Powers who are its immediate neighbours. But
                        time is required to give permanency to his work and the problem with which
                        the Emperor Menelik is faced is all the more difficult because there is no
                        direct heir to his throne and that the presumed successor has just died. In
                        these circumstances it is perhaps inevitable that there should be intriguing
                        among the ambitious Rases, some of whom, it is believed, have not been
                        disinclined to coquette with the representatives of the European Powers at
                        Adis Abeba. But so long as Abyssinia remains united no single European Power
                        could conquer the country; while it would prove a difficult and costly
                        buisness for Great Britian, France and Italy combined to overcome the
                        resistance which the Abyssinians could offer. But the real difficulty in
                        Abyssinia is Germany, for it is rumoured that Kaiser's Moracco policy is to
                        be repeated in that quarter of the world. It is currently reported on the
                        Continent that he purposses to enter a siplomatic protest against the treaty
                        now being arranged between the Negus on the one part, and the British,
                        French and Italian Governments on the other. This compact does not infringe
                        in the slightest degree on any German interests in Abyssinia, shadowy as
                        they are; traders of that nationally will be as free to carry on commercial
                        buisness as those of the signatory Powers. The main purpose of the
                        arrangement is to shut out foreign politicial intrigue by a self-denying
                        ordance between the three European Powers which have secured a solid footing
                        in Menelik's domininons. For a considerable time he has been patiently but
                        firmly striving for that object, and the treaty represents the outcome of
                        his statemanship. Practically, it amounts to the neutralisation of
                        Abyssinia, both politically and commercially, the guarentors being the three
                        Powers most closely concerned in its peaceful development. It is absurd,
                        therefore, for Germany to question their right to come to an agreement
                        which, so far from injuring whatever trading interests the Kaiser imagines
                        to exist, must benefit them in common with those of all other foreign
                        nations. </p>

                        new colours to you here today, on my way borne from India. It was in that
                        country that your battalion was first raised in 1858* where it saw most of
                        its active service. These colours bear the nsmes of the campaigns and
                        battles iu which the regiment has taken part. They are rightly venerated as
                        the emblem of the gallant deeds of thosu who • erved and of those who have
                        died for their country. I feel sure that the colours will te an incentive to
                        all ranks to maintain the great traditions of the regiment and to add fresh
                        honours to its records. In handing the oolours to you 1 am confident that
                        they will be safe in your keeping."</p>

                        unsuitable for treatment in hospital. The subscriptions received in 1905,
                        which may be taken as an average year, amounted tu £22.0-7 ½ d. It the
                        present scheme is carried into effeot it will necessitate an extra annual
                        expenditure of £100 or £120. Thus in order to maintain a nurse and carry on

                        <p>Last night Port Said streets were quite deserted. All day it had been
                            exceptionally hot and damp ; in fact, it was by far the worst day we
                            have had this year. In the evening the wind sprang up and long before
                            midnight it was blowing a gale. All the ships in the Casai, 17 in
                            number, were obliged to tie up, being unable to proceed. Bad weather is
                            also reported from outside, several Ships being overdue. There has been
                            a steady wind blowing all day, and early this evening it started to rain
                            heavily, with the result that the whole town ia nearly under water. It
                            is a wonder that some steps are not taken to put things In a somewhat
                            more satisfactory state, as the present system of drainage, if there is
                            any, is a disgrace to the town.</p>

                            unable to get her off, and on their return to Port Said it was found
                            necessary to send more tags with fighters down, and they started to
                            discharge the cargo immediately. Finally she was refloated at midnight
                            after having discharged most of her cargo. Traffic has been stopped all

                    <p>The Ministry of the Interior has under consideration a scheme for the
                        employment of motor omnibuses in Alexandria an its suburbs in connection
                        with the tramway system of the Alexandria Tramway Company. The Alexandria
                        Municipality has alresdy informed the Tramway Company that it has no
                        objection to the employment of motor omnibuses by the company.</p>
                    <p>The company, on receipt of the Ministry's approbation, will start motor
                        omnibases with seating accommodation for twenty persons in each 'bus. The
                        'buses will be fitted with first and second-class accommidation end will run
                        in connection with the company's network of tramways, thus affording an easy
                        and rapid system of intercommunication with all parts of the city.</p>

                    <head>WHEAT IN THE SUDAN</head>
                    <p>Several Egyptian landowners who visited the Sudan this winter are of opinion,
                        says the "Sudan Times," that the country is admirably saited for wheat
                        growing. lt is maintained by one of them that the net profit on the yield of
                        a feddan cannot fall below P.T. 200. This he says may be less than the
                        profit realized from cotton, but it should be borne in mind that so long as
                        the labour in the Sudan are limited only small a be placed nnder cotton
                        cultivation. It is easier to teach the natives to grow wheat than cotton;
                        besides, the first does not require so many hands as the latter. The yield
                        per feddan of wheat should average five ardebs.</p>
