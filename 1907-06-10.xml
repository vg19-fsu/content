                    <head>INDIAN UNREST.</head>
                    <p>The news from India for some weeks past has been read by those who take an
                        interest in the welfare of that country with mingled feelings. It is
                        distressing to observe that a part of the result of the policy which lias
                        tried to give Western instruction to all who were willing te receive it, has
                        been to create a class of writers and speakers Whose one aim is to overthrow
                        the Government that has made their existence possible. It is distressing
                        also to see that the class of writers and speakers just described have
                        attained to a considerable influence aver a portion of the Hindu population.
                        On the other had, there is some satisfaction to be derived from the fact
                        that the Indian Government has not by the knowledge that these conditions
                        exist been scared into any hurried departure from its ideals or from its
                        methods of government, and that even when the preachers of anarchical
                        doctrines have led their hearers into excess there has been no rush into
                        repression, but only a moderate and sparing use of powers, which the
                        Government has long possessed but rarely used, of removing to safe places
                        the inciters to disorder. The recent steps taken by the Indian Government,
                        happily with the entire concurrence of the Government at home, have had
                        perhaps a more salutary effect than might have been produced by <cb n="6"/>a
                        wholesale display of force or by a severe course of repression. The campaign
                        of mispresentation and invective, accompanied by demonstrations of
                        disloyalty and attempts at terrorism, together with the organis ed boyeott,
                        whieh began in Bengal has made its way into the Punjab, to the great disgust
                        of the loyal Mohammeddans. The removal of a few leaders to distant places of
                        seclusion has had a quieting effect and the deportation of another agitator
                        from Amritsar, announced last week, will help to convince the others that
                        their occupation is not for ever to be tolerated. The Circular sent by the
                        Indian Government to local Governments pointing out the messures that may
                        feasonably be taken to, prevent schools and colleges from being nurseries of
                        sedition seems also to be a step in the direction of the restoration of
                        tranquility. Very welcome, too, is the resolution reported this morning
                        empowering local Governmerits to pro: secute newspapers that, publish
                        articles inciting to disturbance. The natural tendency of observers at home
                        in presence of sedition in India is to urge the Indian Government to put it
                        down with a strong hand. That is a tendency to which we do not wish to
                        yield. The Indian Government is better informed than any observers hire, and
                        is mote keenly aware of the possible consequence of its action than can be
                        any critics in this country. It is not only informed but responsible.
                        Accordingly the duty of good citizens in this country is to uphold the
                        Indian Government in every possibie way, even to the extent of remembering
                        that every human Government is liable to make mistakes and therefore of
                        abstaining from microsdopic criticism of its action.</p>
                    <p>One of the chief difficulties of any Government, which like that of Great
                        Britain is organised upon democratic principles in so far that it is
                        responsible to a Parliament, is that in dealing with the affairs of distant
                        countries, specially of countries of different society and speech from our
                        own, there is always the possibility of criticisms made upon it in the
                        ordinary course of Parliamentary life being misinterpreted at the other end
                        of the tele graph wire. If one party is in office, and the other party,
                        being in opposition, discusses freely the executive or other acts of the
                        Government, persons at a distance may infer that this country is divided and
                        therefore has no strong will. Such an impression, if it should be produced
                        or encouraged in India just now, would be most unfortunate. We venture to
                        hope that it will not be produced. It is fortunate that the Viceroy of India
                        appointed by the late Government has the confidence of their successors. It
                        is fortunate that the responsibility to Parliament for the government of
                        India is in the hands of Mr Morley, in whose character and ability both
                        parties have complete confidence. There are, of course, many who do not
                        agree with some of Mr. Morley's political theories, theories which we have
                        often had occasion to criticise. But Mr. Morley is a worker, a great
                        student, an administrator of more than ordinary power. There is no fear in
                        his case of a failure to grasp the nature of a situation, or of a weakness
                        in decision or in tenacity of purpose. His conduet and that of the
                        Government of India in dealing with the agitation and the disturbanees in
                        India will hardly bo the subject of criticism from the Opposition. It would,
                        we venture to think, be a misfortune if any embarrassement were caused him
                        by lack of sympathy from among those who are as a rule the supporters of the
                        present Government.</p>
                    <p>The doctrine now taught by some of those Hindus who a few years ago were
                        represented as the advocates of the gradual introduction of representative
                        methods and a constitutional system into India, is that of overthrow of the
                        British Government as soon as possible, by the plan of passive resistance
                        and of a strike of all natives in Government employ, and if that fails then
                        by conflict. While such a theory is preached in India it appears to us that
                        no Englishman, whatever his theory of Government may be, can without
                        injuring his country and India; express sympathy with any form of Indian
                        propaganda. In doing so he would be playing with fire. In India it is the
                        class that has had the benefit of European instruction that expresses
                        extreme doctrines, and observers in England should bear in mind that these
                        doctrines are preached to people unaccustomed to political debate and still
                        more to that political action which is part of the daily life of the people
                        of this country. Those who would support the Indian Government in measures
                        for restricting the liberty of the Indian Press to spread denunciations of
                        the British administration do so on the ground that the conditions of India
                        are not those of England. Here there are always newspapers on both sides.
                        There is no danger of the cause of law having no exponents. But in India the
                        case is very different. Of those who have had a literary training perhaps
                        the pick are in Government employ or in such other employment as is not
                        consistent with their being journalists. But those whose literary
                        instruction has not opened for them a career in the public service are
                        exposed to the temptation, not always resisted, of seeking influence and
                        notoriety by attacks on the Government. In a country where instruction, even
                        after many years of Government effort to spread it, is the privilege of a
                        very few, the Government is not only entitled but bound to exercise some
                        supervision to prevent its being misused. No doubt the great powers
                        possessed by a Government like that of India could conceivably be misused.
                        Everyone will admit that in theory. But in practice the character of the
                        Indian Government and its splendid tradition of equity and tolerance are a
                        great guarantee, and to those people in this country who favour the
                        development of self-government in India, as elsewhere, there could be no
                        better guarantee that the Indian Government will not misuse the powers which
                        it possesses for dealing with sedition and disturbance than the character of
                        Mr. Morley. It is not likely that he will err on the side of unnecessary
                        severity.</p>

                        <p>The prices of gum at Dueim and Omdurman have gone up very hgih. The

                            This rise is attributed to the shortage of arrivals due to the approach
                            of the rainy season, and to the rise in the prices of the article in
                            Europe. In London, gum is fetching 38s. per cwt.</p>

                        REPLY.</head>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel appears to be very' greatly enraged by the granting of
                        the freedom of the City of London to Lord. Cromer asa mark'of the high
                        esteem in whicli his work in Egypt is 'held at home. Ina remarkable and
                        amusing article the "Egyptian - ird" takes Reuter's Agency and the pondents
                        of the Occupation Press to ia for having emphasised the honour and
                        significance of such a conferment. The same paper insinuates that no mention
                        was made of a similar conferment on Lord Lister, but we humbly beg to refer
                        the. writer of the article in, question to the issue of the "Egyptian
                        Gazette" of Thorsday the 6th inst. The repro- duetion of the article will
                        give further proof to our readers abroad that Mustapha Kamel can hardly be
                        actuated in his writings by a reasonable spirit, for no reason for such an
                        outburst of rage could be offered by any of his supporters. It is: somewhat
                        amusing that the artidle insists upon the omission of Lord Lister's namein
                        the telegram announcing the honour to Lord Cromer as being wilful, whereas
                        the heading 1eads "careless omission," We might also remark that Mustapha
                        Kamel has at times taken pains to point out that it was only Lord Cromer's
                        policy which he attacked, while this article shows extreme personal venom.
                        The following is the text in extenso:— </p>
                    <p>"It will be remembered what a fuss was made over Lord Cromer's being offered
                        the freedom of the City of London.</p>
                    <p>"Reuter's Agency and the correspondents of the Occupation papers wired in
                        magnificent enthusiastic terms, the glorious news of the unparalleled honou
                        conferred upon the great Earl of Cromer by the stupifying generosity of the
                        City Corporation.</p>
                    <p>"And Cromerites were thunderstruck. They remained bouche-bes. They gushed all
                        over with pride and felt patriotic-——-Cro-merrily' pa- triotic—and cheered
                        the, ex-pro-Consul and praised the Lord that they were Imperialists</p>
                    <p>"But what neither Reuter's Agency nor the correspondents of the Occupation
                        papers stated —they even shunned it as doth a mule a tin- can—was that Lord
                        Cromer:was not the only Lord whom it was proposed to hononr in the way.</p>
                    <p>"Of course they did not state so. It would have detracted from the importance
                        of the unparallelism, which they wished to impress upon the Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>"So naturally, with the remarkably fine, gentlernanly sense of impartiality
                        which cha- racterises the Imperialist bogey press, they left the other Lord
                        out in the cold, and passed over the honor conferred upon him with com-
                        prehensible though not exactly justifiable disdain,</p>
                    <p>"Who was the other Lord ?</p>
                    <p>"Ps — Lord Lister—a somebody, perhaps a nobody in Cromerite eyes, but. still
                        a greater man thar the Earl of Cromer was the genius whom the City
                        Corporation offered in the first place, thie freedom of the City of
                        London.</p>
                    <p>"Tt is/excusable perhaps, this omission on the part of Reuter's Agency
                        and.the correspondents of the Imperislist, justice-loving press. Because,
                        blinded by: their fatuity for Lord Cromer, they ignore the existence of all
                        other Lords.</p>
                    <p>"We are sorry to-day to have to throw a backet of cold water upon their
                        rejoicing and at the same time to reveal to the impartial members of
                        Egyptian society to what moral extremes the Imperialist press can go when
                        bent upon furthering imperialism regardless of the colour or nature of the
                        means they employ.</p>
                    <p>"Lord Lister, with Guthrie and Pasteur one of the greatest 'saviours of
                        humanity; Lord Lister, the propagator 'of antiseptic surgery ; Lord Lister
                        the eminent surgeon who had saved the lives of thousands, hundreds of
                        thonsands of doomed invalids and_ sufferers ; Lord Lister—well Lord Lister
                        dwindled away 'at-the shadow of nothing beside the gigantic hero of
                        Denshawai, beside the man who would not'commutate an unjust death sentence,
                        who officially insulted the religion of three hundred million souls as might
                        have done a fanatic missionary.</p>
                    <p>"Dwindles away to nothing/Ab, time will say !</p>
                    <p>"'o-day, and inspite of Reuter's agency and the correspondents of the'
                        Occupation press, the gratitude of milions repays Lord Lister for his deeds,
                        whereas a few stock-brokers, bondholders speculators, financiers and ¢a-
                        pitalists—together with their officially trampet- press organs—are the only
                        grateful debtors of the Earl of Cromer.</p>
                    <p>"And to think that the /reédom of a city has been given to a man who has
                        become eminent in Imperialist arenas because he refused to give freedom toa
                        country! Itis the non plus ultra of political irony."</p>

                        took place on Thursday morning at 10-80 a.m. before the French Consul, Mr.
                        Paul de Reffye, who was assisted in his difficult task by Messrs: Favenc
                        and' Bianchi, After many witnesses had been called, Maitre Widal, counsel
                        for the plaintif rose, and, in the course of « lengthy address, eloquently
                        referred to the evils and discomforts. attributable to hasty tempers. He
                        further pointed out that, the-opprobrious and insulting terms, which his
                        client, Mr. Cheki-Ganem, is alleged to have used towards the defendant, were
                        tot proyed, and that according to the evidence, no, provocation whatever had
                        been given to justify so brutal an attack. During his M. Widal frequently
                        appealed with great. ex- citement to the President, for the of the Tribunal,
                        stating that it was quite possible for him to proceed, while the defendant
                        was permitted to insult him, The. President, however, was unable to admit
                        thatany cause for complaint had been established and held that the case must
                        continue.. M. Widal, who was evidently much upset by this contretemps, soon
                        after took his seat.</p>
                    <p>In reply to M. Widal, M. Guithaumon delivered a stirring defence. He related

                    <head>SABA PASHA'S RECORD.<lb/>HENNIKER-HEATON'S TRIBUTE</head>
                    <p>Mr. Henniker Heaton, M.p., writes as follows to the "Times"</p>
                    <p>On Saturday next his Excellency Saba Pasha, after 35 years' service, and over
                        20 years Postmaster-General of Egypt, retires from the service for a
                        well-earned rest. The record of his services shows that he is one of the
                        most progressive Postmaster-General in the world. The post-office gives an
                        excellent indica-tion of the progress of a country. Saba Pasha has just
                        issued his last annual report and in it he gives statistics showing the
                        marvellous growth of the Egyptian Post Office. Egypt is one of the two
                        countries in the world that have proclaimed universal penny postage, the
                        other being New Zealand. From January 1, 1887, when Saba Pasha took over
                        postal administra-tion of Egypt, the correspondence has quintup-led. In 1886
                        the number of letters dealt with was 12,695,000, and in 1906 the number had
                        increased to 58,800,000. The tax (postage) on letters from Egypt to the
                        United Kingdom was reduced on December 15, 1905, to five mil-liemes = one
                        penny. In consequence, the number of letters exchanged with the United
                        Kingdom and British colonies in 1906 increased by 60 per cent. He hopes and
                        believes that universal penny postage will be carried at the next Postal
                        Congress at Madrid in 1912. Another very interesting paragraph in the annual
                        report is the reference to the special savings bank for children which was
                        inaugurat-ed in 1905. A postal clerk goes round to all the principal schools
                        in Cairo and Alexandria, takes the scholars' savings, and writes up their
                        books after delivering and receiving money, et., just as it is done in the
                        post-office. This system saves the children having to go to the post-office
                        to effect their little economies. The report goes on to show that in all
                        branches of the postal service the business has increased from 5 to 14 per
                        cent in the lst year ; and finally, the postal receipts in 1906 are put down
                        at 237,000 and the expenses at 185,000, giving 52,000 surplus. Next to Lord
                        Cromer, the great Pro-Consul, few men have worked harder or more zealously
                        for Egypt than Saba Pasha, and form all parts testimonials and expressions
                        of high regard and regret are being tendered to the able Postmaster-General
                        on his impending retirement.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir,-The correspondence which has been going on lately under the
                            above heading has been surely rather "instructive" than "amusing", as
                            "Diogenes" evidently thinks. It has been instructive, in that it has
                            shown us the exact moral standard of the majoirty of our
                            fellow-countrymen in Alexandria who welcome these "undesirables" and
                            cannot dis-tinguish between ladies of the full world and those of the
                            "half world." This short sighted-ness is doubtless due to their greater
                            familiar-ity with the latter type, owing to constant intercourse and
                            associationi with them. These poor "ladies" are rightly described as
                            "more sinned against than sinning," and it is doubt-less due to the fact
                            that "Don Juan," "Impartial," "Diogenes" and company feel that they are
                            the "sinners" that they feel it is only fair to take the side of the
                            "sinned against." This is a very laudable sentiment. However there are
                            some members and race-goers whohave a certain amount of respect for
                            their wives and sisters, and for this small minority of Alexandrians I
                            would suggest the formation of a member's enclosure at future
                            meetings.-I enclose my card and beg to sign myself.</p>

                        <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</head>
                        <p>Dear Sir, - Without wishing to prolong in any way the discussion in your
                            columns of the question of the admission of "undesirables," to the
                            grounds of the Alexandria Sorting Club, may I point out that the same
                            evil exists at almost every race course in the world, and that the
                            average man or woman of the world has long since learnt to shrug his or
                            her shoulders at its existence. If you attempt to exclude persons as
                            "undesirable" you must prove that the persons excluded are what they are
                            accused of being at the time of their exclusion, your evidence must be
                            convincing and derived, not from tittle-tattle or from merely
                            circumstantial evidence supplied by rakish hats and artificial
                            complexions, but from the testimony of un-impeachable witnesses. Now it
                            seems to me that these witnesses will not be forthcoming in the majority
                            of cases for obvious reasons, and anything like an attempt to exclude
                            persons on insufficient testimony may well lead to libel actions. I
                            cannot help thinking that a lady whose peculiarities of dress or manner
                            caused her to be wrongfully excluded as an "undesir-able" from any
                            public meeting place, would have an excellent case against her
                            excluders. As for the question of morality, I fail to see why, as long
                            as the women complained of be-have with decorum , that there should be
                            any reason to exclude them. I grant that they frequently dress in
                            appalling taste, but that is not an affair for the local censors, but if
                            they conduct themselves with decency, why brand them for paying homage
                            to the observances of society? They imitate and flatter their desirable
                            and virtuous sisters who go to the races in smart frocks and I have
                            never heard that virtuous sisters who go to the races in smart frocks
                            and I have never heard that virtuous women were guaranteed like
                            trademarks against counterfeits. As for the question of duty, surely no
                            woman or man can really desire that their less fortunate fellow
                            creatures should be given no chance whatever of harmless amusement and
                            recreation, and for past errors or misfortunes be compelled to endure
                            all the penalties of public outracism.</p>
                        <p>If you want to prevent people who have joined the "undesirable" class
                            from ever re-habilitating their character, then by all means boycott
                            them, prevent them from entering race courses, concert rooms, libraries,
                            churches and good hotels, let them know that they are irretrievably
                            lost, that by losing one virtue they have lost all claim to
                            consideration, and you will certainly effect your object, and by
                            crushing the last vestiges of their self-respect condemn them to a
                            brutalised existence, ever on the down grade. Only you must not be
                            surprised if such victims of your zeal show a strong dislike to be
                            "reclaimed" or reformed, and a great disbelief in your assertion that
                            you are indulging in these outbursts of moral vigour for their good or
                            for the good of society. You brutalise and degrade them still further,
                            and by adding to the sum total of degradation you degrade society, which
                            cannot benefit from the existence of a class of outcasts. Lastly may I
                            say that it seems to have been forhotten by some of your contributors
                            that "charity" is a Christian virtue, and, if we are to attach any
                            importance to. Holy Writ, is the higheset of human virtues and the most
                            beneficial of all, in that it can raise even the lowest.-Yours, etc.</p>

                        <p>Sir,-It is really gratifying to see that the well known solicitor is at
                            last having his well earned rest after the exciting time he passed
                            through at Campo Cesare ; but at the same time it is so sad to see that
                            his poor dear friend "Unsatisfied" cannot give up, a la Sarah Bernhardt,
                            his trivial polemics.</p>

                    <byline>(From the Alexandria Correspondent of the Times," dated September 7,
                        1897.)</byline>
                    <p>This morning saw Alexandria endowed; with an 'interesting monument, a relic
                        of the Ptolemaic days. About 20 years ago there was discovered in the
                        grounds of a Jewish school 'the shaft of a large handséme rosé' granite
                        column ; this was presented to the Municipality by Baron Jacques Menasce but
                        no use was made of it until quite recently. Dr. Schiess Bey, director of the
                        Government, hos- pitol, offered to erect it on a prominent site ae ae from
                        which it is' visible far out to sea, u himself the responsi- bility for all
                        risks and expense.</p>
                    <p>By good fortane his excavations resulted in fi the capital almost uninjured
                        at 30ft. distance from the shaft, The length of shaft is over 34 ft. witha
                        diameter of 8} feet and weight 70 tons. 'The base, a separate piece, is 2
                        feet 4 inchesin height, by 5ft. Sin. diameter, and the capital, which
                        consists of two pieces, is 4ft. Gin. in height by 7ft. 9 in. diagonai
                        breadth. One side of it is.not carved, but has cuts made for inserting metal
                        cramps, as thoggh it' were originally attached to a building, the capital
                        gonsiderably overhanging the base of the column. The monument when completed
                        will measure 55ft. 7in. from the ground to the summit. The column is
                        believed to have belonged to the temple of Saturn which early in the fourth
                        century was transformed into the:church of St. Michael.</p>
                    <p>The following inscription is on a scroll deposited in the pedestal of gray
                        stone built. to support the column.</p>
                    <p>"This colamn was erected in commemoration of the fall of Omdurman and Khartum
                        (Sept. 2 1898) a victory won by-the troops of Victoria, Queen,and Empress,
                        fighting side by side with the soldiers of Abbas Hilmy, Khedive of Egypt.

                        avenging of the death of Gordon Pasha, was rendered possible by the
                        prosperity of Egypt, chiefly due to the wise counsels of the English
                        Minister Plenipo- tentiary, Lord Cromer, and the hearty co- operation of

                    <p>A statue of Gordon would worthily crown the column, and Ihave been asked to.
                        bring the suggestion to the notice of the friends of the late.General in the
                        hope that they will approve of it and further it's execution, as there is no
                        monument to his memory in this country, for which he did so much and finally
                        gave his life.</p>
                    <p>Another monoment, also due to the initia tive of Dr. Schiess, is a beautifnl
                        white marble column with a composite capital of green granite which he
                        discovered during his ex- cavations in ground belonging to the Hibspital.
                        This column he erected in 1897 to commem- orate the Queen's jubilee ; it
                        stands on a knoll in the hospital garden overlooking the sea, and.bears on
                        "the pedestal the following inscription</p>
                    <p>Victoriae</p>
                    <p>Britt. Reg. Fid. Def.</p>

                    <p>Jt seems apity that the learned societies of England display little or no
                        interest .in the Greek and Roman antiquities of Alexandria and the
                        neighbourhood, where very much of great value still remains buried.</p>
                    <p>The city museum now contains a highly interesting collection, which, however,
                        bunt few travellers stay to visit.</p>
                    <p>Nota Bene. It seems strange that Schiess Pasha should have on two occasions
                        this shown his appreciation of the British rule in country, by erecting two
                        columns at his own expense in this city, and yet has never received any
                        token from the British au- thorities, here or in Downing Street, of these
                        generous actions. We feel positive that if H.M. King Edward VIII was aware
                        of such apparent ingratitude on the part of the British com- munity and of
                        the Powers that be, His Majesty himself would rectify the oversight.</p>

                    <head>FOURTH SUMMER MEETING.</head>
                    <p>Excellent weather favored the second day's racing of the Fourth Summer
                        Meeting and the attendance 'was one of the best and most fashionable we have
                        seen this season. Amongst those present we noticed Sir Eldon Gorst, Sir
                        William Garstin, Rear Admiral Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield, Borton Bey,
                        Hopkinson Bey and the Hon. Mrs. Hopkinson. Racing and betting were keen, the
                        chief interest of 'the afternoon being centred upon the Summer Handicap for
                        which fifteen. runners went to the post and the Mahmoudieh Cup which brought
                        out Carlton and Aurelius meeting at only a difference of 8.Jbs, and it was
                        generally anticipated that the former would reverse the result of Thursday's
                        running, but he was not game enough and Aurelius-won comfortably. The
                        Band,of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers under the conduetorship of Band- master
                        A. Fawcetéplayed during the afternoon.</p>
