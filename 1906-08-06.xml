                    <head>TRIPOLI, FRANCE. AND THE SULTAN</head>
                    <p>Tripoli is so near Egypt that any attempts ot the Sultan to increase his
                        power there is of considerable interest to us. With regard to the question
                        of the oasis of Djanet, whether the Turkish Government has despatched
                        Captain Abdul Kader with forty men, the Porte declares that the territory is
                        Turkish, being a portion of the vilayet of Tripoli, and that a holy flag is
                        preserved at Djanet, whose inhabitants pay taxes to the Turkish authorities.
                        The Frenoh Embassy at Constantinople presented a Note last week declaring
                        that Djanet was recognised as French territory by the Anglo Frenoh
                        agreement, and warning the Porte of the dangerous consequences of main
                        taining troops there. To this Note, according to Renter's telegram of
                        Saturday, the Porte has replied maintaining her olaim to Djanet as an
                        integral portion of the vilayet of Tripoli Djanet is due west of
                        Assouan.</p>
                    <p>The French have a great problem before them in their vast land-locked Empire
                        in the centre of Africa. With remarkable energy and success they have
                        gradually brought more of the provinces in their sphere of action under
                        control, but the vital question of how to utilize them after the conquest is
                        one which most cause considerable anxiety for a long time to come. Owing to
                        difficulties of access they are likely to be as valuable as oolonies in the
                        moon. Tripoli is still, and is likely to remain for some time, the best
                        route to the new Frenoh empire. The greatest problem which France has to
                        face <cb n="6"/> is the finding of means of communication and an outlet for
                        possible trade. Sokoto, Bornu, and Bigirmi are in a fair way towards being
                        settled, but Wadai remains to be conqaerel. Whichever way they tarn
                        Frenchmen are faced with thousands of miles ot semi desett, dotted only with
                        occasional oases and almost impossible caravan routes through the belt ot
                        the Great Sahara. For a century Tripoli haa been the best and most praotioal
                        opening for trade with the oentre of Africa, for the methods of
                        communicating through Algiers and Tania present apparently insurmountable
                        difficulties. The oaravan routes from Tripoli are practicable, and with very
                        little trouble could be improved. The 'Parks have never attempted to
                        exercise an active power in Central Africa, confining themselves within
                        their most southern boundary of Fezzan ; bat geographically and through the
                        complete monopoly of trading relations the Hinterlands of Tripoli, including
                        Bornu, Bagirmi, and Wadai, certainly fall to the Sultan. These rights were,
                        of course, ignored by both Great Britain and France when the Convention of
                        1899 was signified, and the protests of the Saltan of Tarkey went
                        unheeded.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the scheme of capturing the trade of Central Africa and
                        diverting it from the Tripoli route to Tunis has been another of France's
                        ambitions, for the oaravans pass temptingly close to the Tunisian frontier
                        via Ghadames and Ghat on their way to Bornu and the Western Sadan. It is
                        almost oertaio that a few years ago the Frenoh intended to take in Ghadames,
                        which is a wealthy centre of Arab caravan traders and so tear the frontier
                        as easily to be made a matter of dispute. For no reason which could be
                        justified by the military necessity of paoitying Tunis, the French very
                        quietly established a strong military base at the extreme south of Tonis in
                        Gabes, this town being selected because it possesses excellent water, a
                        rarity in this dry country. Large barracks and hospitals were built and vast
                        stores collected, all being very nnostentatioasly brought with the troops by
                        the regular steamers from Marseilles. No doubt whatever was felt in Tripoli
                        about the intention of the French to seize some portion of it at least, and
                        the Italians themselves were extremely nervous and anxious. They went to the
                        length of picking a qaarrel with the Governor of Benghazi as though to look
                        for compeQsatiou in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Sultan became seriously alarmed. With astonishing celerity he
                        despatched steamer after steamer to Tripoli with men and stores, and it was
                        compnted by the Consulat authorities there that in a very few months at
                        least 30,000 Tarkish soldiers had been landed and for the most part
                        immediately hurried off to the Tunisian frontier. ' New forts were bailt,
                        the old ones were repaired, and the harbour of Tripoli was proteo'ed by
                        torpedoes. For some months the Tarkish and Frenoh troops faoed each other at
                        the frontier, and many little Rcidents occurred which could easily have been
                        made the cause of a qaarrel; but the astute diplomacy of the then
                        Governor-General, Rassim Pasha, warded off a corfiiet. For months the
                        position was extremely strained. Measures were being taken in the town of
                        Tripoli itself with a view to protecting the Christians against the rising
                        anger of the Moslem population. But the Turkish position was too strong. The
                        French coaid not master more than 10,COO troops to meet the 30,000 Turks,
                        who were by no means the andis-o plined horde the French had had to deal
                        with under the Bey of Tunis. France was evidently not prepared or inolined
                        to undertake an expedition on a large scale, and a joint commission was
                        appointed to delimitate the frontiers, and the incident ended. The oamp
                        Gabes was declared unhealthy, and the French troops were gradually
                        withdrawn. Evidence of this abortive soheme ia still to be seen in the empty
                        barracks at Gabea. Bat the ambition to captare the trade with Central Africa
                        still lingers, and many studies were made from Gabes with a view to
                        diverting he trade from Tripoli. Oae of these schemes endei in the fatal
                        termination of the career of the somewhat fanatical Marquis de Morbs, who,
                        while attempting to penetrate into the inferior from Gabes, was murdered
                        only a few days' march inland by the tribe of the Chaamba. It is evident
                        that the French wilkhe obliged to establish some means of commnnioation with
                        the Mediterranean coast if they are to benefit by their Central African
                        colonies, through Beughaz: from Wadai and throngh Tanis, failing Tripoli,
                        from Bornu and the Western SudaD. What there may be in the unpublished part
                        of the Franco-Italian agreement, or what understanding may have been arrived
                        at regarding the fature working of the caravan trade with Italy, we do not
                        yet know ; in any case neither ooantry has an enviable task before it. And
                        judging from the news in the telegram the Sultan has taken up a firm stand
                        against all suoh pretensions.</p>

                    <p>A Santa correspondent writes that a demonstration against the Christians was
                        made last week at the village of Sonnonres, Fayoum, by mobs of Moslems, who
                        paraded the streets, brandishing nabouts, and with the cry of "Kill or
                        convert" raided the Greek and Coptic shops, and maltreated the shopkeepers.
                        The police intervened in time to check the development of the outbreak, and
                        an enquiry is proceeding. This riot may probably have been due to the
                        conversion of a sheikh to Coptic Christianity. "Al Mokattam" learns that a
                        few days ago some low-class Moslems ot Akhmin, in Upper Egypt, attacked a
                        Coptic funeral in that town and threw stones at the mourners. The aggressors

                    <p>MR. FINDLAY'S CHARGES</p>
                    <p>The charges of bribery brought by Mr. Mansfield de C. Findlay in his telegram
                        to Sir E. Grey against the section of the European and vernacular press
                        which did not hold the same views as the British Agency in regard to the
                        Denishwai affair, are thus commented on by "Al Moayad" :— The British
                        Diplomatic Agency appears to have gone into the Denishwai affair with
                        definite political ends in view. One was to stop Parliament having any voice
                        in Egyptian affairs, and the other was to suppress the liberty of the
                        Egyptian press. What could the British Agency answer if it were asked to
                        prove that the newspapers' articles showed that they had received a large
                        sum of money as a subsidy ? Has not the British Agency excited the Egyptian
                        Press by the hue and cry it raised and by charging the whole country with
                        fanaticism for which the Press is held responsible? How can the papers
                        receive bribes for simply defending themselves ? Who is it who laid out this
                        money? Possibly our contemporary, the "Egyptian Gazette," would agree with
                        us if we opine that the recent changes in the plans and policy of England in
                        Egypt have been due to the standpoint which the local Press took up in the
                        Denishwai affair. These opinions of the Press were regarded by Mr. Findlay
                        as severe strictures on the British Administration in Egypt. If our
                        contemporary refuses to accept this view, and Mr. Findlay remains
                        unconvinced of the true facts as indicated by "Al Moayad," then we, in our
                        position as a national representative newspaper, will prove the falseness of
                        the charge of the British Charge d'Affaires and will boldly declare that if
                        anyone makes any insinuations of bribery against "Al Moayad" let him prove
                        it; otherwise, however high be his position, his insinuation must be
                        considered as a falsehood. "Al Lewa" remarks apropos of Mr. Findlay's
                        charges, that this is part of the English policy, to attempt to throw
                        discredit on the native Press and thereby to remove the effects which the
                        outcry these papers made over the Denishwai affair had in London.</p>

                    <p> With reference to a report published in thfl "Egyptian Gszette" of the 27th
                        ultimo headed "Our Berbereen," it appears that the facts of the case are as
                        follows:— Policemen No. 1131, who was on beat duty at Clot Bey street,
                        seeing a disturbance at Atfet E Suk, went to the spot to see what the matter
                        was. He found an Italian named Giovanni Prola and a native coffee-shop
                        keeper quarrelling, and a knife in the former's hand. He called ghaffir No.
                        7, and both took the Italian and native to the oaraool, where a proefes
                        verbal was drawn up against them for brawling. The chief points elioited by
                        the evidence are:— (l) That the policeman was not present when the affair
                        began (according to the Italian and his witnesses, they never saw him at
                        all); (2) The Italian is not more than 40 years of age, and is not the
                        proprietor of the land, which belongs to a Copt who looks alter it for his
                        mother ; (3) There is no evidence of the ghaffir striking the Italian; (4)
                        There were no Berbereen present, or at the most there was only one; (5) The
                        "Frenchman" who interfered is known by sight, Oddly and is believed to have
                        been a Qresk. The orderly r fiber who drew up the procks verbal made a note
                        in same to the effeot that the European said to have been attacked was
                        slightly drunk.</p>

                    <head>THE SOHAG TRAGEDY<lb/>How Mr. Horton Met His Death</head>
                    <p>Last Friday we published a telegram from a Sohag correspondent reporting the
                        death of Mr. George Hortoh, an inspector of the Sleeping Car Company, whose
                        head was cut off while the train on which he was travelling was passing
                        under Kanafi Bridge. From inquiries which we have made, and from the inquest
                        which was held on Saturday morning at the German Hospital by Mr. A. D.
                        Alban, we have elicited the facts connected with deceased's terrible death,
                        which are as follows :— On Thursday, Mr. Hortob left Luxor by the 5.30 p.m.
                        train in charge of the sleeping and restaurant cars. There being but few
                        passengers, the deceased, after dinner, went to the roof of the car, where
                        he sat for some time by himself. It appears that he was aconstomed to travel
                        in this way. Somewhat later he invited Gastave Frohman, maltre d'hotel, to
                        join him on the roof, remarking that to travel in snob a position was most
                        pleasant. Deceased was joined by Frohman, who sat on the top step of the
                        ladder, the former being upon the roof of the sleeping car facing the
                        engine. After remaining there some time Frohman complain-ed of the dost,
                        which, he said, blinded him, and went back to the dining-car to get the dost
                        out of his eyes. On returning to join deceased he found that he had changed
                        from the sleeping to the dining oar q^d was sitting with his back to the
                        engine. Mr. Hortob and Frohman then sat side by side, and on reaohing Kanafi
                        Bridge the latter felt something strike his left ear. He bent his he id and
                        Bext saw Mr. Hortob tumbling down head over heels. Frohman desoended to
                        inform the conductor of the sleeping oar, and on arriving at 8ohag, which is
                        only twj kilometres distant from the scene of the accident, they returned on
                        a pilot engine and fonnd that the greater part of Hortob's head was severed
                        from his body, which was removed to the Sohag hospital, where the
                        procks-verbal was drawn np. On the following day the body was removed to
                        Cairo, where the inquest was held on Saturday at the German Hospital. The
                        body was identified by Mr. Garriok, a fiiend of the deceased, and Mr.
                        Chaker, chief controller of the company, and permission for bnrial was
                        given, though the inquest was adjourned until Monday in order to take the
                        evidence of Frohman. The body was interred the same morning. Mr. Hortob
                        leaves a widow, who, we regret to say, will be left in very needy oiron
                        instances on aoooont of the terrible death of her husband. We would,
                        therefore, give prominence to the fact that the company are asking for
                        donations in aid of Mrs. Hortob ander these distressing cironmstanoes. Both
                        deceased and his widow are of English nationality, and we hope that the
                        necessary support will be promptly forthcoming. Donations should be
                        addressed to the Cairo office of the Sleeping Car Company, at the
                        station.</p>

                    <head>THE SULTAN<lb/>AMERICAN OPINION.</head>
                    <p>The ' New York Evening Mail" remarks :— Lately our ministry to Brazil was
                        raised to the grade of an embassy, as a compliment to that country. We
                        maintain an ambassador to Mexico for maoh the same reason. Partly this, and
                        partly in order that our representative may not be outranked in either of
                        those American countries by the diplomatic agent of any foreign power. But
                        it is not as a compliment that we have made onr minister to Turkey an
                        ambassador. Of conrse it pasres as a distinguished honour, but the motive is
                        really qaite the reverse. Every six months or so the Ottoman Saltan has to
                        he bullied about something. Force is the only international argument that he
                        appreciates. Pressure has to be applied to him by the representative of tha
                        country that has business with himj and it is most snooessfally applied by
                        the agent who has the right to walk into the Saltan's presence. Ambassadors
                        porsess this right: ministers and envoys have the privilege only by the
                        sovereign's invitation or permission. Mr. Leishman, our representative at
                        the Sublime Porte, is a good Snltan-balldozai, bat he has laboured under the
                        disadvantage of being a mere minister. Congress has made him an ambassador.
                        Now he will be a better ball-dizer than ever, for he can walk into the
                        Saltan's private office and say, "See here, yonr sublime and ineffable
                        imperial majesty, it is up to yon to do thus and so." Naturally the Saltan
                        does not appreciate the honour done him in making our minister an
                        ambassador. But if we oorreotly apprehend the character of Mr. Leishman, he
                        will make an early call upon Abdul Hamid jast the same, and will gently but
                        firmly convince him that no other course is open to him. When Uncle Sam
                        decides to honour a Saltan somewhere, that Saltan may as well make up his
                        mind to be honoured.</p>

                        otherwise. It is true an "official" report of the proceedings was issued
                        —but then it is only an "official" report. As it happens, however, the
                        secrecy of the proceedings does not render them less interesting, or, if we
                        may say so, less significant. Yet we are puzzled to account for it. What
                        possible reason can our Little Englander friends have for maintaining
                        secrecy ? It cannot be that they are ashamed of their views, for, as we are
                        aware, they glory in demonstrating to the world how often and how utterly
                        their native country is in the wrong. We oan only suppose that, out of
                        compliment to Kamel Pasha, it was arranged to give the proceedings as much
                        of the air of a little conspiracy as possible. We do not imagine that
                        dreadful things passed at the meeting. It is highly improbable that the
                        guests circulated a oup of blood, after the manner libellonnly imputed to
                        that pre-Canarian Canar, Catiline, and it is even questionable if the green
                        flag was elevated above the Union Jaok amid thunderous cheers for Mahomet.
                        What is more likely is that the missioner of New Egypt was bathed in a
                        congenial atmosphere of "hot air," and that, like the noble animal whose
                        name he bears, the personage of the evening comported himself with much
                        droll dignity. The Kamel of Nationalism has set out on a protracted journey.
                        His ways may be devious, and his goal obscure, but his time cannot be
                        considered to be wholly wasted if he succeeded yesterday in pawing some sand
                        into the eyes ot a small section of the British public. Let ns hope that his
                        futile efforts will give him his namesake's proverbial "hump." The following
                        is the text of the speech of Mr. John M. Robertson, M. P. for Tyneside, of
                        on the occasion of the historio lunoh :— Monsieur le Pacha, Parlant an nom

                        inst.:— Land Purchases.—At the close of the period ended 30th September,
                        1905, the area of lands purchased aggregate! 479,275 feddans, at a total
                        cost of £127,950, in addition to a one sixth interest in valuable property
                        in the Province of Qharbieh comprising 1,577 feddans. The principal
                        properties are in the neighbourhood of Cairo, Tantah, Behra, and other
                        important towns and villages. During the half-year under review, a farther
                        30,178 feddans of land have been purchased at a total cost of £4,320 12s.
                        3d. Also an interest in other properties, consisting of land, building, at a
                        cost of £164,102 Ils. 3d. The total amount of purchases made by the company
                        at 31st March 1906, was £305,990 9s. 7d., on which deferred payments
                        amounting to £104,695 7. 7d. still had to be met. The whole of the purchases
                        made are shown in the balance sheet at cost price plus interest on deferred
                        payments. Development andSales.—The development of our properties has been
                        steadily pushed forward and at the end of March, 1906, the first of the
                        compauy's land sales was held, the results, after allowing for cost of
                        drainage, roads, being in the opinion of the directors most satisfactory. As

                    <p>i:v A FEMALE PHILOSOPHER.</p>
                    <p>The other day I ventured to offer a few suggestions for the reading, marking,
                        and inward digestion of a woman with regard to the keeping, when woo, of the
                        love and interest of that most fiokle of all animals - Man. It is a pet
                        theory among men that woman is more incoonstant and more difficult to
                        understand than themselves. There never was a greater delusion. If a man
                        cannot have the woman he oan pat in a very excellent and enjoyable time with
                        a woman, especially if she is pretty and bright, and the woman is for the
                        time forgotten. If a woman cannot have the man, she feels all the time she
                        is with a man how lovely it would be if only it were someone else ! Then, as
                        regards the relative complexity of the two sexes, my experience has taught
                        me that given ten average women and a certain set of oircumstances, nine out
                        of the ten will act in the same way, and you can always forecast what that
                        way will be. But given ten average men and the same set of circumstances,
                        and they will act in ten different ways, and yoa oannot safq'y foretell one
                        of them.</p>
                    <p>But I am wandering from iny point, which is the other side of the
                        ijaestioq—namely, tfie retention of a woman's love and respect by a man.</p>
                    <p>This, it most be admitted from the beginning, is a far easier matter. A man
                        has his professjqq or business, his sports, his friends, his olob, and a
                        thousand and one interests which inevitably olaim and divide his attention
                        and affections. A woman as a rule has one centre, one pivot to her life—her
                        one particqlqr iqan, and even if she has h0r Aa4 be? aporta and her other
                        qatgide inters >ts, they form bat a relatively sajsll fraotiqu o^ l)3r life.
                        2\nd then there is the que ofteq ignqre4 bqt all- powerful factor that
                        should never be fof- gotteq -that qjan is by n%tqrq tlje love? cf bat one—at
                        a time I Bat oqoe again, as in my humble advice to woman, let oq$ repeat
                        that my suggestions are for the or4inary average mixture of good and bad,
                        everyday mem bars of mankind, not for the heartless brute, nor yet for the
                        Galahad whom we all long, and most of as in vain, to meet.</p>
                    <p>Don't let a woman find you out in a lie.</p>
                    <p>1 say advisedy, doq't let her fiid yoa out, the alternative, "Ifon't tell
                        fyer a lie,M being possibly beyond the attainment of most. Many women labour
                        undor the illaaion—or shall l 8ay delusion ?—that most meq ^re little tin
                        George Washingtons, and it is'something like dragging one of her beliefs oat
                        by the roots if she disoovers that her man has some of the attributes of
                        Ananias. A woman still retains the idea that a man is a mentally etronger
                        and finer animal than herself, and believes him U above Ji^s,</p>
                    <p>unless she has a husband who belongs to and constantly visits a club, and
                        then film knows better), and littleness. It is an excellent illusion from
                        your point of view, and it is worth a little trouble to keep np. Woman has
                        more ge^prosity of mind than she is often given oredit for, and you will
                        generally find it pay far better in the end to t^ll fyer th0 troth and
                        appeal to that generosity, than to tell her a comfortable lie if there is
                        the least prospect of yoar being found oat. If a woman ouoe proves that a
                        maq has lied to her, he is never put back on tfie same pin* nacle again.
                        Don't be mean to a vforqan or tq any one iq her pretence. </p>
                    <p>A woman loathes the niggard in a man as she hates a spot on her nose, even if
                        she has to praotise strict economy herself. Don't be sparing in your tips to
                        a waiter or a oabby if §be is with you. Believe me, if she has not seen thp
                        amount, she will note his reoeption of the same, and by hi 1 manner \y'.ll
                        goe s at thp generosity thereof or the reverse, and judge yoa accordingly.
                        Oce of the unforgivab'e sins a man from a womau's point of view is meanneps
                        or nearness. If you have not the morey to be generous in actuality, be at
                        least generous in thought and tell her how you would like to give her this
                        or that. That will be sufficient for the average good bad wman. Benson
                        propounded one of the greatest principles of a woman's philosophy when, iq
                        ''The Image in the Sand,'1 he makes his heroine say to the maq she loves :
                        "Jf you sent me jast a line saying, *1 saw a diamond tiara at Streeter's
                        this morniup, and wanted to give it you,* that is fast the same to me as if
                        you had given it me. Your thought has given it me. It ia the thought I valae
                        ; the thing itself is only symbol of a thought." Jf you are generous in
                        neither thought nor deed you will never win a woman's loving respect,</p>
                    <p>Don't make a fool of her or raise a laugh against her before another
                        woman.</p>
                    <p>If you must make a fool of her, do it before a man and she will take it
                        good-naturedly, even if she does not join in the langh against herself. But
                        if you do it before another womaD, be it servant or friend, she will never
                        forgive you.</p>
                    <p>Don't refuse to tell her you love her, even if she asks you the question ad
                        nauseam.</p>
                    <p>You think if you have told a woman you love her that is enough- she ought to
                        have sense enpngh to know when you mean it and to be content and take it on
                        trnst. But it is not enough. A woman oannot be told itr too often. Tell a
                        woman day after day, if she requires it of yon, that you do love her and
                        make bar believe it, and then you can rob her, regleot her, be unfaithful to
                        her, And she will still cling to you and fight for you- in words in polite
                        society, or words and deed in impolite against all the world</p>
                    <p>Don't ever play second fiddle</p>
                    <p>To do yo justice you don't often try that, poet in life's orchestra. Be
                        master always. Few <cb n="4"/>women have the honesty to admit it, but in
                        reality they love a master, even if he has a touoh of the brute in his
                        methods. But, to be all-conquering, he should te master with the wilinesa of
                        the serpent as well as the foroe of the brnte. If a m in has sense enough to
                        wind up his brutality with a kiss, he will keep a woman his devoted slave
                        for ever. He may beat her—metaphorically —every day in the week, if she
                        knows that on Sanday there will be the ki?s which will pay for all.</p>
                    <p>Don't insist on seeing your wife's letters</p>
                    <p>She may have nothing whatever in her correspondence to conceal, and, if yoa
                        leave her to herself, msy possibly bore yon with reading them all aloud to
                        you. Bat she will certainly respeot yon infinitely more if yon leave her the
                        same liberty with regard to her letters that yea would undoubtedly exact for
                        your own.</p>
                    <p>Don't let her think she may make friends with impunity with other men</p>
                    <p>I do not mean be jealous on the least or no provocation, and so make yoar own
                        life as well as hers a burden; but let her think, as a matter of pare
                        policy, that you don't altogether like another man's attention, however
                        innooent. She will be so pleased yon have noticed that another man
                        appreciates her, and so glad that yoa oare sufficiently as to show incipient
                        signs of Jealousy, tfiat yoq rqay do wit^ her as you will. }f yon pretend,
                        or, worse still, if you really don'? nqind fier friendship or flirta- tioq
                        wjth another man, she will be first resent- fal, and then will 1OB6 all
                        respect for yoa for not being sufficiently Saltftq as to keep what yon have
                        gQTt *8 your own property, with all rights vested In yourself.</p>
                    <p>Last and chiefly, Don't firget the little things of life</p>
                    <p>To a woman these usually mean more than I than the big. Don't forget the
                        little attention-., "remember to ask affsra headachi, to bring an offering,
                        no matter how trifling^ for a birth. </p>

                        I" expecting to receive the stereotyped answer that "they are the
                        handsomest, tallest, best proportioned, best-dressed women in the world,11
                        Qastom almost extorts some such admission, bqt the Maharajah, DDmoved,
                        simply replied.</p>
                    <p>"I will tell you frankly. The American woman is independent, tack,
                        self-possessed, and yet, though I heard a great deal about her beauty, I
                        failed to see it. Much has been written and mocha 'said regarding the

                        maohines looked like cash registers, and the customer, after dropping in a

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
