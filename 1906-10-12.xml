                        foreces, coming on the one hand from Algeria and on the other from the
                        Niger. A year of two ago, before the respective spheres of influenced, the
                        different French possessions had been defined, a certain amount of friction
                        resulted from the rival adventures of native soldiers in French service
                        entering the Sahara from the Niger, and those coming from Algeria. Now,
                        however, that the respective spehres of influence of Algeria and West Africa
                        have been regulated, the camel corps of both regions can faternize cordially
                        when they meet in the heart of the Great Desert, that desert which is so
                        rapidly being opened up now to our konwledge.</p>
                    <p>The French, have says the "Tribune," effected much of their peaceful
                        occupation of the Sahara by means of well equipped camel corps. In the
                        summer of this year, an expedition of camel cavarly, under Colonel
                        Laperinine, reached the salt mines of Taodeni, to the south of the desert of
                        Igidi, where they found negroes at work quarrying the salt, which is spread
                        all over the regions of Nigeria as marketable product. The journey from the
                        oasis of Twat, however, was of an unusually arduous character. The little
                        banf of camel riders had to travel over several stretches of more than a
                        hundred miles each "without any pastu age for their beasts, and with no
                        water in the wells fit to drink. At a well called Tuihaya, to the north of
                        Taodeni, the drinking water looked and tasted exrremely soapy, and was
                        simply diluted posion. Everyone who drank of it swelled out to a monstrous

                        proportions. Three bottles of this terrible water have been sent to be

                    <p>It is considered that the best route fot he TRans-Saharan Railway would lie
                        to the east of Taodeni. It would, of course, be directed from Timbuktu to
                        the oasis of Twat. Twait is at no very great distance form the terminatoin
                        of the existing railway near the oasis of Figii several hundred miles to the
                        south of Oran. The distance to be covered between Twat and Timbuktu is about
                        700 miles, or about 150 miles longer than the existing Uganad Railway. There
                        are, in short, about a thousand miles of railway required to connect the
                        railways system of NOrth Africa with Timbuktu and the navigable Niger. If
                        only French economies were wisely directed instead of finding every now and
                        then their grave in a "Panama," this railway might easily and quickly be
                        made, and the advantage to the commerce and power of France in the northern
                        half of Africa would be enormous.</p>

                    <p>The Cairo correspondent of "Africa Engineering" writes:- The autumn has come,
                        and most of us here are standing by for the return of the big guns from
                        Europe. Meanwhile, a bumper season is confidently looked forward to. All
                        crop returns are favourable, and there is a continual rise in values of
                        building and gricultural land thorughout Egypt and the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>In building-construction material shippers of cheap Belgian girders will find
                        a ready market, although there is some faint hope that the British
                        Administration of Egyptian affairs will at length admit British standard
                        measurements and the Engineering Standard Committee's list of rolled
                        sections to an equality with Continental ones in spefications for Government
                        work. Conrete block builidng is likely to come into favour, and I understand
                        that the new Sermiramis Hotel, facing the Nile, has been carried out on this
                        entirely new principle among local contractors. </p>
                    <p>Since the products of the Societe Anonyme des Ciments d'Egypte - a Belgian
                        conern - have been officially admitted for the Punic Works specifications,
                        shippers of British Portland cement will find competition keener than ever.
                        Domestic sanitary appliances will also, of course, be required, and Briitsh
                        makers might with profit pay some attention to the manufacture of Arab
                        servants' conveniences in earthenware and cast iron. These are patterned on
                        the old French model, which suits the native habits. </p>
                    <p>In matters agricultural there will be increased demand for European
                        machinery, and makers of large centrifugal pump with a guranteed efficiency,
                        and steam ploughing and levelling plant ought to book some good orders from
                        certain of the land companies who are now at work reclaiming and improving
                        the soil by scientific methods.</p>
                    <p>British manufacturing engineering firms should not be deterred form paying
                        attention to the requirements of the market by more or less interested Press
                        statements about the financial risks incurrred. Owing to the total absence
                        of anything approaching an organized engineering industry, Egypt is largly a
                        dealers' marke, and it suits a great many of them get the native buyer into
                        their debt. By reason of their large profits dealrs can well afford to grant
                        the long credits so foten referred to as obligatory, but manufacturers will
                        find - as indeed, a great many have found - that a square deal can always
                        command a cash value.</p>
                    <p>I would like to say, in reply, that the legal machinery is ample to protect
                        any shipper who exercise ordinary business precaution, and is far more
                        prompt to act than at home, while as regard German firms it is to be notes
                        that of all nationalists they are least likely to give credit where none is
                        due. To give an isntance of their touching confidence in this respect, I
                        would remark that a well-konwn German firm, having recently obtained a large
                        order from a Government Department, insisted upon part of the purchase
                        money, amounting to some thousands of pounds, being paid over to thembefore
                        even putting the prelimininary drawings in hand. In face of facts of this
                        kind it is idle to dogmatise on the way British firms should or should not
                        conduct their business in Egypt, apparently without any regard to the status
                        of the selling firm, the nature of the merchandise, or the standing of the
                        customer.</p>

                        <p>The P. and O. steamship Delhi arrived at Hong Kong on the afternoon on
                            the evening of August 24 letters having thus been 244 days in transit.
                            The despatch of this mail from London eastwards was simultaneous with
                            that of the mail sent west wards by the Canadian route, the latter
                            arriving at Hong Kong on Sept. 23, and delivering the mails in 29 ½
                            days. On this showing, therefore, the Suez route is five days shorter
                            than that via Canda. The departure of the Delhi from Hong Kong to
                            Shanchai was retarded owing to the typhoon which interfered with coaling

                    <dateline>Tantah, Thuesday.</dateline>
                    <p>(FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>In my wire to you this morning, I was able to give an account of the
                        proceedings in connection with the Khedivial Agricultural Society's Show up
                        to the reception held by the Khedive on the show ground. This reception was
                        held under a beautiful marquee, which contained a number of gilt-backed
                        chairs for the accomodation of those honoured by his Highness, who included
                        the members of the comittees of the society, the provinical, notables, the
                        ulema, clergy, consular corps, etc.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the recption a move was made to the banquetting tents,
                        in one of which the Khedive preaided over a luncheon of 110 covers. In other
                        tents no less than 400 guests of the lolcal Municipality sat down to an
                        excellent luncheon, the arrangements for which, as for the other, were in
                        the hands of the Nungovich Hotels Company, which is as good as sayig that
                        they were perfect.</p>
                    <p>After luncheon, the Khedive went over the spacious show ground, which covers
                        an area of fourteen feddans, and inspected to the whole of the exhibits,
                        evincing the liveliest interest in everything. His Highness's knowledge of
                        matters argricultural is so well known that this was only to be expected. At
                        the end of his tour, on which he was accompanied by H.H. Prince Hussein
                        Pasha Kamel (president of the society) and the Ministers, the Khedive was
                        graciously pleased to express himseld as being higly satisfied with
                        everything he saw, and congratulated the secretary Mr. G. P. Fosden (who
                        conducted his Highness over the show ground) on the great success of his
                        efforts. In these efforts we may state that Mr. Foaden was very ably
                        seconded by Mr. Goodchild, who was in charge of the society's local
                        arrangment, and was likewide congratulated by his Highness, also Mohamed
                        Effendi Hussein, the local secretary.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the receotion tent, the Khedive once more held a reception, this
                        time the cultivators of Lower Egypt, accopanied by the moudirs of their
                        respective moudiriebs being received by his Highness. In the tent with his
                        Highness. In the tent with his Highness was remarked Prince Hussein Pasha
                        Kamel, Fakbry Pasha and his son, Sir Vincent Corbett, Mr. Machell, Mr.
                        Mitchell Innes, etc. </p>
                    <p>The reception over, a parade of the winning animals in the show was held in a
                        ring before his Highness. One thing that struck me in this parade was the
                        marked superiority of the mares over the stallions exhibited.</p>
                    <p>The end of the parade marked the conlucsion fo the Kehdive's visit, and after
                        bidding good-bye to the officals, his Highness drove away, as he had come,
                        accompanied by his Body Guard, to the station, where his special train was
                        in readiness at 3.15 p.m. to convey him back to Alexnadria.</p>
                    <p>It only remains to be said that the whole of the arrangements connecte with
                        the Khedive's visit were excellent, not a single hitch having occurred. The
                        police organization was especially good, and for this Moberly Bey was mainly
                        responsible. The huge crowds which lined the streets were kept in perfect
                        order. It is calculated that something like 7,000 or 8,000 strangers visited
                        Tantsh for the opening of the show and the strain thrown on the staff of the
                        railway may easily be imagined. With the exception of a somewhat
                        uncontrollable crush at the booking offices, however, everthing passed off
                        wonderfully well.</p>
                    <p>The general public was admitted to the show after the Khedive's departure,
                        and the ground was crowded throughout the afternoon. It may be interesting
                        to note that the exhibit of horses numbered 150, while there were 170 mares,
                        200 mules, 90 donkeys, and 60 camels. The exhibits of cotton, some of which
                        were remarkably fine, totalled close on 1,700 and those of grain 1,000.</p>

                    <p>For the Faithful the aniversary of the Sultan's birthday should be an
                        occasion of greater joyfulness than that of his Majesty's Acession; for the
                        former marks the memeroable date on which, not only a sovereign, but, also,
                        a Caliph and a spirtual chief came for them to the world. And yet this time
                        there seemed to be a certain lack of enthusiasm in the festive
                        demonstrations of the Moslem public. The rumors about his Majesty's illness,
                        so wildly published by every section of the European Press, may be
                        reponsible for this absence of a free jubilant note in the festive display,
                        incidental to such an important event of state in Turkey.</p>
                    <p>The official expression of the fete, however, was made in the usual way.
                        Indeed, the manner of the Vali seemed to be marked with such as particularly
                        natural cheerfulness that it inclined one to seriously doubt the recent wild
                        rumours respecting his Majesty's recarious condition of health. Inded, the
                        easy grace and natural courtesy of manner with which he holds public
                        receptions is a gift of his Excellency.</p>
                    <p>Early on Thursday morning a regiment of soldiers was drawn upabout the
                        Seraglio, where Khali Pasha, the Governor Gneral, received in state the
                        Ulema and clerical dignitaries, as well as the civil and military officials,
                        the Consular Corps, and notabiliites of the town. At about 10.30 a.m. his
                        Excellency proceeded in state to the barracks to return the visits of the
                        commandant of the Garrison and the Military Staff, The Commandant, Hakki
                        Pasha, was indisposed and Reasar-Admiral Faiek Pasha received in his stead.
                        In the reception hall of the barracks one observes on entering the portrait
                        of his Majesty with an immense painting underneath, represting the Turkish

                        portrait of the German Emperor in the imperial robe of state, symbolizing
                        the unwritten alliance between the two Empires:</p>
                    <p>After the usual exchange of courtesis the Vali proceeded to the military

                        private buildings as well, emerged in wreaths of light. The full moon,
                        however, robbed the gass ullumination of their effect. The new place of the
                        Imperial Ottoman Bank, on the quay near the Custom House, was the most
                        tastefully illuminated, the girdle of light, with the beautiful crescent and
                        star at each end, and the motto in Turkish of "Long LIve the Sultan" in the
                        middle, set off in conspicuous letters of light, relieving the otherise

                    <p>The vali held a reception till 11 p.m. in the big kiosk of the City Garden,
                        El Minshiye, where refreshments were served, and the military band played

                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>The inauguration of the Hama-Aleppo section constituting an extension of the
                        Rayak-Hama railway took place on the 4th instant, the anniversary of the
                        Sultan's birthday. No particulars are yet to hand of the banquet given on
                        this occasion, and to which it is said forty persons were to be invited.
                        There was to be an immense pavilion improvised for the occasion.</p>
                    <p>The length of this section is about 143 kilometres while the total length of
                        the line from Rayak to Aleppo is 331 kilometres. The line is of the standard
                        type, having a width of 1,435 metres and is endowed with a kilometric
                        guarantee of 15,000 francs. As this line is at present dependent on the
                        narrow cogwheel line of Beyront Famascus it is feared that its chance of
                        development and success will not be great, unless the narrow line should be
                        super seded by another broad gauge line that will o away with the runions
                        transhipment system at Rayak necessitated by the unequal width of the two
                        lines.</p>

                    <p>Sir Eveya Wood has just published his memoirs, which contains some
                        interesting sideligths in Egyptian history.</p>
                    <p>The Field Marshal will ever be remembered as the creator of the native
                        Egyptian Army, and its first Sirdar, and in dealing with his arduous life in
                        Egypt he sandwiches in two ancedotes that cannot be omitted. The first is an
                        illustration of the militant spirit then prevalent.</p>
                    <p>When the square at Abu Klea was penetrated by the Dervishes, one of them
                        attempted to spear a gunner who was in the act of ramming home a charge. The
                        Briton brained the Sudanese, but the rammer head split on the man's hard
                        skull. Next day the gunner was sent for; mistaking the reason, and knowing
                        from experience soldiers are charged for Government property they break, he
                        led off: "Please, sir, I'm very sorry I broke the rammer, but I never
                        thought the nigger's head could be so hard. I'll pay for the rammer so as to
                        hear no more of the case." </p>
                    <p>The other of these stories has to do with the famous Army chaplain, Father
                        Brindle:</p>
                    <p>Preaching one day in the desert during Lent, be said: "Now, my men. I cannot
                        ask you here on Service to abstain, but you might do something which would
                        be pleasing to the Almighty and will gratify me abstain fro the use of bad
                        language." Looking into the upturned faces, he thought from their
                        sympathetic expression he had effected some good. When the parade was
                        dismissed he stood for a few mintues speaking to some officers, and ten
                        mintues later, walking behind two of his recent congregation, who, talking
                        egaerly did not notice his footage on the soft and he overheard one say,
                        "Bill, that was a bloody fine sermon the father gave us." </p>

                    <p>A pamphlet has been issued by the Asiatic Petroleum Co., Ltd., London, of
                        which Messrs. Worms and Co. are the agents in Egypt, showing the efficacy of
                        liquid fuel as a plague preventive. In his introductory remarks to the
                        reports of which the pamplet consists the publisher writes:-</p>
                    <p>So long ago as 1797 it was observed by Mr. Baldwin, the British Consul in
                        Egypt, that, among the millions of inhabitants who died of plague in that
                        country in the space of four years, not a single oilman had suffered; and
                        Sir J. McGregor records that all men who were employed in applying oil to
                        the camels' feet during the Egyptian campaign escaped the plague. Mr.
                        Jackson states that the coolies employed in the oil stores of Tunis smeared
                        themselves with oil, and were rarely affected with plague when it raged with
                        the city. It is not perphaps remarkable, therefore, that among the many
                        experiments that have been made with various disinfectants, ptroleum, and
                        finally liquid fuel, should have been tried. </p>

                    <p>We regret that our contemporary "Le Progres" should have adopted an attitude
                        of such optimisistc scorn towards the protests of the "Minbar" against the
                        corruption prevalent among a certain number of the employee of the
                        Irrigation Department. We do not see eye to eye with our Natinoalist
                        contemporary in many matters, but sound criticism that has no political
                        bearing deserves attention whatever its service, and there is no object to
                        be gained by closing our eyes to certain supplesant facts. "Al Minbar"
                        states that several of the native engineers employed by the Irrigation
                        Department take bribes - to put matters with unpleaseant abruptness. It does
                        not mention names owing to the absence of documentary evidence of the charge
                        and is in our opinion unjustly blamed of its omission.</p>
                    <p>The receipients of backsheesh do not usually give receipts, nor do they
                        proclaim the total of their gain to the world. But when an employe in
                        receipt of from L.E 15 or less to L.E 20 per mensem, becomes in a brief
                        space of time the owner of a couple of hundred feddans of good land, keeps a
                        large establishment, and without heritage or windfall, happy investment or
                        overt robbery beceomes a comparatively sudden affluence deman
                        investigation.</p>
                    <p>We grant that it is easy to suspect corruption difficulty to prove it, and
                        that the task of the Irrigation Department, never easy, is rendered
                        peculiarly difficult by the secrecy of such transactions as those at which
                        we have hinted. But the evil exists, of that we are convinced, and that the
                        administration can only win credit by redoubling its efforts to eradicate
                        it.</p>

                    <p>The July August number of the "Revue Archeologique" give the place of hoour
                        to an article by M. Salomon Reiush describing, with the aid of several
                        pictures and the three photo graveures, two of the most valuable antiquities
                        in the collection of Dattari of Cairo. These are a bronze statuette and a
                        marble head, both assigned to Alexander the Great. The statuette shows the
                        macedonian as a youth, ridiing a cheveal, but the horse is unfrotunately
                        missing. The hero is nude except for a head fress descending over the left
                        shoulder, made up of the scalp with trunk, and part of the skin covering the
                        neck of a young elephant, and article of apparel familiar in statues of
                        Alexander and also in some representing the city of Alexandria. The figure
                        will be famous for the perfection of the anatomical rendering of the body.
                        The elephant skin served as a shield to the left arm, whilst the right
                        evidently held a javelin, or spear. The head represetns Alexander at a
                        mature age, and is particularly similar to another head of him which is now
                        known only by a drawing. It is to be hoped that these two valuable relices
                        will always remain in Egypt, which will then possess two of the most
                        important representaions of Alexander, who by the creation of the great city
                        named after him deserved so wll of the country.</p>

                        important historical work. With great care the pieces were assorted as as to

                    <head>THE PHARAOHS AND SINAI.</head>
                    <p>A French historical student writing in the "Revue des Idees." throws an
                        interesting light upon Egypt's efforts for the possession of the Sinani
                        Peninsula which go back far beyond the Christian era. Indeed, the struggle
                        appearst o be as old as Egypt itself. There is history to bear ipon it. So
                        long as 4,700 year ago, the Pharaoh Mersekhs, of the Thi ite dynasty,
                        asserted sovereignty, as is proved by stales of his reign that have been
                        found on the peninsula. Later the struggle was carried by the Pharaohs of
                        the twelfth dynasty, and was maintained with still greater vigour, when
                        Syria and the caravan routes passed under the dominion of the Asyrians. The
                        reason for Egypt's pertinancity is simplicity itself. The peninsula was to
                        ancient Egypt what the Danute was to medieval Europe - the avenue by which
                        all the wines, silks, perfumes, and rich commerce of Asia found their way
                        into the country. And Egypt could not tolerate that the narrow connecting
                        link between her and this avenue should be in possibly hostile hands. And
                        after nearly 5,000 years the might of modern England is used to preserve the
                        sentiment of a tradition that has for age lost all real practical
                        importance.</p>

                    <head>AMERICAN TRADE IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The United States agent at Alexnadria, Mr. Charles M. Pepper, in his reort to
                        Washington, says that Egypt, in the commerical sense, is the most promising
                        terriotry bordering the Mediterranean anywhere from the Straits of Gibraltar
                        ot the Red Sea.</p>
                    <p>For the principal articles of import the markets are substantially as
                        acessible to the United States as to Great Britain, which has the largest
                        share of the commerce, the differences in distance not being so important
                        when ocean freights are considred as when the traffice is dependent on
                        railway transportation.</p>
                    <p>Great Britain's lead is undisputed, especially in textiles, and she is also
                        well in advance in iron and steel productions. The Egyptian demand for motor
                        cars, motor cycles, and even bicyles is an increasing one, and this applies
                        not only to Cairo and Alexandria, wehre the most epxensive machines are in
                        favour, and where motor buses and traction cars are in use, but also to the
                        interior.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Peper suggests a parmenet American exposition in Egypt for the purpose of
                        making Americam goods known. Machienry, and particularly agricultural
                        machinery, should be the principal feature.</p>

                    <p>Nous detachons d'une lettre de Paris, en date du 3 Octobre, le passage
                        suivant:</p>
                    <p>Les retraits d;or de la Bauque d'Augleterre ont recommence a reprendre a de
                        grandes proportions. Depuis le dernier bilan (26 Septembre) les sorties ont
                        atteint £10,000 pour l'Egypte et le reste pour l;Amerique et diverses autres
                        destinations. Les besoius des Etate-Unis sont, parait-il, loin d'etre
                        satisfaits. La position des Bauques associees de New York s'est toutefois
                        quelque peu ameliorea. Yourjours est-il que le marche de Londres ne se coit
                        pas encore a l'abri de nouvelles saignees de la part de'Amerique et on criot
                        que la Banque d'Angleterre pourrait bien se voir obligee d'elever le taux
                        officiel de l'escompte a 4 ½ pour cent.</p>

                                yesterday in an agrarian outrage. 16 men attacked and moratlly
                                wounded a constable who was protecting the legal receiver.</p>
                            <p>The "Times" attributes the outrage to the recent inflammatory cratory
                                of the Nationalist leaders and emphasizes the danger of granting the

                                would be maintained from the Alps to Auarnero. The speech has caused
                                a sensation as the Quareno is Austrian, and in view of the strained
                                relations at present existing between Italy and Austria.

                            <p>The agitation against Lord Elgin's despatch proclaiming religious

                            <p>Lord Elgin's despatch beaing upon the liberty of worship in Malta is
                                arousing a spririt of bitter hostility. The leading Italian paper,
                                whilst declaring that it awaits the eccelesiastical action of the
                                Archbiship of the islands, says, with regard to the potlical
                                situation created by the Colonial Minister's instructions, that the
                                conditions under which Malata was give by its inhabitants as a mere
                                protectorate to England have illgeally violated,that the Maltese are

                                that the Church equality imposed constitues an enormity which might

                    <p>A warning is uttered by the "Practitioner" against the dangers of the
                        strenuous life. It is good to be strennous, says our contemporary, but it is
                        also good, as the poet tell us, to play the fool, or, at any rate, to be
                        idle at the right time and in the right way. This is just what the strenuous
                        man forgets, and the consequences is too often premature breakdown - a
                        common event in the storm and stress of modern life. The strenuous life is
                        helping to overcrowd our asylums. We need to learn to incalculable value of
                        rest. This consits, not in a change of excitement or in hard work,
                        disguished as a game, but in genuine repose. A man who knows how to rest
                        from labour will live longer and accomplished more than one who allows the
                        fever of strenuous living to fret his mind and body to premature decay.</p>

                        added, however, that the Maltese are grown over numerous for the size of
                        their island, and must now establish themselves in the broader world, with
                        which their race was ever in contact.</p>

                        after a weary day in the black City. Think of that beautiful but perhaps
                        impossible Ideal, the husband who never grumbles, never talks of expense,
                        never fumes when the boys want new school books, or makes a scene when his
                        wife refuses to go out because 'she has nothing to wear.' The Ideal would
                        never by any chance abuse his wifr's blood relations, spend his evenings at
                        the club and his Saturdays cycling with his men friends who have pretty
                        sistesr, cousins, and aunts. A man, in short, who never did any of the
                        thousands and one objectionable things the common or garden husband wont to
                        do. Would not any women gladly descent into the area and fight her way to
                        the front, just to keep such a domestic pet."</p>

                    <p>"MISERABLE TYPES" OF SYRIANS.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel has been intereviewed by the Paris correspondent of the
                        "Pall Mall Gazette." It will be observed that he appears to detest the
                        Syrians as much as his brother, Aly Bey Fehmy, whose recent outburst of
                        spleen against them ended by his paying a visit to the Syrian Editors at
                        Cairo to aplogise. "Miserable types" is the Pasha's apellation, and he
                        evidently intends to make short work of them as soon as he has got rid of
                        the English. Another inetresting point is the Pasha;s symbolism as
                        exemplified in his contemptuously kicking at a chair, part of the furniture
                        of the Hotel des Illes Britanniques, when spearking about Lord Cromer: -</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Kamel Pasha was sitting in the Hotel des Iles Britanniques. A red
                        fez was on his head; in his hand a pen. He was corresponding for dear life.
                        An intelligent face features lighted by brown eyes and set off by an elegant
                        moustache; a nervous, agile figure. Abigger contrast with the type of
                        conquering Briton could hardly be supposed.</p>
                    <p>Kamel Pasha rose on my entrace and showed an instatn readiness to talk. I
                        explained my business. the agitation in Egypt, the despatch of troops, men
                        in arms kept in reserve in Cairo. The Egyptian laughed a quick laugh. He
                        speaks voluble French and he replied in that language, "Yes; we know the
                        story of the agitation. Pan Islamism serves the purposes of our rulers, but
                        it is not true. There is no agitation, there is no conspiracy. Our movement
                        is an orderly and peaceful manifestation of the national spirit. We have no
                        hatred on the English, as it supposed. We simply say that Lord Cromer, by
                        his treatment of us, is the wrost friend Great Britain could have. He had an
                        admirable opportunity of winning our love, but he has acted as oppressor, as
                        tryant.</p>
                    <p>"What makes his tyranny the harder to bear is that it is always wrapped up in
                        legal forms. Take the case of Denishwai. 'These men have been convicted by
                        the highest tribunal' says Lord Cromer. But what a tribunal. The native
                        judge is a emre functionary; he has no independence; he can be removed at
                        the will of those who palced him there.</p>
                    <p>"The detestable fact in the governance of Egypt is the hypocriny which is
                        over everything. As autocrat or tyrant, recognised as such, simpy imposes
                        his will. Lor Crommer omposes his will just as surely, but through the forms
                        of law. He is an autocrat as great as Adul Hamid, the Tzar, or the
                        Kaiser.</p>
                    <p>"We claim to be treated as human beings, not as slaves, as pieces of
                        furniture" - and the sneaker contemptuously kicked at a chair. "We are
                        constantly being made to feel that we are inferior race. In what way are we
                        inferior . I am sure the fllaheen are as intelligent as the lwoer classes in
                        England and as capabel of self-goverment. We ask for a Constituion for an
                        Egyptian Parliament, such as was promised to us when the regime of the
                        Khedive Twefik was suppressed. For twenty-four years we have waited for that
                        Parliament.</p>
                    <p>The Tutelage of Germany.</p>
                    <p>"Our enemies declare that we are anxious to come under the Ottoman rule, to
                        become, in fact as well as in name, the subjects of the Turk. This is
                        absolutely false. Do you imagine we should wish to palce ourselves under
                        such a Governemnt. Very far from that, I assure you. In the same way, we
                        have no wish to come under the tutelage of Germany. No, no. We wish to
                        remain Egyptians, and not to become Turks, or English or Germans or French,
                        or any other nationality. Our character is the Treaty of London, 1840,
                        establishing our neutraily under the guarantee of Europe. That is the states
                        we wish to have restored to us.</p>
                    <p>"Our position has become ten fold wore since the Anglo-French treaty
                        confirming the BRitish in the occupation of our country. Hre was opportunity
                        to show the Egyptians that the English were determined to carry out their
                        mission with due regard to national sentiment; but, instead of that, they
                        have proved more arrogant than ever. The English never associate with us;
                        they keep always to themselves, and konw nothing of local sentiment.</p>
                    <p>"To show you what the present temper of our rulers is, let me give you an
                        instance. After the Denishwai affair, in which the death penalty was carried
                        out, although medical evidence showed that Captain Bull did not die of his
                        injuries, but of heart-failure through exhaustion, some Greeks set upon two
                        English officers in the streets of Cairo and beat them. They also, beat the
                        police officers charged with inquiring into the affair. For this offence
                        they were sent to their Consulate and sentenced simply to twenty days
                        imprisonment. Observe the difference of treatment in the two cases. It shows
                        that England is checked by the smallest foreign nation covered by the
                        Capitulations, and is only tyrannical towards us, the Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>"It si not singular that Lord Cromer should now be calling loudly for troops
                        when, at the farewell banquet to Mr. Eldon Gorst, he said, "Opposition is
                        broken!"</p>
                    <p>A Centre of Un-British Propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the conversation continied other Egyptians entered the room. It was
                        evident that this little hotel in the Rne de la Paix named, as if by irony.
                        "Les Illes Britanniques," had become a centre of un British propanganda.
                        Each took his share in the general accusation. </p>
                    <p>Said one, an ex-professor: "This question of education is a burning one Under
                        the Khedivial dynasty we had schools which were free to the poor; to day the
                        fellah cannot send his child to school, the fees are too high"</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>Kamel Pasha again took up the threads of conversation. "We make no charge
                        against the personnel character of Lord Cromer. On the contrary, and I have
                        always said it, his private life is irresporachable and his absolute honesty
                        above suspicion. But he has no sympathy with national aspiration. The policy
                        in Egypt is much less liberal than it is in India. One fo the greates faults
                        of Lord Cromer is that he gathers about him unworthy instruments in the
                        csomopolitan populations of Cairo. Some of the Syrians are miserable types
                        and do not represent the Egyptian nation.</p>
                    <p>"Yet though we have many grievances, principally of th emoral order, we are
                        not prejudiced against the English," he protested. "Do I not teach English
                        in my native school at Cairo!" And thus quiantly the conversation ended.</p>

                        much sought after concession to people who did not ask for them gives rise
                        to much commment. It can only be interpreted as showing the Sultan's desire
                        to conciliate these personages, especially when it is remebered that the
                        Minister of Justice represents the Old Turkey Party, and in the Council of
                        Minsiters invariably shows great opposition to all projects for loans,
                        conversion, etc. The Sheik ul Islam is naturally the leader of the religious
                        party, and Zekki Pasha is the representative of the military party. It is
                        generally supposed that this is the first step towards winning over the
                        above to assits the Sultan's scheme for altering the order of the sucession
                        in favour of his son, Burhan eddin.</p>

                    <p>"I could not bear the children to be near me, for the constant struggle to
                        bear such agony as I endured quite qore out my nerves," said Mrs. Jenkins,
                        of 46. Ann-street, Cilfynydd, near Pontypridd. Yet after two years of
                        intense suffering, this lady has foundin Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
                        People not only relief from pain, but a complete restoration of health.</p>
                    <p>"After the birth of one of my children," said Mrs. Jenkins, "I was laid up
                        with rhenmatic fever and became reduced to a terribly weak state. I never
                        exptected to get about again. My legs swelled, and pains shot through my
                        body so acute that I could have screamed out. No medical skill seemed able
                        to help me; for in spite of medicine I grew weaker and weaker. My appetiate
                        left me, I was a white as a sheet, and suffered tortures of indigestion
                        after taking food. For two years I was a complete invalid - helpless, and a
                        burden to everybody. Day after day, I was pillowed up in the same room,
                        incapable of moving. My heart was weak, and I had fainting fits if a knock
                        came at the door.</p>
                    <p>I got into such a low state at last that no one was allowed to visits me. I
                        did not seem to live at all. </p>
                    <p>"Finally a friend told my husband to give me Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
                        Pale People, and he thoughfully bought a box for me.</p>
                    <p>"I took them, merly hoping that they might cease my suffering a little, but I
                        was surpised at the good they did me. The pains were relived and I was
                        encouraged by a feeling of brightness and improved appetite to continue
                        taking them. Gradually I felt more strenght coming, and found myself eating
                        really solid meals, and enjoying food. I had no trace of indigestion, and
                        all pains had long since ceased. Soon I was able to get ourdoor and my
                        former strength came back completely. My recovery after two years of such
                        illness amazed everybody who know me. I am now a strong and active woman
                        again, with no trouble, and able to do my day's work with ease, thanks to
                        Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.</p>
                    <p>"My husband a little time ago had an attack of great weakness, but after
                        taking Dr. Williams' Pink Pills he was soon more robust than ever."</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir. - With great interst I read your leading article in your yesterday's
                            issue under the heading "El Minbar." Every one expected from the
                            proprietors of "El Minbar" a better policy the present situation, owing
                            to their long experience in the journal world. Mr. Hafez Awad cannot
                            blame the Sudan Government for refusing his paper from entering the
                            Sudan, a country which is still in a savage state and under reform. Of
                            course the reforemrs of such a country require a help and not a
                            hindrance to their worthy and hard task. I should like to understand why
                            Mr. Hafez Award does not blame the Turkish Government for refusing
                            nearly al the National Moselm journals of Egypt to enter the Ottoman
                            Empire, and if I am not mistaken the "El Minbar" and "El Lewa" are
                            included. Why do not they ask Mustapha Kamel to show his eloquence in
                            Turkey, or at least to make his way by Stambol on his return to Egypt
                            and then to say what he saw, what he heard, and how he was treated in
                            the Capital and submit it to the general ipinon to compre and judge.</p>
                        <p>With thanks, I remain, Sir, Yours faithfully, </p>
