                            <p>in an audience granted to the American Minister at Tsarkoe Selo the
                                Tsar indicated his willingness to consider the subject of Feace. In
                                his telegram the Minister describes this interview as being a most
                                hopeful one.</p>

                            <p>The Congress of the Zemstvos was composed of 250 delegates. It
                                adopted an emphatically worded address to the Tsar demanding the
                                Convocation of a national assembly to be elected by universal
                                suffrage, in order to decide the question of war or peace, and to
                                abolish the vicious, dangerous, and ignorant bureaucracy.</p>
                            <p>It impresses on the Tsar his responsibility and warns him against any
                                delay. A deputa tion has been appointed to present the address to
                                the Tsar. This address is practically an ultimatum that the country
                                sends to the Throne. The style is equally remarkable. The Tsar is
                                addressed throughout as "you" and the word "Majesty" is entirely
                                wanting. The conventional expressions of "loyalty" and "devo- tion"
                                are also absent. (Reuter.)</p>

                            on Thursday evening, some persons belonging to the same ezbeh destroyed
                            his cotton crops merely because he did not invite them to the wedding.

                            Very fine weather was met with during the whole of the trip with the

                            seen or read about in piscatorial annals was reen. It was basking in the

                            between 25 and 30 feet in length, with a breadth across the nose of 5
                            feet, being of the shovel-nose species. Lots of barnacles were observed

                            extraordinarily big, but such an enormous shark is almost unknown,</p>

                        little damage has been done. He also found that great interest was being

                        exercised, and that the instructions of the inspectors of the Ministry of

                    <p>A serious, collision occurred in Cairo on Thursday between a tram and a cab.
                        The cab, which was occupied by Tewfik Bey Seoudi, a Cairo barrister, was
                        proceeding along the street leading from the Esbekieh to Clot Bey-street and
                        was just turning the corner when it was overtaken by a tram going in the
                        same direction. The driver of the cab shouted loudly to the tramdriver, but
                        the latter appar rently lost his head, for he continued on his way without
                        slackening speed. The force of the collision was considerable and one horse
                        was killed on the spot whilst the other was severely injured. Tewfik Bey
                        Seoudi was thrown from the carriage and was badly bruised and much shaken,
                        but the coachman succeeded in leaping from his seat and escaped injury.</p>

                        noires" by means of which the management of the Théatre des Nouveautés in
                        Cairo endeavours to attract large audiences, and we consider it to be our
                        duty to once more protest against such performances being allowed. The short
                        play which was produced on the stage of the "Nouveautés, at a recent
                        entertainment of this description, was illustrative of the depths to which
                        some artistes can degrade themselves by publicly portraying characters which
                        are repulsive to all right-thinking persons, and it is very regrettable that
                        an audience can be found to lend their support to the presentation of such
                        exhibitions. We have no desire to appear straight-laced or narrow-minded,
                        but we will risk this charge being laid against us, and we feel assured that
                        the great majority of our readers will agree with us in our emphatic
                        protest. We trust that any future announcement of the holding of a soirée
                        noire" by this or any other theatre or music-ball, will cause the Government

                        1882 (despatches, medal with clasp, Khedive's star); Sudan expedition, 1884
                        (despatches twice, two clasps); Nile Expedition 1884-85 (two clasps); Sudan

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Sir, I read the ontspoken
                            criticism on the Egyptian Development Syndicate, which you have
                            reproduced from the "Morning Post" to day, with great interest. Why has
                            there not been more criticism of similar companies, which, unfortunately
                            for their misguided supporters among the public, are not in an embryonic
                            state but have been successfully floated 1 It is surely a matter in
                            which the Egyptian Government should interfere. The stipulations which
                            the Government laid down in the case of mining companies have been of
                            some service in preventing wild speculation in the Egyptian mining
                            market. Cannot the Government also lay down conditions which will
                            prevent the indiscriminate launching of such companies, many of which
                            are only formed for the benefit of the promoters, and to get money from
                            the credulous Egyptian investor, whose speculative instincts invariably
                            overbalance his reasoning capacities? But it is probably asking too much
                            for the Government to interfere, as company promoting appears to be the
                            goal of every Anglo-Egyptian official on leaving the service of the
                            Government. It would be interesting to know who the gentleman is, whose
                            services have been secured by the Egyptian Development Syndi- cate, but
                            whose name is so carefully withheld from publicity. We are told that
                            this gentleman has acquired a thorough knowledge of the requirements of
                            this country during a residence of 25 years. I wonder if he is some
                            ex-Anglo-Egyptian official.-Truly yours, </p>
                        <p>"INVESTOR."</p>
                        <p>Alexandria, June 9.</p>
                        <p>In regard to our correspondent's demand for the interference of the
                            Egyptian Government, we may point out that he fails to distinguish
                            between Egyptian companies and companies formed to do business in Egypt
                            but incorporated abroad, which are wholly independent of any Egyptian
                            authorisation or control. As to the former category it would be apposite
                            to quote Lord Cromer's words from his Report published in 1900 (Egypt
                            No. 1 [1900] p. 32):-</p>
                        <p>..In the second place, I wish to repeat the warning I gave last year, to
                            the effect that, when it is stated that the formation of an Egyptian
                            company has been sanctioned by the Egyptian Government, this only means
                            that the company has conformed to certain conditions laid down by the
                            Government as an essential preliminary to the sanction being given. It
                            does not mean more than this. It does not in any way signify that the
                            Government either approves or disapproves of the special enterprise with
                            which the company is concerned, considered on its own merits. In saying
                            this, I have no wish whatever to discourage native investors. Some
                            projects laid before them will, without doubt, be based on thoroughly
                            sound principles, and will be likely to prove remunerative, others,
                            again, may be of a more doubtful and speculative character. The
                            Government does not undertake to distinguish between these two
                            categories of investments. Its functions are strictly limited to laying
                            down certain conditions, which the experience of other countries has
                            shown to be of a nature calcnlated to protect the interest of investors.
                            The latter have then to decide for themselves, and I should add that the
                            experience of other countries has also shown that no legislative or
                            administrative measures can adequately protect the careless investor.
                            Egyptians, therefore, will do well not to go to the one extreme of
                            exaggerated mistrast of all projects which may be laid before them, or
                            to the other extreme of accepting too hastily the accuracy of any facts
                            and opinions which may be embodied in a prospectus, but to adopt the
                            middle course, which consists in carefully examining for themselves,
                            with the aid of competent friends, the merits of each special proposal,
                            whether it be put forward by Europeans or by their own countrymen.".</p>

                        <head>LOTTERIES IN EGYPT.<lb/>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</head>
                        <p>Sir,-In common with many other Anglo- Egyptians I have up till lately
                            been accustomed to buy now and again in the streets of Cairo a few
                            lottery tickets. I have never gained anything, but feel sufficiently
                            rewarded by the sense of pleasurable expectation which my purchases have
                            afforded me, and have always looked forward with a certain amount of
                            mild excitement to the reading of the winning numbers in the local
                            newspapers. The Egyptian Government has in its wisdom decided that
                            lotteries are immoral and that, as they had been abolished for nearly a
                            century in England, Egypt should also follow in the wake of progress and
                            declare lotteries to be an abomination. Accordingly, we saw the usual
                            machinery put into motion and a short time ago we were given to
                            understand that lotteries were things of the past. The result was that a
                            large number of poor people, who had been accustomed to hawk lottery
                            tickets about the streets, were deprived of their means of subsistence,
                            and some of them who were Jews made a manifestation at the house of Mr.
                            Cattani here. If the English officials, who do guide the destinies, and
                            try also to guide the morals of this country, had been consistent in
                            this matter, there would have been nothing more to say. No doubt
                            lotteries, like many other things in Egypt, are reprehensible and ought
                            to be suppressed. Moreover, to judge from your columns, moral faddists
                            and cranks of every description <cb n="6"/> appear to be increasing in
                            Egypt in these latter days, and their opinions as to the regeneration of
                            Egypt must be attended to. I should be the last to criticise this step
                            but for the inconsistency that has been displayed. For a few weeks the
                            new law against lotteries appeared to be stringently enforced and the
                            sale of the tickets ceased in the streets. But Low the vendors of these
                            tickets have appeared again, and on enquiry I find that the lottery
                            tickets of some benevolent societies are allowed to be sold. The
                            Government has prohibited lotteries and the sale of tickets in public
                            places, because obviously lotteries are injurious to public morality.
                            But it makes an exception in the case of benevolent societies, whose
                            lotteries it authorises! Could anything be more inconsistent ? If
                            lotteries are bad per se, are they a whit less bad if organised by these
                            societies! We may argue then, that although gambling hells and
                            disorderly houses are bad and ought to be suppressed, yet, if run by
                            benevolent societies to enrich their coffers, they can be tolerated as
                            legitimate! There is no disputing the appositeness of the parallel. Why
                            such an exception was allowed I fail to discover, for it is based on
                            that most specious but immoral principle that evil should be permitted
                            if good can come out of it. Who is responsible? The general rule now is
                            to shift responsibility for every abuse in Egypt on to the
                            Capitulations, but I cannot see where the Capitulations come in here, so
                            the prevalent principle of official irresponsibility, "When in doubt,
                            abuse the Capitulations," does not hold good in this case. It would be
                            interesting to discover who was responsible for this exception, which
                            the flimsiest casuistry cannot justify. I am, etc., </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir,-My letter in your issue of
                            April 1 causes the Bishop of Pennsylvania to remark of the overturn of
                            the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, that "the action of
                            the London Committee is amusing." Allow me now to quote his entire
                            letter to me: "My dear Dr. Winslow: I have read your pamphlet, The Truth
                            about the Egypt Exploration Fund,' with deep, and painful interest. It
                            has the charm of a well-told detective story, but its revelations of
                            ambition and. deceitfulness on the part of others with whom you were
                            associated, are painful. The action of the London Committee is amazing.
                            The Fand owes far more to you than to ary one else who has been
                            connected with it, and I feel sure that if all the facts could be put
                            before a full meeting of the Committee, there would be a reconsideration
                            of the unjust action affecting your relationship to the organisa tion. I
                            wish I could hope for a reconsideration of the action of some persons in
                            Boston, but I fear they will find no place for repentance. "I shall
                            certainly not renew my subscription to the Fund so long as the present
                            organisation of the American Branch remains unchanged.-Faithfully
                            yours., </p>
                        <p>O. W. WHITAKER."</p>
                        <p>The London Committee should try to atone for "the enormous blunder" by
                            reparation of some kind to the 600 or 700 American subscribers, to the
                            corps of 80 local secretaires, and to myself as their head official.
                            Thus, with confidence restored, there would be strong hope for a renewal
                            of large financial support.- Yours faithfully,</p>

                    <head>TRADE IN THE SUDAN</head>
                    <head>NEW ROUTES TO ABYSSINIS</head>
                    <p>It is interesting to observe the various li stages in the colonisation of a
                        country like the Sudan. Two very interesting accounts of the zeul and
                        enterprise showa in opening up trade and trade routes to Abyssinia bure just
                        come to hand. One is that of Captain Wilson, until recently the Inspector of
                        Kodok Province ; the other is that of Mr. Jesser, an agent of the wealthy
                        American, Mr. Mar. millan, who takes a great interest in explor ing on the
                        Sudan frontier</p>
                    <p>Captain Wilson's object was to increase the trade with Soathern Abyssinia by
                        the waterways of the White Nile and Sobat Rivers. Menelik had given the
                        Sudan Govern. ment a trading station at Etang, on the Baro River, but, for
                        some reason or other, this had been a failure, and Captain Wilson's inain
                        idea was to find out the reasons for this, and, if possible, remove the
                        obstacles. Together with the representatives of the leading trading houses
                        at Khartoum, Captain Wilson arrived at Etang and almost immediately found
                        the causes of lack of trade. The station w39 unsuitable and not on the trade
                        road. The Egyptian merchants bad not chosen quite the merchandise required,
                        and asked exorbitant prices, and the chief men of the district had put every
                        obstacle in the way of trade. Besides this there had been fighting amongst
                        themselves. It was found that the object of the traders was not to gain and
                        establish regalar trade, but to make as much as they could in one swoop
                        before the natives could find out the true value, and then to retire with
                        the cash. One agent openly declared that he withdrew his goods because he
                        could not make 100 per cent. profit, expecting that the Abyssinians were
                        like the negro tribes, the Dinkas and the Shillaks, who were at first
                        porsuaded to part with their goods for a few beads.</p>
                    <p>Captain Wilson at once proceeded to look out for a new station, and steamed
                        ap the Baro to the place where it is joined by the River Jaijebbs, and fixed
                        on a site for a market at Finkio, a village which is above high-water mark,
                        free from swamps, and on the trade road between Abyssinis and the country of
                        the Anyoks. He then determined to visit all the "babe," or trade doors, in
                        the district, and find out why they were closed. Saio was the first place
                        visited, and the nephew of the headman Jots, as is the custom, showed the
                        party every hospitality. He insisted on the dismissal of the negro carriers,
                        as he had strict orders to see that the goods were carried by his own men.
                        The boa iman Takallin was evidently afraid of trading, and complained of the
                        prices of the Egyptian traders. For some reason or other he bad closed the
                        door to trade, and very reluctantly admitted that he had received orders
                        from his chief, Rss Tesemma, ordering him to open the road.</p>
                    <p>The next place visited was Gore, the city of Ras Tesemma. The Ras was away at
                        Addis Abeba, it was said, building a house for himself at the capital, but
                        his representative expressed bimself pleased with the choice of the new
                        trading station. One of the days of the visit being market day, a
                        proclamation was made to the people, telling them that trade was to be
                        encouraged, and that the door was open. One of the merchants with Captain
                        Wilson exposed his goods for sale, and in a very short time disposed of the
                        whole lot to the value of £50. Contracts were made for coffee and bees'-wax
                        on the spot, and there is no doubt the chances of trade are excellent, and
                        supply and demand heavy for fair exchange. During the stay of the expedition
                        &amp; party of merchants arrived from 28 far off as Massowah t) trade in
                        coffee and ! boes' wax. Şurely if it is worth their while to koop op al
                        trade from such a distance, the merchants from Khartoum, with ever ought to
                        be successful in competing with them.</p>
                    <p>There is little doubt that Captain Wilson's timely visit has had the desired
                        effect. The merchants are now busy collecting the kind of merchandise needed
                        for exchange, and the Abyssinians are very quick to dispose of their prodace
                        if only the doors are kept open. There is a great demand in those parts for
                        swords, not less than 3ft. lin. curved or straight, without handles, as the
                        natives prefer putting on their own hilts. Evidently a good many of these
                        are made in England ; one examined closely was marked "Manufacture Garanti,
                        London." Baamelled iron drinking-cops, 4) ins. high, blue or white, would
                        find a ready sale, as would enamelled iron teapots of the cheapest quality.
                        All these swords, cups and teapots ought to be stamped with Monelik's crest.
                        The chiet produce of this part of Abyssinia is coffee and bees'-wax and a
                        certain amount of ivory, but as the tribute of the local chiefs is paid in
                        that article, and monopolized by them, very little trade can be done in that
                        line. The whole district is a great grain-grow ing region, and has great
                        possibilities for trad. if the roads are kept open. In his report Captain
                        Wilson was able to say: "The roads are now fally open to trade and all
                        obstacle removed."</p>
                    <p>The main object of Mr. Jesren's expeditio was to find a roata for trade with
                        Abys. ginis having an outlet on the White Nile. Starting from Melat, &amp;
                        lace about 30 milonorth of Kodok (Pasbord.). Mr. Jessen's parts struck
                        inland on March 9th, and marched or the north bank of Kor Adar. In high Nile
                        thix stream flows fall into the main river, but in the dry senson, except
                        for pools here and there, the bed is dry. Mr. Jessen traced the bed of the
                        Kbor until he came to swampy ground, and by the vegetation and trees along
                        the banks as far as his eye could trace it thr Khor tan ronth and then due
                        enst. In the pools were hundreds of hippe, with sufficien! water to cover
                        only • few, and game of al porta drinking at the pools. During the raius
                        womon there must be &amp; deep and strong por:</p>
