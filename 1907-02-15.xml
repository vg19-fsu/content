                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can

                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be

                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Dicey's new book, "Egypt of the Future," comes in for some severe
                        criticism in the London Press. The "Evening Standard" remarks: From Mr.
                        Edward Dicey, whose wide knowledge based on intimate study and long
                        experience, entitles him to speak with real authority on Egyptian questions,
                        we should have expected a book more clear, concise, and, we venture to say,
                        reasonable than this "Egypt of the Future." A pessimist, he not only
                        distrusts the present administration, but regards with keen anxiety the
                        future that we have to face. Yet his criticisms of Lord Cromer's benevolent
                        autocracy seem far from convincing, while the solution that he offers, or
                        seems to offferfor he makes no definite statements or proposals on his own
                        accountseems self-contradictory. It is the acknowledged and advertised
                        British Protectorate for which he yearns with a passionate feeling that may
                        have tended to warp cool judgement. Yet he opposes manfully the proposals
                        put forward by Lord Cromer's for con <cb n="6"/>

                        France into a genuine reality by the abolition of the capitulatoins, the
                        mixed tribunals, and the other anomalies that were the product of an
                        irregular situation. Call it a Protectorate and Mr. Dicey would be
                        satisfied. But the fact without the title fills him with an apprenhension
                        which is, we hope, almost morbid. He girds at Lord Cromer also for having
                        taken the reins of Egyptian government into his capable hands, and
                        concentrated the power in a class of British officials who alone have
                        succeeded in making the desert fruitful, in relieving the people of
                        monstrous burdens, in bringing Egypt from the verge of bankruptcy to
                        solvency and prosperity, in spreading civilisation, progress, and
                        well-being. He would like to see Egypt governed practically by Egyptians
                        under some scheme "best fitted to render our Protectorate more congenialor
                        perhaps I should say less uncongenial to the Egyptian public than that which
                        has hitcherto been adopted by the British Agency." Yet he is very sensible
                        of the perils of fanatical unrest, he supports entirely the necessary
                        severity in suppressing such incidents as the Denishwai affair, and warns us
                        that Islam will always be opposed to Christendom, and that we must hold
                        Egypt, they key to India, by military occupation. It is very difficult to
                        reconcile these conflicting sentiments. It is surely unreasonable to blame a
                        man in one and the same breath for the blindness which has permitted a
                        dangerous licence to the native Press and the dissemination of political
                        discontent, and for an obstinate disinclination to share authority with
                        Egyptian officials. What kind of an Egypt Mr. Dicey desires is far from
                        clear. His Protectorate would presumbly be somewhat autocratic. Yet his
                        aspirations are towards autonomy. His book is, in fact, a puzzle so far as
                        the Egypt of the future is concerned, and gices us little light and no
                        leading.</p>
                    <p>As a prophet we cannot understand him; as a critic of the present
                        administration we find him quite unconvincing. It may be that it is to the
                        influence of Nubar Pasha, "the one great statesman, Egyptian or European, I
                        have ever known in Cairo," that may be traced the diversity of views that
                        seems so inconsistent. But it is not probable or possible that confidence in
                        Lord Cromer should be thus shaken, though and impetus may well be given to
                        independent study of the problems of Egypt.</p>

                    <head>POSITION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY.</head>
                    <p>Speaking broadly, Lancashire spinners and manufactueres are at the opening of
                        February more deeply sold than at the close of 1906, but in weaving the
                        margin of profit is less than perhaps at any time during the past two years.
                        This applies only to weavers who do not spin their own yearn. The firms who
                        have both spindles and loom are doing very well indeed, and our best outlook
                        for cotton piece goods is India, notably Calcutta. The raw cotton crop there
                        is likely to be about 5,000,000 bales, or a good deal larger than any
                        previous season. This will mean that users on the Continent will not need to
                        buy American kinds of the raw material to makeup for a shortage in Surat and
                        the like. There is every possibility, the "Globe's" Manchester correspondent
                        points out, of a much larger supply of raw cotton for the use of the world
                        than was ever known. An interesting feature this is larger growth of
                        Egyptian cotton this season of excellent quality. Bolton yarns of fine

                        of the railway line. This route would tap the trade of the Congo Free State
                        and bring much traffic to the Uganda railway. The cultivation of cotton is
                        being enthusiastically taken up by the chiefs and other large landowners in
                        Uganda. The exports already amount to 25 tons a week, and the output will
                        assume very large proportions. The cultivation offers great opportunities
                        for the profitable investment of capital in Uganda. Land can be purchased at
                        a very moderate rate, and labour is plentiful and cheap.</p>

                    <p>Port Tewfik, Thursday. A very serious fight took place in the Suez Canal
                        between Syrian and Tarkish soldiers on board the Turkish troopship Hodeidab,
                        bound to Hodeidah with reinforcements. The outcome of it was that 300 men
                        escaped by jumping into the Canal, several of them being shot and drowned.
                        In addition to this, 17 soldiers were seriously wounded, and on arrival at
                        Suez were landed at the quarantine pier for conveyance to Hospital.</p>

                    <head>FATHY BEY ZAGHLOUL.</head>
                    <p>Since the departure of Mr. Robertson, M.P., from Egypt the great topic in the
                        vernacular Press has been the appointment of Fathy Bey Zaghloul, and columns
                        and columns' are being written on the subject. Sayid Hassan Moussa el-Akkad,
                        the well-known Cairo Nationalist, in a letter to "Al Minbar" on the subject,
                        declares that the attack on Fathy Bey is pointless, and he ought not to be
                        criticised for his share in the Danishwai trial, for he cannot be considered
                        in any way responsible for the severe sentence. It is well known, says the
                        writer, that the scaffold was made ready for the Denishwai executions before
                        the special court met. "I, for my part," he continues, "would not oppose the
                        appointment of a native to a high position, even though the appointment be
                        made for the purpose of withdrawing him from 'us,' as appears to be the case
                        in this instance. It is far better to leave Fathy Bey to 'them' and try to
                        gain over his heart and sympathy."</p>

                    <head>SCENE AT GREEK PATRIARCHATE.</head>
                    <p>The Orthodox Patriarchal Palace of Alex. andria was yesterday afternoon the
                        scene of unwonted commotion for so usually solemn a place. From what can be
                        gathered it appears that a Greek woman, Kyriaki by name, in the domestic
                        employ of an English family of Ibrahimieb, had gone to the Patriarchate to
                        obtain a decree nisi against her husband, Yoannis Marinitis. Her movements
                        had, however, been watched by her husband, who with a trio of Greek
                        stalwarts, had closely pursued her to the Patriarchate, and before she could
                        reach the registration offi e the men had rushed up the stairway and seized
                        her. She screamed for help, and her ories brought the custodian to her
                        assistance, but he was overpowered and before help could come. Kyriaki was
                        forced into a carriage and driven rapidly away. Since then the Patriarchal
                        officials have ordered a search to be made for her; it is believed that she
                        has been taken to her brother-in-law's. There were several witnesses to this
                        extraordinary abduotion, but not knowing the cause thereof they did not care
                        to intervene.</p>
                    <p>Yoannis Marinitis is a Soiote, a mason by trade, and he married Kyriaki a
                        year and a half ago on that Island. As he took to drink she separated from
                        him about nine months ago, and had since then been in the employ of this
                        English family. Both are rayahs, or Ottoman subjects, and Orthodox
                        Greeks.</p>

                        steamer on the Nile, which was awaiting him. After an hour, on board, he,
                        accompanied by Mr. Hazell, drove to the Mondirish. The Adviser inspect ed
                        the Moudirieh and visited the different offices. He also inspected Keneh
                        Markaz, and the prison, which he described as an industrial school owing to
                        the work done by the prisoners. He lunched with the Moudir and afterwards

                    <p>Signa. Berlendi scored another big success in "Carmen," of which the second
                        performance was given yesterday. At the risk of repeating ourselves, we must
                        again express our admiration for a most painstaking and entirely successful
                        reading of this ardoons role. Not only was Signa. Berlendi's acting
                        convincing in every detail, but her vocal efforts were proof of her having
                        thoroughly mastered the part. Sig. de Marchi's Don José was also well-nigh
                        faultless; both vocally and dramatically be showed his usual taste and
                        refine. ment, He might with advantage have let himself go a little more in
                        the first two acts, bat he was perfect in the latter half of the opera.
                        Despite these two excellent achievements, the general result obtained was
                        not so good as on Friday last, and for this the orchestra were chiefly
                        responsible; throughout Aots I. and IV. and during most of Act III. there
                        was a want of firmness and spirit. We wish it were realised that vigour is
                        not to be obtained by more unbalanced speed. Sig. Dalbore, as Escamillo,
                        also laboured under this delusion to a certain extent and can hardly be Baid
                        to have fulfilled requirements. Signa. Finzi's Micaela was skilfully and
                        fervently executed; her methods are rather old-fashioned, but all the same
                        very pleasing and suave. The chorus again acquitted themselves very well. In
                        short, "Carmen" is one of the best given of this season's opera, as last
                        night's fall and enthusiastic house amply acknowledged. The opera will be
                        given again to-night.</p>

                        in front of goal, thereby giving the Reds a shot at goal from which they
                        scored the winning</p>

                        exciting game, the Reds ultimately winning by 4 goals to 3. For the winners,
                        Capt. Rome played a brilliant game, and Mr. Reid was fairly sure at back,.
                        but seemed to take a long time turning. For the losers, Capt. Bartlett
                        played splendidly and with a little straighter shooting at goal would have
                        won the match for his side. We look forward to a most interesting final

                    <head>CONCERT AT THE SAVOY.</head>
                    <p>There has been such a remarkable dearth of concerts in Cairo this season that
                        that given by the Marquis Francesco Filiasi and Maestro Vincenzo Cantabi at
                        the Savoy on Wednesday was warmly welcomed both for its novelty and for the
                        intrinsic charm of its programme. It is th the first appearance of both of
                        these artists in Cairo; but they are well known in Naples and have many
                        friends here, including the Count and Countess of Zogheb and the
                        Paravicini's; and it is to be hoped that we may have many other
                        opportunities of deepening the impression they made upon their first
                        appearance among us. The Marquis Francisco Filiasi is a very sympathetic and
                        graceful pianist, and both as soloist and accompanist displayed a charming
                        touch and facility. He also played some of his own compositions, his
                        "Novelletta" and "Mazarka" much merit no little</p>
                    <p>Maestro Vincenzo Cantani, the violinist, is possessed of a very fine
                        technique and purity of feeling, his playing is singularly correct and
                        facile, but his performance on Wednesday was so restrained as to be lacking
                        in the fire and sympathy necessary to arouse the enthusiasm of his audience.
                        In his last appearance, when he rendered Wieniawsky's delightful "Fantaisie
                        sur Faust," he certainly showed a power of expression which we hope to feel
                        intensified on his next appearance, and which showed that the coldness of
                        his earlier performances was more due to the novelty of his surroundings
                        than any lack of feeling.</p>
                    <p>We were glad to see that a very fairly numerous and appreciative audience had
                        gathered to welcome these new artists, though as usual the pleasure of a
                        certain portion was much disturbed by the ill-advised condact of a few
                        well-known residents who chose to continue an entirely unnecessary con-
                        versation during the first half of the programme. It is not the first time
                        we have had to dwell upon the thoughtless so'fishness of those who choose to
                        disturb their neighbours in this manner, and we can only hope that if these
                        lines meet the eyes of the offenders they will endeavour in future to keep
                        their conversation for a more appropriate occasion.</p>

                        now being repaired at Port Said of the damage she sustained in her recent
                        mishap.</p>
                    <p>The latest London papers bring the news of the death of General Sir Archibald
                        Alison, whose name will long be remembered in Egypt for the share he took in
                        suppressing Arabi When Arabi Pasha's rebellion occurred in 1889, immediately
                        after the bombardment of Alex. andria, General Alison arrived in Egypt. With
                        at first a very small force, including marines and sailors landed by Sir
                        Beauchamp Seymour from the fleet, under 5,000 men, he took over the
                        occupation and defence of Alexandria. Order was speedily restored, the forts
                        oconpied, and the Egyptian army, which had retired a few miles to escape the
                        cannon of the fleet, sat down and menaced the city. In a short time Sir
                        Archibald, with a mere handful of troops marched out from Moharrem Bey Gate
                        cleared the enemy out of Ramleh, and invited the "Arabists" to come oat from
                        their works at Kafr Dawar and accept battle in front of Melahah Janction.
                        And there were several brisk skirmishes when the honours were with our
                        troops, the left of which rested upon historic ground, where Aberorobie
                        fought and fall.</p>
                    <p>It was in these scorching, hard working days that Captain John Fisher, now
                        First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet, organised and fought the
                        armour-clad train, and Alison and everybody so repeatedly "trailed their
                        coats" to get a stand-up fight out of Arabi and his men, When the great
                        turning movement was made by Wolseley to Ismailia, General Alison led the
                        Highland Brigade at Tel el Kebir. He was in front of his men on that trying
                        night march of Sept. 13. 1882, and at their head just as dawn was coming.
                        Sword in hand, he showed them the way to the "Arabist" forts, works, and
                        trenches, and roaring, "Charge!" still as leader struck like an irresistible
                        avalanche of steel and blood the astounded Egyptians. Cheering and yelling,
                        the Highlanders swept over the enemies' works, thrusting all opposition
                        aside with their bayonets. The grand, picturesque soldier scrambled to the
                        parapet of one of the forte, and from there gave directions that helped to
                        secure the swiftest and most decisive victory of all modern wars.
                        Subsequently Sir Archibald was for about a year in command of the troops
                        left in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS</p>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes set forth in the Memorandum of
                        Association to carry on business in Egypt, the Sudan and Cyprus, and more
                        particularly to at once acquire certain Freehold Land situate at Ghezireh
                        near Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The Directors have been fortunate in securing a plot of land of about 10,000
                        square metres forming part of the Estate of the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, and
                        known as the Harem Buildings, situated at the immediate approach to the new
                        Boulac Bridge at Ghezireh and having a large frontage on the new tramway
                        route which will lead direct to the Pyramids. Upon completion of the Bridge,
                        passengers will be able to take a tram from the centre of Cairo over the New
                        Bridge direct to the Pyramids and there is no doubt that when this important
                        work is finished, there will be a great augmentation of passenger and
                        vehicular traffic to and from the Pyramids and Ghizireh.</p>
                    <p>This Company has secured the valuable and sole Monopoly of being able to
                        build shops on the estate, therefore all the trade in this rapidly rising
                        Suburb must necessarily be confined to those who have the privilege of
                        becoming tenants or purchasers of the plots. The Company has also secured
                        the right to build shops and houses to a height of 20 metres this being 2
                        metres higher than the height allowed to any previous purchasers, which is a
                        privilege of considerable value to this Company.</p>
                    <p>The Ghezireh Estate was owned by the late Khedive, Ismail Pacha, who built
                        the present Palace and made it his principal residence. It is now the
                        property of the "Egyptian Hotels Limited" and is called the Ghezireh Palace
                        Hotel , which is one of the most luxurious Hotels to be found anywhere.</p>
                    <p>The property to be purchased, besides the advantages stated above of being
                        opposite the approach to the new Boulac Bridge, has the most delightful
                        surroundings, being situated in the centre of the well-known Ghezireh
                        Gardens, adjoining which are the Khedivial Sporting Club, the Race course
                        and the Grotto. This district is already a fashionable quarter for the
                        wealthy classes and the increased facilities of access from Cairo must
                        necessarily tend to increase the residential population.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto no villas have been erected at lower rentals than L250 to L300 per
                        annum and permission was given to build on only 1/3rd of the area of each
                        plot, in consequence of which and also owing to the difficulty of access to
                        and from Cairo, the cost of living in the neighbourhood has been very
                        high.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Hotels Company, Limited, being desirous of developing their
                        Estate as rapidly as possible and with a view to providing increased
                        facilities to Residents, have granted to this Company the sole right to
                        erect shops as well as houses. The building of these shops should ensure a
                        considerable increase in the number of Residents and be of great advantage
                        to the neighborhood, and a substantial source of revenue to the Company.</p>
                    <p>Applications for Shares should be made on the accompanying form and forwarded
                        with cheque for the amount payable on application to the Company's Bankers.
                        If no allotment is made, the application money will be returned in full, and
                        where the number of shares allotted is less than that applied for the
                        surplus will be credited in reduction to the amount payable on allotment,
                        and any excess will be returned to the Applicant.</p>
                    <p>Failure to pay any installment when due will render the previous payments
                        liable to be forfeited.</p>
                    <p>The minimum subscription upon which the Directors may proceed to Allotment
                        has been fixed by the Articles of Association at £70,000.</p>
                    <p>A brokerage of three pence per Share will be paid to Brokers on all Shares
                        applied for and allotted to the public on Application, Forms bearing their
                        stamps.</p>

                    <p>Le Caire, Jeudi 14 Fevrier 1907. Le taux de l'escompte libre a Londres se
                        tient a 4 3/4, en attendant une neuvelle reduction, car on prevoit que la
                        Banque d'Angleterre ne tardera pas a abaisser son taux a 4 1/2, voire a 4%.
                        Le bilan hebdomadaire publie avant-hier par cette institution montre, en
                        effet, une amelioration marquante: la re serve des billets s'est accrue de
                        £1,076,000 et l'encaisse de £224,000. La proportion de la reserve aux
                        engagements s'est eleves a 49 5/8 pour cent.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In chosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>This depends party upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co's steamers, which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is machto interest the
                        visitor The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a
                        fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all
                        over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
                        interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by
                        Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when
                        Archimedes was slain- his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an
                        ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the
                        capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest is
                        to be found in this fine city The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic orgin and
                        close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Erimiti with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay- Castellamare and Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to
                        Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding county. In Florence itself the chruchs
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promendares and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). — The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                        with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                        cities and a phenomenally equable temperature— warm in winter and
                        deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                        Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble calumns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santa
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern ltaly before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs
                        change trains at Borgo San Dumino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, Bibby and Henderson

                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
