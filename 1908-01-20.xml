                    <p>"Negotiations are in progress whereby it is contemplated that the "Times"
                        newspaper shall be fornel into a limited company under the proposed
                        chairmanship of Mr. Wa ter.. "The newspaper, as heretofore, will published
                        at Printing House-square The business management will be reorganised by Mr.
                        C. Arthur Pearson, the proposed managing director. "The editorial character
                        of the paper will remain unchanged, and will be conducted, as in the past,
                        on lines independent of party politics. The contemplated arrangements will
                        in all probability require the sanction of the Court before they become
                        definitive," . 80 ans quite sensational notice in the "Times" on Tuesday,
                        Jan. 7. "How earth's strong pillars sbake! is the exclamation that barsts
                        naturally from the lip as the astonishing rumour passed from one to another
                        that "Pearson has bought the "Times!'" wrote Mr. W. T. Stead in the
                        "Chronicle." "The story yesterday was a fable, but it had some snbstratum of
                        truth But the circulation - the legend gave us all a sickening shoek. The
                        "Times" has so long been a national institu ion that to hear about it being
                        sold depresses mis as would the report that the Crown jewels had been pawned
                        or that Windsor Castle had been let for a first class hotel." "The Times."
                        "the bus, bloody and brutal Times' of O'Connell's savage invective, is still

                        century ago," pontinues Mr. Stead. "To maintain the "Times" in existence as
                        the authentio and trustworthy chronicler of the Debates in Parliament, of
                        the proceedings in the Law Courts, and of the progress of the world's
                        history at home and abroad, is an object for which I for one would willingly
                        vote an annual subsidy from the National Excequer. No other newspaper even
                        aspires to fill its place. It is unique, solitary and indispensable. We can
                        imagine England without its House of Lords, or even London without its Lord
                        Major, but we cannot grasp the thought of England without the "Times." ! In
                        1901 Mr. Walter, who still controls the "Times," made this announcement:
                        "The control of the "Times" has been in my hands for a good many years past,
                        it is there now. And there it will remain until events over which mortals
                        have no control shall place it in the bands of my successor No outside
                        influence of any kind, of any origin will ever be permitted to affect the
                        character of the great institution which was founded by my great grandfather
                        120 years ago, and which has never for a moment passed from the control of
                        his lineal saccessors." The special interest of the proposed changes centres
                        in the way in which they may affect the policy of the "Times." As Mr. Stead
                        points out, two months ago the "Times" gave a plain bint "to the Tariff
                        Reformers to bury what Disraeli called the dead and damned' corpse of
                        Protection out of sight," and this may have "provoked the internal
                        revolution that has led to the establishment of Mr. Pearson as controller of
                        Printing House-square For Mr. Pearson was fir-t chairman of the Tariff
                        Reform League, and it is assumed that whatever may be he political
                        significatice of the late obscure shuffle, it is meant to rivet the bold of
                        the Protretio ists upon the "Times." The advent of Mr. Pearson as managing
                        director will be followed by a thorough reorganisation of the paper, and Mr.
                        Pearson will play an important part in directing the for tones of the
                        reorganised paper." says the Mail' "It is expected that Mr Moberly Bell, who
                        has, as assista t manager, been no intimately associated with the recent
                        activities of the "Times," will shortly retire. "We understand," adds the
                        Mail, that Sir Alexander Henderson, late Liberal Union ist M.P., Wet

                        which are about to take place in connection with the "Times" new-paper. Mr.
                        Pearson writes to the "Westminster Gazette' to say that he is not acting for
                        any party, whether of Tariff Reformers or other wise, "but it seems to be
                        generally conceded. says that paper, that Mr. Pearson's con nection with the
                        "Times" will make it more than ever a Tariff Reform journal." Mr. Cyril

                        weekly publishing business of C. Arthur Pear son, Limited, who has crowned a
                        successful business career by securing the control of the "Times," is

                        was born in 1850, and created a baronet in 1909. He is distinguished as the

                        served on the Royal Commission on Civil Service Superannuation. He is
                        largely interested in South American railways and in the coal and iron

                        Register." It assumed its present title in 1788. Its founder was an under
                        writer at Lloyd's. For an attack on George III's son he was imprisoned for a
                        year, and stood in the pillory for an hour and fined £50. In 1803 the second
                        John Walter took pontrol; in 1844 the third John Walter, and in 1894 the
                        fourth John Walter, the present controller. The "Times'" greatest editor was
                        Delane, who edited the paper from 1841 to 1877. "Delane went every where and
                        knew everyth ing and everyone," says the "Mail". "He secured such prestige
                        for his journal that it was constantly used as a channel of communication
                        with the public by the British and foreiga Governments. In 1877 he retired,
                        and was succeeded by Professor Chenery, to whom, again, succeeded in 1884

                            of the Garayariyeh Canal which runs through that town. A "Sadd" has been
                            put in near the railway line to Mansourah, as a bridge is being built,
                            and this has cut off the running water. All through the town the water
                            is stagnant, quite black, and of a most unbealthy and objectionable
                            odour, and yet none of those who receive comparatively high salaries to
                            attend to such matters are apparently aware the facts-if they are, they
                            are guilty of gross and unpardonable breach of duty. To add to the
                            natural stagnancy of the water the natives make the canal a recipient

                        on behalf of the league for his presence among them, and for the sympathy

                        and these reforms were most urgently needed. There was the question of
                        educational reform, the questions of a university, public libraries, and
                        numberless others no less pressing, and also the all important question of
                        representative Government.</p>
                    <p>The Government had, be continued, promised to prepare the way to
                        self-Government but in spite of all promises it bad continued in a policy
                        which was little less than despotic, and which made Egypt a dependency of
                        Great Britain Speaking of Lord Cromer, Shiekh Aly Youssef declared that the
                        policy which he had followed of working the country with English heads and
                        Egyptian hands had really resulted. in the breaking of the hands which
                        served him He urged the enlarging of provincial powers. and said that a
                        beginning should be made with the Legislative Council, which, with the
                        General Assembly, was of immense importance to the conntry</p>
                    <p>The leaders remarks were punctuated with repeated bursts of cheering which
                        was sustained for some moments upon his resuming his seat</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ratherford in replying expressed his heartful thanks and gratitude for
                        the bonour done him in entertaining him at such a splendid banquet and for
                        the far too flattering and generous terms in which they had spoken of his
                        efforts in Parliament on bebalf of Egypt. He could assure then that he was
                        constrained by a high sense of duty to visit their country and that his
                        great desire was to study their problems, so that he might be able to render
                        good service both to Egypt and to England and thus bring about the bappiest
                        relations between the two conntries. His reception by H. H. the Khedive, by
                        Ministers, Advisers, officials, and non officials, by men of all parties and
                        by those who attached theinselves to no party bad been of the pleasantest
                        and most cordial character, and he should always re. member with delight and
                        joy their exceeding kindness. He was struck with the besnty | and the
                        beneficence of the Nile with the fertility of their soil, with the glory of
                        their climate, giving health and bappiness to millions with the relies of
                        their ancient civilization, and most of all with the sober, industrious, and
                        happy disposition of their people. The sun seemed to have entered into the
                        inner most recesses of their hearts, bringing a joy and a peace that no man
                        could rob them of, and that the world would not take away. or course he had
                        seen a good deal to distress hiu as well. The presence of Europeans was not
                        an unmixed blessing to Egypt. The attendant evils and vices were a menace to
                        their simple life, to their moral welfare and to their evolution in the path
                        of progress. He hoped that in imbibing what was best in European
                        civilization, they would avoid what was base and degrading. Great and
                        impottant reforms were urgently needed in education, sanitation, land
                        tenure, liceusing, lunaey, the administra tion of justice and in local,
                        municipal pro vincial, and national government. The dis cussion of these
                        reforms the speaker reserved to the House of Commons.</p>
                    <p>It was an infinite pleasure to him to find the new spirit of civic and
                        national patriotism steadily rising in their midst. Without this spirit all
                        their financial progress was as sand in the desert, barren and without
                        beauty. Man does not live by bread alone, and the people who are content
                        with bational prosperity alone are of all pe ple the most miserable and the
                        most to be pitied on the face of the earth. History was strewn with the
                        wrecks of empires and nations, which had no bigher ideal:</p>
                    <p>With regard to their patriotic aims there. fore he was in heaty sympathy. He
                        trusted all political parties alike would pursue constitu tional and
                        reasoned methods in advancing their just cause. Angry and revolutionary
                        tacties had a kuack of recoiling upon those who indulged in them, and wbat
                        was still more unfortunate in retarding the wheels of progress. By subduing
                        racial religious jealousy, by reforming social customs restrictive of
                        liberty and justice, by affording equal opportunity to all, by personal and
                        national sacrifice alone would they emancipate their country. England's
                        mission in Egypt, as far as he could see, was twofold. First to enable
                        Egyptians (and' by Egyptians be meant all who adopted Egyptian nationality)
                        to steer their own ship, and secondI ly, when they were managing their own
                        country, <cb n="3"/> to protect them from all invaders. No more glorious
                        service could be given by a strong nation to a weak nation rightly
                        struggling to be free To this noble end he hoped his country. men both in
                        Egypt and in England would beod their energies, and to this end he and those
                        associated with him would devote their lifelong efforts</p>
                    <p>Dr. Rutherford's speech, which was translated sentence by sentence, met with
                        repeated applause, and apparently fully satisfied the expectations of the
                        audience. Beveral other speeches followed in the same strain, and M Khalil
                        Zeine, Editor of "Al-Massawar" in replying to the toast "our guests"
                        affirmed that the Egyptians would be assured of the support of the Syrians
                        in this movement. The following telegram was received by Dr. Rutherford
                        during the evening :</p>

                        Development and Exploration Company has he said, made good progress during

                        October 31st, 1907, having amounted to LB 23,148, as against LE 17,470 for
                        the preceding year. In the New Egyptian Company we have, thanks to the
                        excellent management of Mr. Beresford, who superintends the reclamation
                        works which that company is conducting on the Nile, good reason to be
                        satisfied with this department of the business. We bave, in these reclaimed
                        lands alone, an asset of a value aquivalent to the bulk of the New Bgyptian
                        Company's capital. The company, during the early part of the year, realised
                        several of its properties and paid us a dividend of 10 per cent., but later
                        the depression existing all over the world spread to Bgypt, where there bas
                        been a great deal of over speculation, and the result has been that shares
                        of all kinds have been thrown on the market, and those of the New Egyptian
                        Company have also reached a market price far below their intrinsic value. We
                        do not doubt that we have in this company not only a good asset but also a
                        business in which we shall probably share from time to time when things

                    <p>REPLY TO CRITICS</p>
                    <p>The Earl of Cromer in his speech at the dinner of the Glasgow Unionist Free
                        Trade Club, on Friday week, replied to the criticisms which had been passed
                        on his speech in London, more especially with regard to the Egyptian Customs
                        duties, summary of his remarks appearing in our cable on the 11th. We are
                        now able to give his statement in full on this point</p>
                    <p>There is" he said "one other criticism to which I should wish to allode
                        briefly. It has been stated that although I may be a freetrader in England,
                        I approved of a protec tionist policy in Egypt. This is a purely personal
                        argument. Had I been ever so proteetionist in Egypt I do not see that the
                        fact would help the tariff reformers much, although it might show that I was
                        guilty of inconsistenoy. But, in fact, although I do not say that the
                        present Rgyptian practices as regards both Customs and Excise duties are
                        everything I could wish, the fiscal policy adopted of recent years in Egypt,
                        so far from bearing the smallest resemblance to protection, bas on all
                        essential points been based on free-trade prin cipiles. I will state the
                        facts briefly. At the commencement of the British occupation an 8 per cent.
                        "ad valorem" Customs duty was imposed on all goods coming into the country.
                        Also, in all the towns, and even in many of the principal villages an octroi
                        duty of 9 per cent. was levied on local produce. The latter pressed far more
                        bardly on the population, and especially on the poorer classes, than the
                        Customs duty. It has been completely abolished. Moreover, the 8 per cent
                        Customs duty has been reduced to 4 per cent. on coal, timber, live stock,
                        petroleum, and on some other articles. I wish, more over, to observe that
                        whether the Customs duty in Egypt is levied at 8 or 4 per cent., or at any
                        otber figure, it does not in any way offend against free trade principles It
                        is im. posed for strictly revenue purpnses; and I am not aware that any
                        free-trader objects to the imposition of Customs duties for such purposee,
                        although he may regret the necessity for doing 80. What free traders object
                        toistheimposition of Customs duties for protective purposes. (Hear, hear.)
                        Now, the only important case which bas occurred in Egypt where this special
                        issue was raised was in connexion with the duty on cotton goods. Until a few
                        years ago, there were no cotton factories in Egypt. When they were
                        established, an excise daty, equivalent to the Customs duty, was put on the
                        indigenous manufactures Otherwise, local industry wonld have been protected.
                        This Excise daty, which is similar to that which used to be levied on
                        certain articles in the United Kingdom but a faw years ago, and which is now
                        levied in India, was not imposed in order to please Manchester, as is
                        sometimes alleged, but in order to prevent an artificial industry from
                        springing up, and in order to safeguard the Customs revenue of Egypt.</p>

                    <p>We cannot belp regretting that Lord Cromer in his speech delivered to the
                        Glasgow and West Scotland Unionist Free Trade Club yesterday showed no more
                        disposition to promote conciliation between the two wings of the Unionist
                        party than he showed in his address to those present at the Unionist Free
                        Trade dinner on November 21. Generally, his speech last night was erambe
                        repetita, as regards the fiscal reform controversy, and we do not think it
                        needful to repeat what we said on the occasion of his last exposition of his
                        faith. We prefer to dwell more on the subjects as to which agreement with
                        Lord Cromer is easy than on those as to which it is difficult or even
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>"STANDARD." </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer admits that the national revenue is inadequate for the national
                        purposes, that direct taxation has reached its limit, and that Free Traders
                        do not object to the imposition of Castoms doties for revente por poses. He
                        thinks that by the exercise of strict economy something may be saved on the
                        present expenditure, but he does not pretend that economy alone will be
                        sufficient to enable up to pay our way, and be offers no other suggestion as
                        to how we shall raise the money for reforms which he does not deny are
                        urgent.</p>
                    <p>"TRIBUNE." </p>
                    <p>His whole speech was that of a complete Free Trader He repeated the weighty
                        warning given at the Unionist Free Trade Club dinner in November, thșt Free
                        Trade is the only sound basis of onr peaceful Imperial policy. He showed
                        that his policy in Egypt was always striotly loyal to Free Trade, so that,
                        when cotton faotories were established in that country, an Excise duty was
                        pat on in order that they might not be artificially fostered by the Customs
                        duty on foreign cotton. He took all the main 1 points of Free Trade doctrine
                        as accepted without question by himself and his audience; he riddled, with
                        all the certainty of an expert financier, Mr. Balfour's unsound doctrine of
                        the merits of taxing "'s large variety of articles" : and he declared that
                        Free Trade bad partionlarly benefited tbe poorest classes-from which it
                        follows that they would suffer, most from Tariff Reform</p>

                    <head>WEDDING IN CAIRO. MOSSERI SUARES.</head>
                    <p>One of the biggest weddings of the last few seasons took place yesterday
                        afternoon at the Jewish Synagogue when the marriage of Mr. Elie Mosseri, son
                        of the late Nessim Mosseri Bey, to Mlle Laure Susres daughter of Mme and the
                        late Felix Soares, was witnessed by an enormous crowd of their friends and
                        rela tions. To synagogue had been magnificently decorated for the occasion,
                        the crimson and gold chairs facing the congregation where sat the
                        bridegroom, being surmonted by a bigh canopy of crimson and gold. The
                        wedding was fixed for balf past three ; but long before that hour the guests
                        began to arrive, the crowd being so great that the police bad to suspend all
                        ordinary traffic in the adjoining streets. Rarely have we seen even in Cairo
                        such a collection of magnificent toilettes and wealth of jewels as were
                        noticed on this occasion or more bandsome women to do them justice. It was
                        8.45, when the chuch was foll to overflowing. that the bride arrived and was
                        led through the crowd to her chair where sbe was met by the bridegroom.
                        Variour of the near relatives were gathered round them, Mme Felix Suares,
                        Mme Mosseri, and the three beautiful sisters of the bride Baronness Menasce,
                        Mme Rollo, and Mme Suares. The bride indeed looked lovely in &amp; satin
                        gown of empire cut, draped tightly across the front of the waist and hanging
                        from the back in broad wattean pleat. There was lovely lace draped across
                        the shoulders of the soft corsage which was cut en caur at the base of the
                        neck. She wore a wreath of orange blossems on her hair over which was the
                        regulation tulle veil, and she also carried &amp; small bouquet of bridal
                        flowers. Her three sisters all wore bats of black velvet surmounted with
                        handsome white plnmes Baropne Menasce and Mme Rollo had on lovely white
                        dresses mossed with lace, that of Mme Suares was in grey heavily embroidered
                        with a long peplum tunic of grey chiffon. The service was quite short and
                        fully choral, the choir being accompanied by the organ and harp. The
                        ceremonies over, the wine being drunk from the same cup while the veil was
                        held over the heads of both bride and bridegroom and the ring placed in
                        position, the organ thundered forth the wedding March, and after receiving
                        the salutations from their near relatives, the happy paie made their way
                        through the crowd and back to the palatial residence of Mme Felix Suares in
                        Kash Doubara. Practioally everyone wbo attended the service was present at
                        the subsequent reception, the rooms being so crowded that it was difficult
                        at times to obtain ingress or egress The drive from gate to doorway was
                        covered with rngs, baskets of gorgeous flowers flanking it on either side.
                        Flowers decked the interior, an enormous corbeille from H H. the Khediva
                        gracing the entrance hall and many others lining the rooms and passages
                        upstairs where the presents were exhibited. In one salon Mr. and Mme Elie
                        Mosseri stood to receive the congratalations of their friends : in another
                        the most substantial buffet attracted a deal of attention while waiters were
                        doing their best to cope with the situation and Mlle Alice so Icng connected
                        with the family, was busy dispensing sweetmeats and bonbons to the assembled
                        company. A continual stream of people were passing up and down the staircase
                        to and from the rooms where the beautiful presents were on view. It is
                        impossible here to give any complete list of the beautiful things that were
                        laid out with great taste on the tables. There were some lovely things in
                        chins, and bronze, electric lamps and objets d'art of all sorts and
                        descriptions : big bowle of lovely design containing gold fisb-gilt coffee
                        sets and all manner of beautiful things in silver - two complete sets of
                        toilette necessaries at least, and some very fine pieces of furniture. Three
                        beautiful fans adorned one table ; in a glass fronted armoire there was
                        jewellery enongh to satisfy the heart of the most exigeante ; bracelets,
                        necklaces and rings of all descriptions and values, ineluding one enormous
                        emerald mounted as a brooch, a superb string of pearls, and a long chain
                        stud ded at close intervals with fine diamonds.</p>
                    <p>As it is impossible to enumerate the presents, so also it is impossible to
                        mention a tithe of the people who responded to the invitations with their
                        presence. Amongst them we rotice Leds Valda Machell and Mr. Machell, Dr.
                        Martino Pasha and Mme de Martino, Count Zogheb, Mme. Balai in a beautiful

                        pale blue about the corsage. Mre. Rachael Cattani, one of the handsomest
                        women present, was wearing a beautiful princesse frock of white cloth,
                        heavily soutached, the wide revers across the shoulders meet ing at the
                        waist over the collarless vèst of fine lace. She also wore a black bat with
                        white plumes, and beautiful pearls about her neck. Her sister Mlle Frances
                        was in white. Mrs. Schuyler Ross was very handsomely gowned in a transparent

                        skirt heavily soutaob. ed; her most becoming bat was of pale pink satin, the
                        wido brim lined with beliotrope, and the crown almost hidden by a mass of
                        pink feathers. Mme Osorio who was present with her husband, the Spanish
                        Minister, was in white with a pretty bat bear. ing shaded brown roses. Mme

                        straps of oriental einbroidery. We noticed Mr. and Mrs. Svott Dalgliesh, Mme
                        Heller, Mme Aghion, Maitre and Mrs. Carton de Wiart with their son and
                        nephew, Senateur and Mme Adamoli <cb n="6"/> and their daagters both in

                        other of the notabilities of Cairo and Alexandria. In her capacity as
                        hostess Mme Felix Suares was very ably supported by her daughters and her
                        song, Messieurs Leon and André Suares, who were indefatigable in the
                        performance of their daties. The reception was in every way a most
                        successful one and the bride and bridet groom carried away with them the
                        hearties congratulations of every guest who was present.</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir-I note "a Sufferer's" complaint of yesterday and may say I went
                        repeatedly to the P.O. to get letters, and often found thirty or more people
                        at my section, D-L, and the froway mob of all sorts and conditions fairly
                        frightened me away. Of course it must be a difficult problem with the mixed
                        Cairo population, but it is rather a sad sight to see hundreds of people,
                        many utterly poverty stricken and wretched, waiting their turn for letters,
                        many containing remittances probably. I think since I was here first in 1909
                        the Cairo PO. has to cope with vastly increased business and has outgrown
                        its capacity. The P.O. building is utterly unworthy of such a city as Cairo.
                        The letters might be divided into a few more sections or each section could
                        have an extra clerk and pigeon hole. I must, however, pay a tribute to the
                        courtesy shown me by Mr. Williams, the Directer at Cairo, and his chief,
                        Borton Bey in Cairo over some letters that were missing through no fault of
                        the P.O. I regard the administration of the Egyptian Post Office as
                        marvellously well run, considering the exceptional difficulties of the
                        diverse languages and the continual arrival of mails by every steamer and
                        the impossibility of obtaining the national staff that France, England, and
                        Italy can obtain.</p>

                        accompaniment of artificially terrified morning and wailing. Most of the
                        guests stayed until 3 o'clock but it was an hour later when the National
                        Anthem brought to selone &amp; most entertaining and successful evening
                        which must surely go down to posterity in the annals of the Battalion. It
                        would be impossible to bestow too much praise to Sergeant and Mrs James for
                        the excellence of their ontering and also to Sergeant James and Armonier

                    <p>The case of Mrs Lily Middows, of Thornton Staret, Bedford, is one which shows
                        how seriously Intense enfeebles the system. Severe depression accompanied
                        her physical weakness, and when melancholy settled upon her its influence
                        upon mind and body was most distressing and life became almost unbearable.
                        Mrs Midtows trankly describes her sufferings and gladly goes on to tell how
                        she was cured by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, the Temerly the

                    <p>"My illness began with influenta," she told the reporter, and at one time,
                        Iosed to sit in a melancholy mood all day, brooding over my health. The
                        thought of the many remedies 1 had vainly tried filled me with an
                        indescribable dread of the future became titless, and offered from severe
                        headaches. At night I was very restless From nervous slumber I would be
                        awakened by startling dreams. My body wwwffused in perspiration. Every
                        morning I felt so depressed that I could scarcely face the trouble of rising
                        and dressing. Food produced nause, gnawing pains across my chest and
                        shoulders and violent sickness My body felt billed. From s backing cough I
                        sometimes thought my chest would burst. I suffered from an unnatural thirst,

                        up distressing palpitation." </p>
                    <p>THE THRILL OP HEALTH RENEWED.</p>
                    <p>"I took all kinds of medicines in vain," Mrs. Middoww added, but I had never
                        an hour's freedom from pain until I took Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale

                        through my Derves and rich, warm blood in my veins. My strength grew, my

                    <head>MRS. EDDY AND CHARITY. </head>
                    <p>- The announcement made in last week's issue of the Sentinel" that Mr. Eddy
                        purposes founding " Christian Science institution for the special benefit of
                        the poor and the general gnod of all mankind," has heen widely copied by the
                        daily press, and as been the subject of favor able editorial comment. Much
                        of this comment is along the line of that which appeared in The Boston
                        Herald of Dec. 24, which was as follows: </p>
                    <p>The intimation from Mrs. Eddy that she intends to set apart one million
                        dollars for a permanent fund with which to relieve poverty and extend aid to
                        the nerdy, is a departure significant as a precedent, as well as commendable
                        in itself. The Christian Science Reet has been severely received for its
                        omission to carry on the life and charitable work under institutional aus I
                        pices, Mrs Eddy, with her unchallenged power, can alter this, and by
                        implication would seem to be willing to do so. </p>
                    <p>Alluding to this article in the Herald, Mrs Eddy says that about 1878 she
                        opened a </p>
                    <p>Christian Science "Home" in Lynn, Mass, in which l'indigent students were
                        given their board and instruction in Christian Science gratuitously, but the
                        misconduct of some of these students caused her to close this "Home" </p>
                    <p>Mrs Eddy has consented that the institution which she proposes to found shall
                        bear her name, therefore it will be known as "Mary Baker G. Eddy'sCharitable
                        Fund." Its Board of Directors will be located in Boston, the recognised
                        headquarters of her church. The shurobot Christ, Scientist, and in plan and
                        scope this Pond will be an educational opportunity by by which indigent
                        persons will be taught gratuitously the Science of the Christ healing as
                        practised by Jesus and as made known to this age through "Science and Health
                        with Key to the Scriptures, and the other writings of Mrs Eddy. </p>
                    <p>The sum of one million dollars will be devoted to this sole purpose. Mrs
                        Eddy's benevolence will be open to all those indivi. duals who are genuinely
                        interested in Chris tian Science for its truth's sake, and who shall present
                        to the Board of Directors of the Fand satisfactory certification as to their
                        indigence, their religious views, and their moral character. These
                        certificates must bear the signature of some well-known Christian Scientist
                        who can vouch for the facts stated therein. The students of Christian
                        Science will be maintained by this Fund until such time as the Board of
                        Directors shall have pronounced them good healers of the sick, and delivered
                        to them certificates to this oleo The beneficiaries of this Fund, and the
                        families of those who have families, are to be supported from the income of
                        the Pond, and the number of students and their families to be supported will
                        depend upon the Ancont of this income Among those to be taught and supported
                        thus will be some petons who are trained and qualified nurses and genuinely
                        interested in Christian Science </p>
                    <p>Mrs Eddy has turned this matter over to prospective Board of Directors, for
                        them to work out the details of the charity, and necessarily it will be
                        someonbilerabe time before the work of this Board can be completed. In the
                        meantime no further information upon this subject can be given out, and no
                        letters of inquiry should be addressed to Mrs. Eddy. </p>

                    <p>Lundi 80 Janvier Après un début tree animé, notre marobe s'est almé en cours
                        de séance pour finir cependant i on niveau plus élevé que ven dredi dernier
                        Nombre de valeurs, qui étaient depuis longtemps négligées, reviennent en
                        faveur grâce à la reprise générale. En un mot, bien qu'un certain nombre
                        conserve des doutes sur la continuation du mouvement et persiste ne croire à
                        sucun relèvement appréciable tant que la situation n'est pas changée, la
                        plupart abondent dans le sens d'une reprise durable de non plus seulement à
                        la pure speculation mais basée sur des principes solides, tels que la baisse
                        du taux d'escompte et l'amélioration géadrale qui en est la conséquence.
                        Quoi qu'il en soit, pour le moment la tendance wat baussière et si les
                        transactions demeurent en somme restreintes, on peut dire que c'est la seule
                        raison pour laquelle on ait lieu de se montrer réservé. </p>
                    <p>A remarquer, faisant contraste avec l'activité de ce jours derniers, on
                        délaissement de l'A gricole et de la National Bank, qui cloturent
                        sensiblement au même prix. Toutefois l'Agricole perd 1/89 à 7 23/32 </p>
                    <p>Les Jouissanoes Eaux du Caire perdent aussi 4 frocs i 174 et les Nongovich
                        Hotels 1/2 livre à 13. </p>
                    <p>En revanche, l'Obligation Crédit Foncier avaboe rapidement de 280 à 987
                        l'ancienne et de 253 256 la nouvelle, ainsi que les Lots Turcs de 166 a 170.
                        LA Deferred Delta pro gresse également de 5 à 51/8, la Land Bank de 7 3/8 à
                        7 1/2, et la Banque d'Orient de 114 1/2 à 118. </p>
                    <p>Le Crédit Franco Bgyptien, plus ou moins délaissé depuis des mois, a passé
                        pour ainsi dire au premier rang des titres favoris. Ce sont, parait-il, les
                        arbitragistes avec Paris qui achè tent ici pour revendre sur cette place ou
                        le prix est sensiblement supérieur, 107 francs, contro 104 ici. On a cloturé
                        ce matin à 4 3/16 ache teurs contre 4 1/82 Vendredi passé. </p>

                    <p>La légère reprise constatée ces jours derniers en United provenait de

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel bomewards Great osre has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrivo in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in whi you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Rivers and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rote, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will wait to take into
                        consideration the number of days to be spent at ses, and we therefore
                        subjoin a list shewing the time oo-cupied on each of the various routes
                        between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. </p>

                    <p>The long sea routes -- from Port Said or AlexAndria to Plymouth, Southampton,
                        London or Liverpool-occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows:
                        Port Said or Alexandris to Brindisi 3 days </p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Messina .. .. ... 3</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P. &amp; O., North German Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, Bibby and Henderson
                        Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                        travellers to Egypt. As regards the train journeys from Cairo the shortest
                        is that to Alexandria without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be
                        made without change in 4 ½ hours. The least expensive way to England is by
                        the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of stormers from Alexandria
                        to Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria
                        to Hamburg, </p>

                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P. &amp; 0. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express frem
                        Alexandria As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very
                        little luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are
                        several good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a
                        fixed charge to deliver packAges to any address in Europe. The quickest
                        manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast Mail
                        Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port Said

                    <p>The ITALIAN LAKES. VENICE is a 5 hours journey by mail from Milan, and one of
                        the most delightful places imaginable to PAN &amp; quiet stay. The total
                        abornice of vehicular traffic strikes one m very strango; no horse, cart,
                        carriage or bietole is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at
                        every turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                        other port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the ses.
                        No bills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the top of Campaniles
                        appears above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like
                        a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon. Going northwards from Milan you make
                        the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes COMO, the birthplace of the younger
                        Pliny, is reached in one and a quarter hours by train by way of Monts: Bonta
                        leaves Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremesso along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlessa on Lake Lagano in three quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lagano in two and three quarter hours. </p>
