                            <p>The prolonged stay of the Baltic Fleet in Kamaranh Bay is causing

                                Japanese comment upon the stay of Baltic Fleet at Kamaranh in the
                                most severe manner. The "Asahi" charges France with deliberately
                                concealing the presence of the Baltic Fleet. The "Ji Ji" declares
                                that the russians are simply using Kamaranh as a naval base and that
                                Japan must ask Great Britains co-operation under her alliances. (R)

                        DISCOVERY.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Covington, who iS at present at work on tho Great Pyramid, has relocated
                        the exterior end of the King'SChamber south air channel discovered by Col.
                        Howard-Vyse in 1837. The original discoverer made no arrangements for
                        keeping the aperture permanently open, and it has in consequence, become
                        choked by débris and sand falling from above Were tills air channel, with
                        those of the well shafts, kept clear, the oppressive beat of the interior
                        passages of the Great Pyramid would be much abated, and a temperature of
                        under 70% degrees secured. To keep the passage clear Mr. Covington proposes
                        to place a sheet-iron funnel 30 inches-long and nine inches square at the
                        exterior aperture of the air channel. This will keep débris stones, etc,
                        from finding their way into the passage, which is only 9 inches square and'
                        therefore blocks easily. Mr. Covington is also at work in the hope of coming
                        across the external outlet of the' Queen's Chamber, south air channel. The
                        interior end of the passage was only discovered by Weyman-Dickson in 1872,
                        after he had chiseled through 5 inches of stone. Manifestly this end of the
                        passage had not been carried through and the pass channel may have no outlet
                        on the exterior of the Pyramid. It was, of course, not boxed, but allowed
                        for in the building of the successive courses. Professor Flinders Petrie
                        suggested that its issue is to be looked fur at the 85th course, but Mr.
                        Covington has had to give up the search, alter fruitlessly exploring a
                        radius of 35 feet round the spot suggested. During his search be made -a
                        discovery of some interest, and we give an extract Dorn the finder's report
                        addressed to Professor Maspero :— "Ou Friday last, while searching for the
                        undiscovered exterior end of the Queen's Chamber south air channel, I found
                        embedded in the hardened débris on the 84th course of the Great Pyramid,
                        directly below the outer end of the King's Chamber south air channel, two
                        fragments (counterparts) of a triangular-shaped high-grade limestone, which
                        originally measured some 17 + 16 +10} inches, two edges being bevelled at an
                        angle of 71 degrees and the other at about 50 to 75 degrees. Deeply incised
                        in thé dressed surface was the full tenth part of an 18-inch diameter
                        circle. The stones, from,' 2 to 2 inches thick, had been let into the
                        pryamid casing atoue probably for astronomical purposes. The reverse side
                        and the bevelled edges retained small patches of bufi-culourod cement." The
                        finder adds that in two respects the find may be considered important : with
                        the exception of the inscription mentioned by Herodotus, this is the only
                        record of any stone-bearing characters of any kind being found on the face
                        of tho Pyramid. This is the only known stone that has been let in to the
                        Pyramid casing. Mr. Covington hopes that the undiscovered air passage exit
                        may turn up on the 76th coursé It runs up from tho Queens Chamber at its
                        start at an angle of 37 degrees, which should bring it out at this
                        point—always supposing that the angle does not alter. Considerable interest
                        is being taken in the clearing of the Sphinx, and a meeting of the committee
                        formed for this purpose will probably be called about the end of the month
                        to go into, some questions of detail and to appoint executive and finance
                        committees. We learn that, if approached on this subject by the responsible
                        authorities, the Prisons Department will agree to supply the services of one
                        or two hundred able-bodied tenants of theirs who would, of course, receive a
                        small wage from the Excavation Committee. Instoad of carrying the trench
                        loading from the paws of the Sphinx to the cultivation due East, it is to be
                        taken S.E to avoid the destruction of personal property, and to avoid a
                        large sand hummock which promised groat difficulties. This course will
                        enable the excavators to complete the work at a cost below the original
                        estimate of LE 4,000. </p>

                        Government, arrived at Sues from Shanghai with 800 Russian refugees from
                        Port Arthur and other Far Eastern towns. The "Andalusia" entered the Canal
                        in tin evening bound to Odessa, and her decks were so crowded with men,
                        women, and children, that the majority of the deck passengers wore sleeping
                        on long cone chairs, while the first and second-class was quite full. </p>

                    <p>The bridges on the Egyptian Railway Administration's system have always been
                        a great source of trouble and expense, and the difficulties which the
                        Administration has had to face from this cause have been enormous. The Nile
                        bridges at Embabeh, Benha, and Kafr Zayat have now been placed in a fairly
                        good condition, but the bridge over tho Mah-moudieh Canal at Hagar-Nawatieh
                        has recently given rise to considerable apprehension and anxiety. The fault
                        appears to be due to the fact that the steel was not properly tested at
                        first. The bridge was entirely reconstructed a year ago, and totally new one
                        being put up. Lately some of the longitudinals connecting the girders showed
                        signs of cracking, and the Administration has had to replace them by new
                        ones. It is believed that the bridge will now be able to stand the strain of
                        the traffic with safety. The Administration has in the person of M. Husson a
                        very capable bridge engineer, and he ought to be given a free hand to
                        undertake everything necessary for the safety of the bridges throughout the
                        Administrations system. </p>

                        carefully looked after. This has caused a very good impression for, As a
                        rule, this class of person receives very little consideration in allotments.

                        <dateline>Assiout, April 12</dateline>
                        <p>A few days ago a very interesting musical and literary entertainment took
                            place at the American College. About three hundred people attended, and
                            it proved a great success. It may be here remarked that the
                            entertainment was carried through wholly by the students themselves. It
                            contained songs by some ladies invited for this purpose, pianoforte
                            solos and duets, quartettes and declamations given by Students. One or
                            two minor details might be brought to the notice of the president of the
                            school. Some of the boys appear before the public 'in galabiehs and
                            somewhat unclean. True it is, some of them are poor, but it does not
                            cost much, to have them dressed in uniforms, even at the expense of the
                            school itself. Again, some of the declamations given were of a kind
                            completely useless for the student; he loses a lot of time in learning a
                            long story by heart, to recite it before a number of people, without
                            adding to his store of information or bettering his school life. The
                            time spent in such things might be usefully employed in studying lessons
                            or learning something practical. But on the whole, thanks are due to the
                            managers of this school perhaps things will go better in the future.

                    <head>SOMETHING MORE ABOUT CRIME </head>
                    <p>The Court of Assiout delivered one more death sentence on Monday. A certain
                        Bekhit Has-saiieio, from Aghanna (Tabta), murdered, a few months ago, the
                        omdeh of his village, in the hope of his (the murderer's) nephew taking his
                        place. He was arrested and was condemned yesterday. The way in which the
                        criminal carried out his intention Was horrible. He slew the victim with a
                        knife before sunset, in a place about 100 metres from the village, and after
                        killing him, cut his fingers and stabbed his dead body in nine different
                        place. This death sentence is the fourth of its kind passed by tho Assiout
                        Court since 1st March. </p>

                    <p>The death penalty is carried out now, according to the new regulations, in
                        the precincts of the prison. People merely hear of them, and I really think
                        that the old system of public executions is more effective. The fellah has
                        not yet arrived at that stage of civilization where he suffered much moral
                        pain. He needs something to strike his sensesin order that they may be
                        affected, and I feel certain that if these four sentences were carried but
                        publicly in Assiout, a very long time would pass without one hearing of such
                        crimes being committed. </p>

                    <head>AN INSTITUTION FOR CAIRO</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of The Egyptian Gazette Sir.—I am pleased to see from the
                        letters of "No Surrender" and "Anti-Bigot" that there are some people whose'
                        minds are able to grasp the fact that narrow minded fanaticism is not
                        Christianity nor the spirit of bigotry the "same mind that was in Christ
                        Jesus." I was tempted to exclaim "It is enough. I even I only am left..and
                        they seek my lyfe to take it away." Alter long residence to Cairo I confirm
                        all that was said in the 'Mosquito Net"' of Saturday last, and could add
                        a.lot more that was not said. If any man think there was an exaggeration let
                        him put himself under my guidance, and without police escort, I will show
                        him things which will make him a sadder and a wiser man. I will let Him see
                        sights which will freeze the very marrow of his bones, and yet I will show
                        him nothing which is not sought after earnestly by thousuds of young men in
                        this city, no number of Englishment being on the list There is a Trinity of
                        Evil at work, Drink, Gambling ud Impurity, and of these three, the last is
                        the worst Unless the Social Evil in Cairo is changed, it will continue to
                        grow until the city be ravaged by an epidemic to which the Plague at London
                        will be nothing What then are we going to do? Are we going to sit down
                        quitely and watch the triumph of the evil ine? I beg pardon, I mean) I for
                        one am not. As long as I have a voice to raise, and an oppurtinty to raise
                        it, people shall hear, whether they will hear, or whether they will
                        forbear,their duty to the thousands of young men, yes and the thousands of
                        unfortunate women, who are to be found on the sstreets of cairo at any time
                        after dark. I speak to you, my brothers, For a silent voiceless cry From the
                        streets of of Egypt's cities Goes up to god on high. By the love ye bear
                        your mothers. Your sisters of your wives, I bid you sheild the honor Of
                        other women's lives If all who are ready to help on the work of forming an
                        institute for young men at Cairo will send me a card at my residence, No.9,
                        Sharia Soliman Pasha, we may be able to unite and do something more useful
                        than carry on a wordy war with our friends-I am,etc.</p>
