                        one Progressive candidate was returned, compared with 17 in 1903. Up to the
                        present the Moderate party has gained 283 seats here. In the provinces they
                        have also scored big (Feuter)</p>

                    <p>The great triennial fight for Municipal ascendency in England has resulted,
                        as will be seen by the above telegrams, in the defeat of the Progressive and
                        Labour candidates.</p>
                    <p>This victory of the Municipal Reformers, as the Moderates have re-christened
                        themselves, is evidently due to the alarm aroused by the very collectivist
                        tendencies manifested by the Progressive majority on the Borough Councils
                        and by the disgust at the recent disclosures on local Government morality in
                        London. The air has been heavy with scandals for some time past, and the
                        gederal tone of the conduct of Municipal affairs has shown little signs of
                        improvement, especially since the recent revelations as to the lines on
                        which the Eastend Municipalities have been ran.</p>
                    <p>The Progressives have not been very confident, as they were fearful lest by
                        their policy of extravagance they might have courted the displeasure of
                        certain of the working-class districts upon which the Labour party had set
                        its eye. Of the 1,362 members of the new City Borough Councils only a small
                        minority were avowed champions of advanced Labourism. In the main the
                        struggle was between the Muni cipal Reformers and the Progressives. These
                        two parties had prior to the election on Thursday practically equal
                        representation in London. Out of twenty eight Borough Counoils, thirteen
                        were Moderate, and a like number Progressive, with two "doubtfals."</p>
                    <p>The members of the Borough Councils elected on the Ist inst. will remain in
                        office for a period of three years.</p>
                    <p>Possibly the real significance of the election results is mainly to be looked
                        for in the dislike of the average voter to the extraordinary wastefulness in
                        the various municipal industrial experiments. These experiments are part of
                        a great collectivist programme involving a com plete industrial revolution.
                        Municipal trading may become a recognised social fact in the fature, but on
                        this subject most people at home should say, in the words of Henry Sidgwick,
                        that they are patriotic enough to wish some other nation would try it
                        first.</p>

                    <p>THE NEWFOUNDLAND AFFAIR.</p>
                    <p>A SERIOUS SITUATION.</p>
                    <p>LONDON, November 2.</p>
                    <p>Telegrams are being constantly exchanged between the Imperial Government and
                        the Governor of Newfoundland in connection with the modus vivendi. The
                        situation is serious. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>The troubles of the present Government in its relations with various parts of
                        the Empire appear to be endless.</p>
                    <p>The present difficulty with Newfoundland does not, however, arise from any
                        fault of the Government, but is due to the inherently anworkable system of
                        our Empire, which has become quite as anachronistio as the political
                        machinery on which the United States is run. The crux of the difficulty is
                        seen in the reply s few days ago of the Under-Secretary for the Colonies to
                        a question as to the attitude of Newfoundland towards an agreement made with
                        a foreign Power on a matter profoundly affecting the interests of the
                        Colony, in which be made a statement which should force us to understand the
                        hopelessly anomalous position we now occupy. The Government has not been, he
                        said, so fortunate as to obtain the consent of the Newfoundland Government
                        to the arrangement, but as it is a question of a treaty with a foreign
                        Power, the Foreign Secretary is alone concerned, and neither the Colonial
                        Office, nor the Colony which is so vitally interested in the matter, has any
                        voice in it at all.</p>
                    <p>Is it possible to imagine anything more absurd The Colony has not even the
                        right to approach the Foreign Secretary on the subject, except indirectly,
                        and the statesman who has to decide it is in no way responsible to those
                        whose interests are principally involved. He is responsible to the
                        Parliament at Westminster alone, and so long as he pleases that assembly, he
                        is free to saorifice colonial interests to any extent he may think
                        convenient. It is quite possible that we may some day have a Foreign
                        Minister who would take a positive pleasure in doing so, and a House of
                        Commons which would heartily endorse his action.</p>
                    <p>No Empire could hold together permanently under such conditions, and they
                        must undergo a radical change if the great fabric is not to go to pieces
                        before our eyes. The only possible remedy is the establishment in some form
                        or other of an Imperial Council, chosen by and out of the whole Empire, to
                        which those Ministers who have charge of Imperial interests shall be
                        responsible. The House of Commons, would then be left free to deal with
                        local affairs in the same way as are the other Parliaments of the Empire,
                        and would cease to interfere in those foreign and colonial affairs which it
                        so deplorably misunderstands and mismanages now.</p>

                    <p>ITS TARDY APPEARANCE.</p>
                    <p>The Report of the Ministry of Public Works on the progress of its various
                        departments daring 1905 has not yet made its appearance, and yet we are less
                        than two months from 1907. The report is the most important departmental
                        publication issued annually by the Egyptian Government, and should contain a
                        vast amount of invaluable local information. Year after year the report is
                        most tardy in making its appearance, and officials in the Public Works
                        Department confess that the question of the permanent postponement of its
                        publication absolutely depends on the good pleasure of the Adviser to that
                        Ministry.</p>
                    <p>As public opinion is as yet a very feeble institution in this country, and
                        Lord Cromer has many other matters of greater and equal importance to
                        supervise, it is very probable that these complaints will continue to be
                        reiterated year after year. In fact, for years past correspondents have
                        asked in our columns why this report should be published after such a lapse
                        of time as to render much of its contents practically valueless. No answer
                        has ever been vouchsafed to their just complaints, and the report this year
                        is as late, if not later than ever. There is no remedy for such a state of
                        things. Public opinion in Egypt 18 80 incoherent and timorons that it is a
                        simple thing to float it, and there the matter rests, until the same
                        complaints and protests come up next year to be treated with the same
                        indifference.</p>

                    <p>EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE.</p>
                    <p>An interesting case came before the British Consular Court at Cairo this
                        morning. The plaintiff is Captain Jorge Neilken y Waldberg, editor and
                        proprietor at "The Oriental Truth" a bilingual Cairo daily newspaper
                        published in French and Arabio.</p>
                    <p>The defendant is Mr. Bennett, an Englishman, private secretary to the
                        well-known Anglo- Belgian leader of the Cairo Bar, Maïtre Carton de
                        Wiart.</p>
                    <p>Captain Waldberg, in an article in his paper giving his version of the
                        affair, states that he was summoned to the offices of Maitre Carton de Wiart
                        by telephone and that when he arrived there the defendant and two other
                        individuals threw themselves on him, and maltreated him. In the scuffle the
                        Captain lost his gold-rimmed eye-glasses and £20 and none of these
                        belongings of his have been returned to him.</p>
                    <p>At the hearing of the case to-day Captain Waldberg, after having been sworn,
                        stated that he was the editor of "The Oriental Truth," a Latin-American by
                        birth, and a citizen of the United States. He said that on the 29th ulto.,
                        about noon, he received a communication at his office from one of the
                        members of his staff. In consequence of this he called at about 3.15 p.m. at
                        the offices of Maitre Carton de Wiart. After a time Mr. Bennett appeared and
                        told him to come into the office. Upon witness entering the office Mr.
                        Bennett made certain statements and afterwards made a felonious assault on
                        him. (By the Court: The assault was not felonious.) The defendant hit him in
                        the face and his eye-glasses fell down and were broken to pieces. There were
                        other persons in the room at the thime and, far as he could remember, Mr.
                        Bennett said nothing previous to the assault. Besides the eye glasses he
                        lost four five pound bank notes. Mr. Bennett "chucked" him out of the
                        office, saying, besides other things, that every English soldier would break
                        plaintiff's bones. The situation not being very pleasant he thought he had
                        better go away and left the building. He afterwards called on Maitre Carton
                        de Wiart.</p>
                    <p>CROSS EXAMINATION.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Le Breton, on behalf of defendant, afterwards cross examined plaintiff.
                        Witness stated that he did not try to stay in the office but went out as
                        soon as possible. He then proceeded to Maitre Carton de Wiart's house in a
                        carriage. He admitted asking the Maitre if he was cognisant of the assault.
                        The Maitre made a communication to him and the interview closed.</p>
                    <p>In answer to a question defendant admitted his responsibility for "Le Coucou
                        Egyptien" and also for certain articles, which were produced in Court.</p>
                    <p>Counsel for the defence: "Do you know that the Maitre is M. Empain's
                        advocate? Plaintiff objected to the question.</p>
                    <p>Do you generally extort money by blackmailing efforts ?</p>
                    <p>(Here there were voluble protests on the part of plaintiff, he declaring that
                        he would hold Mr. Le Breton answerable for it)..</p>
                    <p>The Court: Counsel is privileged.</p>

                        ejaculations with compliments to British justice).</p>

                    <p>Did you ever tell Father Belays that it would do much harm to publish certain

                        of whom were obtained by force?-This is untrue.</p>
                    <p>Is it also untrue that you told him you held some very compromising letters,

                    <p>In answer to a protest by plaintiff counsel for defence said he had liberty
                        to ask certain questions to prove his case, namely, that defendant was
                        simply a common blackmailer. </p>

                        Kramer requiring investigation, and did you publish this article?-Yes; I
                        published an article about Mr. Kramer but do not remember its exact
                        contents.</p>
                    <p>Do you know Mr. Empain, and did you.not till him that you had received many

                        article was produced).</p>
                    <p>When you went to the office did Mr. Bennett show you two papers with two
                        envelopes pinned to them ?-No.</p>
                    <p>Did you not deny that it was your handwriting, and was it not then that Mr.
                        Bennett pushed you out of the room ?- No, Sir. </p>
                    <p>Witness said he retired slowly backwards. He held a heavy stick but did not
                        use it. Mr. Bennett tried to take the stick away.</p>
                    <p>BITING ADMITTED.</p>
                    <p>Did you bite Mr. Bennett on the left arm ?-Yes; I had no other defence.</p>
                    <p>You never applied at the office for the £20 you say you lost?-No, I thought I
                        had better not. I thought the servant had picked them up.</p>

                    <p>Further cross-examination followed.</p>
                    <p>There were other people in the room. He did not call them as witnesses as it
                        would be ridiculous, as one member of the office would not bear witness

                    <p>By plaintiff :</p>
                    <p>Did you call me by telephone to your office at 3.15?-"No, and I may add that
                        plaintiff must have known I was not at the office as he came to my house
                        directly after the alleged assault. He had no knowledge of plaintiff being
                        called to the office. On the morning of the 29th or the day before the
                        alleged assault be received envelopes containing marked passages from papers
                        which seemed to refer to himself. The envelopes were addressed to him in the
                        plaintiff's handwriting. He told Mr. Bennett he had better interview
                        plaintiff. It this sort of thing continued he would have to take strong
                        measures against the plaintiff, who was obviously trying to blackmail him.
                        Plaintiff was not to set foot in the office.</p>
                    <p>By plaintiff. Did you say you'd been blackmailed before ?-No, what I said was
                        that attempts had been made to blackmail me ; firstly, in the case of M.
                        Empain, whose advocate I am known to be, and secondly, in an article very
                        properly headed "Chantage." In this article it was stated we shall very
                        shortly publish a book giving a variety of details concerning persons whom I
                        gather were habitual companions of its author such as diplomatists,
                        financiers, and other notables.- Publication admitted by plaintiff.</p>
                    <p>By Plaintiff: Do you subscribe to "Oriental Truth" ? -Yes, I subscribe to
                        every paper in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Where is the letter in my handwriting ?-Enclosed in the envelope I
                        received.</p>
                    <p>There was no such letter.-The envelopes of which you confessed yourself
                        ignorant just now bore your handwriting. (Plaintiff tried to explain himself
                        and became very involved.) </p>
                    <p>Did you try to get me, an American citizen, expelled from Egypt ? - I said I
                        would do my best to make you suffer and would ask Lord Cromer to help
                        me.</p>
                    <p>Did you ever give me any inside information ? -No, I never gave you an atom
                        of information, though you often came to my office.</p>
                    <p>CASE DISMISSED.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Alban, summing up, stated that, while the defendant admitted an assault
                        having been committed, the evidence produced by the defence made it very
                        probable that an attempt at blackmail had been committed and he would
                        therefore dismiss the charge.</p>
                    <p>No costs were allowed.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the case there were marked signs of approval at the decision
                        of Mr. Alban and Captain Waldberg disappeared with great velocity.</p>
