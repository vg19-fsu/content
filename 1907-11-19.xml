                    <p>proud, the public very often hears only half e facts, and the result is a

                        only one ontier--the sea - and is inclined at heart to pport the "blue-water
                        school," as if the votees of that idea-sound in itself when not
                        aggerated-covered the whole ground of liey. They forget that the British

                        little easier. The Foreign Offices have invent</p>

                        wait with honoar till the hour is favourable; and every war postponed is a
                        war which, es civilisation advances, becomes less, and not more, probable.
                        The device, though often ridiculed by political philosophers, practically
                        restrains ambitious rulers. It has, to take the best example, for at least
                        two generations prevented As between Russia and England that dreadful land
                        war for Afghanistan, which but for it might have exhausted two great
                        nations, and which, as now appears possible, may be I permanently averted.
                        That is a great good, even if we believe that as a consequence the people of
                        Afghanistan are debarred from the progress which, as provincials of Russia
                        or of Great Britain, they might have attained.</p>
                    <p>While, however, we admit this advantage to the full, and the other one apon
                        which Lord Curzon and the "Times" dwell with a kind of enthusiasm namely,
                        the development of groups of officials who are practically "Lords of the
                        Marches," and who become, in the exercise of functions requiring at once
                        civil and military ability, supreme courage, keen foresight, and a singular
                        power of tolerating the unavoidable, the most efficient of mankind - we must
                        never forget that the device tempts us to increase greatly the strain upon
                        the central authority. Every one of these "mediatised" States directly
                        enlarges the frontier of the protecting Power. It Afghanistan, for instance,
                        is attacked, we must mareh into and defend Afghanistan as determinedly as if
                        it were a county of this island. There are at least ten States which we do
                        not govern, and which yield as no revenue, but which if assailed we must
                        defend with the whole force of the nation. That is no small portion of our
                        Imperial liabilities. The United States may one day find that the defence of
                        the huge protectorate involved in her Monroe doetrine may plunge her into a
                        series of exhausting wals; while in imaginable contingencies Britain may be
                        compelled to defend Afghanistan against Russian and Chinese armies acting
                        together in pursuit of some poliey of ambition or plander. The result of
                        such a position should be an iron resolve to keep the mobile fotoes at the
                        centre, including | both the Regular Army and the fleet, equal to tasks
                        which, though they may be avoided for generations, will, when they occur,
                        unexpectedly, and will at the same time involve fully as much danger and
                        nearly as much expense as the invasion of the Motherland itaelf. It is the
                        sense of tremendous responsibility which a .. | lecture like Lord Curzon's
                        brings home to every man reads it, and it is therefore a public benefit who
                        that he should have delivered it, and, further, promptly published it in
                        pamphletform. | He is an expert, and though the British people will not
                        always follow the advice of experts, it always gains from them some addition
                        to its alas always insufficient supply of knowledge. Our people are not
                        likely to be startled by such a lecture into giving ap anything, and short
                        of that no amount of startling information et possibly have any result
                        except to increase their willingüess to make the sacrifices indispensable to
                        scientific preparation. It is well that when such information is required it
                        should be given by a man who, like Lord Curzon, is at once finished scholar,
                        adventurous explorer, and successful administrator of vast regions and
                        multitudes of various kinds of men. To have been Viceroy of India is not
                        merely claim to be heard it is to be certain that whenever it pleases him to
                        speak a fitting and a great audience will be ready to listen.</p>

                    <p>Two contemporaries have published paragraphs under the above heading stating
                        that "a further advance of L.E. 15,000 has been obtained for the erection of
                        quarters for the Sudan Government Railway staff at Atbara, and L.E. 75,000
                        for the construction of houses for officials at Khartogm and other centres."
                        This statement is not devoid of truth, but we are rather at a loss to
                        understand the renewed interest in a loan which was contracted a year
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>We use the word "loan" advisedly, for the LE. 15,000 which was obtained by
                        the Sudan Government last year at the time when the Railway Administration
                        was moving its quarters from Halfa to Atbars, was obtained from the Egyptian
                        Government at 8% interest, the payment of such interest to date from the day
                        on which the loan was granted, a very fair per centage it will be remarked
                        considering the financial aspect of the present day.</p>
                    <p>The LE. 75,000 also obtained last year, is being devoted to the building of
                        official dwellings for the whole of the provinces of the Sudan, notably
                        places such as the Bahr el Ghazal, Kordofan and Kassala, where private

                        Government is receiving 3% interest</p>
                    <p>So much for these newer loans whieh it will be seen form &amp; very excellent
                        investment for the Egyptian Government, while the Sudan Government is a
                        previously reported in our columns, this year paying back the sum of LE
                        45,000 on the one and half million of capital advanced in previous

                        arrival in the Capital yesterday morning. Though his Highness was not due to
                        arrive until 11.30, large crowds had collected in the streets fully an hour
                        before that time, and at 11 o'clock it was almost im possible to make one's
                        way along the pavements. The streets which had been newly sanded, were of

                        arrival drew near. There were also large numbers of people in the vicinity

                        Bey were drawn up out side facing the main entrance, while in the station
                        itselt, the scarlet covered platform was crowded with officials and

                        states that the Eridia and Semna properties, owned by the Eridia (Egypt)

                        date of the last report, bave reverted to this company during the period
                        under review, ow ing to the inability of certain parties to fulfil their
                        obligations to find further working capital. This company thus gets these
                        properties back with the benefit of some £23,000 spent in development upon
                        them. The Atallah Mine is still held by the Central Egypt Exploration Co.
                        (Ltd.), and this company's interest consists of 35,000 fully-paid shares out
                        of a total issued capital of £121,232, and a First Mortgage Debenture of
                        £1,000. Independent reports made last year on the group of mines by Messrs.
                        John Taylor and Sons and Messrs. Merricks, Crane, and Co., fully endorse the
                        favourable opinion formed by the company's superintend ing engineer. They
                        all agree in recommending the formation of a large mining and milling
                        company, with a working capital of £150,000, to acquire the three mines and
                        transport the ore to the Nile for crushing. It has not been possible to
                        bring out such a company during the past year. The available cash resources
                        of the company are exhausted, and it is necessary that funds should at once
                        be provided to take up these promising mines and carry on the work in a
                        modified form until such time as working capital can be raised for the
                        larger company. The board recommend that a new company be formed, to be
                        called the Egyp tian Mines Development Co. (Ltd.), with a capital of
                        £60,000, divided into 240,000 shares of 5s each, and that 215,000 shares be
                        issued to the present shareholders, share for share, with the sum of 1s per
                        share credited as paid, and a liability of 48 per share to be called up.</p>

                    <head>STATE TELEGRAPHS.<lb/>THE STAFFS PETITION.</head>
                    <p>The petition recently submitted by the staff of the State Telegraphs to the
                        Inspector General is receiving full consideration and the reasonable demands
                        of the men will be met as far as is possible in accordance with the exist
                        ing state of Departmental Pinances.</p>
                    <p>The petition comprised the following demands:</p>
                    <p>(1) Reduction of service hours to six.</p>
                    <p>(2) The granting of one weekly holiday, and a month ordinary leave.</p>
                    <p>(3) The raising of their salaries and a grant of a month extra pay similarly
                        in other Government employés.</p>
                    <p>(1) Making the precedence of service the principal base for promotion,
                        capacity to be considered without prejudice to precedence.</p>
                    <p>(5) That pension be counted for Hors Cadre years of service, the clerks
                        paying contribution to pension for same.</p>
                    <p>(6) The granting ot free uniforms, as the case sf the Railway staff with an
                        addition to the salaries of those renting houses at the rate of 20%</p>
                    <p>(7) That Arabic be the official language of the Department.</p>
                    <p>The first demand cannot of course be met in its entirety, such a regulation
                        would mean doubling the staff of the smaller offices in the provinces, a
                        proceeding which would certainly mot be justified, or the early closing of
                        such offices which would disorgainise the whole working of the Department
                        and is naturally impossible. Where it is possible to reduce the hours
                        without affecting the working of the Department every consideration will be
                        made for the employés, and it must be remembered that in such small offices
                        where the staff is not arge enough to permit of any change, the work is
                        light and for a great part of the day the clerk is more or less free, though
                        he is haturally called upon to reinain within call of his machine. The same
                        argument applies to the second article in the petition and thongh the leave
                        at present granted is undoubtedly mall, the employés are frequently
                        permitted to take an extra day off here and there, while they also have the
                        advantage of being able to obtain free passes on the State Railways,
                        privilege of considerable advantages</p>
                    <p>The question of bonus brought forward under he third demand is one which
                        would ppear to us to be reasonable enough. We are lways at a loss to
                        understand why the techsical departments of the Government whose vork is
                        usually more protracted in addition to equiring more training than is
                        necessary in he other departments, should not at least be laced upon an
                        equal footing with them as egards pay and bonuses.</p>
                    <p>The ordinary clerk at the ministries works for an average of four and a half
                        hours a day year in and year out while the clerks in the technical
                        department are for the most part required to work more than double that
                        time, and are then the only department to be denied a bonus when it is being
                        given to the others.</p>
                    <p>The position of the telegraphists has much improved during late years,
                        formerly they were started upon a monthly salary of L. E. 3 whereas at the
                        present time they start at L.E. 5 and the average pay of the department is
                        not bad, but we can see no reason whatever why they should be denied a bonus
                        which is considered necessary to the others.</p>
                    <p>The fourth demand appears to be somewhat unnecessary considering that
                        precedence is, and always has been the principal base for promotion and it
                        is only in cases where excep tional capacity has been displayed by an
                        employé that he has been promoted over the heads of his seniors, in this
                        there can be no possible alteration which would be to the mutual benefit of
                        department and employes</p>
                    <p>We entirely sympathize with the demand made in the fifth article. It is far
                        from right that a man who has worked to the satisfaction of his employers
                        for an indefinite time on probation should be foreed to begin again as it
                        were in the same department when he gets on to the pension list, and we
                        trust that this point will receive the favourable notice of the Admi-
                        nistration.</p>
                    <p>Articles six and seven are not serious ones, and will probably receive no
                        attention. As a matter of fact the question of uniforms was gone into some
                        time back when the men refused an offer made to them by the department of
                        the same nature as that of the one they now demand.</p>
                    <p>We will await with interest the reply which will be made to the petition,
                        money is scaree in all departments this year and it can hardy be expected
                        that a material advance can be made on existing salaries even if any is made
                        at all, but we trust that the question of bonuses will be settled to the
                        advantage of the telegraph employes. It is a hard working department and one
                        where skill is an essential. This fact should not be lost sight of when
                        allotting the various sums for distribution as bonus among the departments
                        of the Government.</p>

                    <p>EXCHANGE OF SPECIE</p>
                    <p>The total of specie imported last month was L.B. 8,192,511 as compared with
                        LE. 4,710,889 in October 1906. During the first ten months of the year the
                        import of specie was LB 6,110,135 as compared with LE 6,478,911 in the
                        corresponding period of last year. Of the LE 6,110,185 imported between
                        January and October 31, LB 4,017,528 came from Turkey and LE 1,208,776 from
                        England. It will thus be seen that the imports of gold for the first two
                        months of the new cotton year show a decrease of two millions sterling and
                        justify the estimates which we formed two months back of the amount of six
                        millions of gold required to move the cotton.</p>

                        4,663,831 and L.E 2,015,007, respectively for 1907 and 1906. Of the exported

                        <p>The entertainment given at Neosis on the th instant by the Cyprus Amateur
                            Dramatic Bociety was distinct succes somewhat over 100 persons accepted
                            the invitations sent out, and there, together with the member of the
                            society made up a fairly numerous audience For a private performance.
                            Thanks to the pourtesy of the Committee of the Girl School,</p>
                        <p>most suitable hall has been placed at the Hisposal of the Society for
                            their entertainments, and the latter, through the ingenuity and energy
                            of one of its members. has constructed</p>
                        <p>fair sized, easily removable stage so that, For future occasions, little
                            expense or trouble in this account will be incurred.</p>
                        <p>The first part of the programme consisted of music and recitations, and
                            opened with "A Japanese Love Song," delightfully sung by Mrs. Bertram,
                            and charmingly illustrated by Mrs. P. Christianas Japanese maid on a
                            fan," and by Mr. MacDonald as a Chinaman "on &amp; whest of tes." The
                            scene was appropriately met, and, by the combined efforts of the three
                            performers the audience was at once put into a good humour for the rest
                            of the evening. This was followed by songs from Col Gore, Mrs. Casolani,
                            who received a well-deserved encore, he Rev. P. Lt. Edwards, and Miss
                            Wodehouse.</p>
                        <p>The audience greatly appreciated a second ong from Mrs. Bertram "God's
                            Slumber and," accompanied on the violin with much lelicacy and feeling
                            by Miss I. Spencer. A onspicuous feature of the programme was a
                            monologue by Mrs. Bevan, entitled "A Woman</p>
                        <p>f Courage" (Mn. Hugh Bell). This was a veritable tour de force and Mrs.
                            Bevan, whose memory never failed her for an instant,</p>
                        <p>eld her hearers from start to finish, and gained their well-merited
                            applause. The first part of the programme concluded with a musical ketch
                            by Mr. Saxby. This gentleman, a new rrival in Cyprus, has conspicuous
                            musical bility and showed himself possessed of a emarkable fund of that
                            peculiar quality of umour which accords so well with and can be ptly
                            illustrated by musie. It was a most amusng and enjoyable little sketoh,
                            penetasted as was by a finished manipulation of the piano, und
                            thoronghly delighted the audience.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the entertainment consisted of the picturesque,
                            old-fashionable little play "Popping the Question." The story is of a
                            certain Henry Primrose, an elderly bachelor, who decided, late in life,
                            to take a wife and seeks the hand of his young ward Ellen Murray. That
                            young lady, however, is in love with a certain Henry Thornton, more of
                            her own age. Owing to the ambiguous manner in which her guardian
                            proposes, she mischievously agrees to be married to "her dear Henry,"
                            meaning, of course, the younger man, leaving Mr. Primrose under the
                            impression that she had accepted him. Meanwhile two elderly spinsters,
                            Miss Biffin and Miss Winterblossom, both of whom have set their caps at
                            this nice, prim, clean' old gentleman, are consulted by the latter upon
                            the matrimonial step he con templates taking. Each one believes he is
                            proposing to her and eagerly accepts his proposal before he bas time to
                            fully explain himself. He mistakes their ready concurrence for
                            acquiescence in his engagement to Ellen Murray, and thus we have all the
                            material for a general confusion of aims and intentions. An excellent
                            scene takes place between the two elderly spinsters, inimitably acted by
                            Mrs, George Smith, and Miss A. Spencer, both of whom entered heartily
                            into the spirit of the play, and both by words and action rendered their
                            parts most admirably. Amusing scenes took place between them and Mr.
                            Primrose (Mr. Bevan), who is the pivot on which the piece turns. Miss I.
                            Spencer and Mr. Cade acted the parts of Ellen Murray, and Henry Thornton
                            with intelligence and excellent effect, while Bobbin (Mrs. Christian)
                            discharged her duties as maid, familiar friend, and the good or evil
                            genius of the play with liveliness and 'gusto.'</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "Egyptian Gazette” Dear Sir,</p>
                    <p>The need of an organization to foster British trade abroad, and to protect
                        the interests of British communities overseas, has long been experienced.
                        Having no Parliamentary Repre sentative, Britons, on leaving England, have
                        practically no means of making their voice heard, and too often find their
                        needs neglected. The Overseas League will help them by ventil ating, and
                        obtain redress for, legitimate grievances as occasion arises,</p>
                    <p>The offices of the Overseas Lengue are at Caxton Hall, Westminister, London,
                        &amp;.W.</p>
                    <p>The Overseas League proposes to further the interest of British subjects
                        resident in foreign Countries, and to promote British trade. The League will
                        also make known the wants of British colonists oversens; and in general will
                        seek to foster the welfare of the Empireber The Overseas League will use
                        every constitu tional means to achieve these objects, and invites the
                        support of persons of all shades of political opinion.</p>
                    <p>Trusting that your readers will cooperate in the accomplishment of these
                        pins, since it is only by advancing British trades that we can hope to
                        retain our proud place among the Nations of the world.</p>

                    <p>Les Dividendes Tramways d'Alexandrie per dent 5 francs à 260 et les
                        Jouissances Eaux du Caire 10 francs à 175. La Banque d'Athènes fléchit de
                        108 107 1/2 et les Nungovich Hotels de 16 1/2 à 16 3.8.</p>
                    <p>En revanche, les Lots Turcs reprennent de 157 à 158 et la Banque d'Orient de
                        111 1/2 à 112.</p>
                    <p>Dans la catégorie des petites valeurs, la Salt and Soda remonte de 15/- á
                        15/3, la Cassa di Soonto de 43 à 44, la Delta Land de 1 1/4 à 19/32, les
                        Estates de 13/32 à 7/16, le Comptoir de ? 8/8 à 2 7/16, l'United de 7/32
                        &amp; 1/4 et la Zariffa de 2 7/8 à 3. C'est à dire que dans cette catégorie
                        il n'y a que des ainéliorations à si-| gnaler.</p>
                    <p>Si donc il fallait s'en rapporter à la cote, il y a dans l'ensemble des
                        fluctuations l'indication évidente d'une amélioration. Ceux qui prennent au
                        sérieux cette petite reprise l'attribuent au raffermissement des places
                        dirigeantes et au bas niveau que nous avons atteint.</p>
                    <p>Nous croyons, en effet, que ce changement de capitalisation, au moins en ce
                        qui concerne nos bonnes valeurs, ne peut que leur être favorable dans un
                        avenir plus ou moins éloigné, dès que les bourses européennes nous auront
                        montré le chemin d'une reprise définitive.</p>
                    <p>A ce sajet il n'est pas hors de propos de signaler une opinion, qui prend de
                        jour en jour plus de consistance et d'après laquelle bon nombre de nos
                        courtiers maneuvreraient sur les dossiers de leurs clients. Nombre d'entre
                        eux, ayant vendu des paquets de titres ne leur appartenant pas se
                        trouveraient à découvert. Ceux qui répandentoe bruit vont jusqu'à dire que
                        la récepte hausse aurait été occasionnée par les rachats de ce découvert. Et
                        ces fructueuses opérations se pratiqueraient couramment à Londres et à
                        Paris. Nous donnons l'information sans nous en porter garant; mais si
                        certains de nos agents avaient jusqu'à ce point perdu la notion de leurs
                        devoirs, il est clair qu'ils s'exposeraient ainsi à une catastrophe qui
                        n'entrainerait pas seulement leur ruine, mais encore celle de leurs
                        clients.</p>

                    <p>Veut-on savoir quelles sont les raisons des difficultés monétaires que nous
                        subissons et la cause de la ténacité de nos banques à refuser tous crédits
                        ?</p>
                    <p>"A côté de la chasse à l'or, dit le "Moniteur des Intérêts Matériels" une
                        autre cause de préoccupation pour les banques occidentales est la nécessité
                        de payer, d'ici à denx mois, la contre-valeur des céréales et des
                        marchandises qai débarqueront d'Egypte et des Etats-Unis. En temps normal
                        ces remises nécessaires se font sur une plus longue période, parce qu'elles
                        sont en partie anticipées sous forme d'escompte de ce papier de banque, de
                        ces traites, qui ne sont pas.commerciales, ne sont pas accompagnées de
                        connaissements, mais qui n'en servent pas moins à régler des opérations de
                        commerce international. Mais, depuis six mois surtout, les banques
                        d'émission ont proscrit le plus possible ce papier de banque, qu'il vienne
                        d'Egypte, de l'Argentine, ou de New-York; on 8 fait la guerre à ce papier,
                        parce qu'on voulait la faire aus tirages qui n'avaient rien de commercial et
                        parce qu'il y avait impossibilité de distinguer les unes des autres des
                        traites de banque constituant des tirages pour se procurer de l'argent et
                        d'autres traites qui formaient le règlemeat anticipé d'une marchandise dont
                        l'expédition allait suivre.</p>
                    <p>"On a donc des motifs de croire que la matière escomptable régulière, saine,
                        va être plus abondante qu'elle l'est d'habitude en ces deux mois de novembre
                        et de décembre, toujours très chargés d'échéances et de besoins momentanés.
                        C'est un second élément délicat de la situation actuelle."</p>
