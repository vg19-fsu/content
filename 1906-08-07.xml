                    <head>A SUICIDAL POLICY</head>
                    <p>Ministers are losing no time in giving practical effect to the policy which,
                        according to Mr. Haldane, will have the double advantage of inviting other
                        Powers to a reduction oi armaments while increasing the fighting value of
                        our own by fifty per cent. Oa Saturday week, then, in pursuance of that
                        policy, the third Battalion of the Scots Guards surrendered its colours to
                        the King, and ceased to exist in its corporate capacity. The parade was,
                        naturally enough, made as private an affair as possible; it was not a
                        ceremony which anyone present, from His Majesty down to the smallest
                        band-boy, could regard as a combination of duty with pleasure. Never the
                        ass, for our part, says the "PallMa'l Gazette,' we should not have been
                        sorry if the King had invested the ceremony with every attribute of
                        publicity, and had held the parade in Hyde Park before the eye3 of assembled
                        London. It would, in our judgment, have been a very good thing to have
                        brought home visibly—"because things seen are mightier than things heard"—to
                        the people the fact that our present pastors and masters are dshborately
                        wipeg out of existence a whole battalion of the finest troops in the world,
                        and that this is but the first stop in a process of wholesale disarmament
                        such aa has never been witnessed before in the history of -he British Army.
                        Had the public been present we doubt not that many hearts would have echoed
                        the words reported to have been used by an ofli cer who saw the Battalion
                        pass on<cb n="6"/> its march to Buckingham Palaca. "Please God we never want
                        in a hurry what we are throwing away in a hurry. " Of the opinion
                        entertained by the King as to the wisdom of the polioy of relnotion, some
                        idea' maybe formed from the striotly constitutional terms in which his
                        Majesty referred to that policy: "My Government has considered it neoessary
                        to reduce the expense! of the Army." There was, moreover, a note of resur
                        rection in his Majesty's declaration that he would receive tin colours
                        rather as a deposit than as a gift: 'I shall always preserve them
                        religiously and carefully at Buckingham Palace, aa I hope that it may be
                        possible for me, or at any rate my successor, to see a third Battalion of
                        the Scots G jards carrying tin ^ame colours again." Unless, then, we are to
                        assume that Edward the Peacemaker has been suddenly smitten with the madness
                        of "militarism," we must conclada that he, at all events, does not believe
                        that the Golden Age isaboat to return, and that England and her Sovereign
                        can safely dispense with the services of any appreciable portion of the
                        British Armyx However, the King reigns, and good Sir Henry governs. "The
                        British infantry are the finest in the world ; fortunately there are very
                        few of them," said Marsh*! Bugeand. They will now be fewer still; but
                        whether fortanately or unfortunately depends, of coarse, on the point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>It is a wholesome exercise for a natioD, as for an individual, to try to Bee
                        itself aa others see it, especially when the nation in question lives on an
                        island, and is therefore rather prone to the habit of mental isolation. Let
                        os sae then, what our neighbours thiuk of our policy of Daval and military
                        reduction, or, at least, of the naval part of the business for they have
                        already expressed themselves with regard to the other. Three points emerge
                        from the comments of the French and German Press, and of Count Reventlow„
                        the German naval expert, who has expressed his opinion in an interview. In
                        the first place, British Daval reduotion will amount to very little.
                        Secondly, British naval supremacy is so well assured for the immediate
                        future that England can well afford to p03e as the Angel of Peace. Thirdly,
                        that, whatever England may consider herself justified in doing in this
                        direition, neither France nor Germany has the faintest intention of
                        following snit. That, then, is the brutal, naked truth ; nobody is going to
                        follow our lead, because, to begin with, onr reductions ate considered quite
                        inadequate to affect the existing balance of naval power, and because, if
                        they were not, nobody would be so foolish not to take advantage cf British
                        ineptitude for his own benefit. It comes, therefore, to thip, that England
                        is to appear before the Conference at The Hague to ask the other Powers as
                        to follow her example by reduoing their armaments, albeit (by her own
                        admission) she has not made any reductions snffi.ient to endanger her own
                        naval supremacy—a fact of which her neighbours are perfeotly well aware. We
                        find ourselves, then, between the horns of a dilemma ; either our redaction
                        of armaments is a sham, or it is fraught with danger to oar supremacy on sea
                        and to the adequate defence of the Empire on land. We cannot have it both
                        w*ys; but unfortunately, that is jast what thaGovernmentare trying todo, and
                        the attempt has this peril in it, that in striving to offer the Conference
                        at The Hague convincing proof of their burning zeal for peace, they will
                        serionsly impair the national strength both afloat and ashore, thereby
                        merely tempting our rivals to redouble their efforts to overtake us. The
                        value of the British Navy as a fictor in the preservation of peace doas not
                        consist ia mere ability to fight, but in being so unquestionably powerful
                        that no Power, or combination of Powers, shall dare try conclusions with it.
                        The nation, careless and apathetic though it is, really knows that well
                        enough, and, if the Government do not, we have good hope that the Conference
                        at The Hague will convince them that other Powers do not mean to leave off
                        shipbuilding to please the one Great Power in Earope which "seeks no
                        territories" and only desires to koep what it has got. The voios of England
                        is merely that of one crying in tha wilderness.</p>

                    <p>MENEL1K INTERFERES IN FAVOUR OF A GERMAN. </p>
                    <p>The Berlin "LokalaDzeiger" recently publish ed a communication on German
                        infience in Abyssinia which has been widely quoted in the German Press,
                        generally accompanied by com ments to the effeot that the .Emperor Menelik
                        has more respect for Germany than lor any other Power. The communication
                        states that he commercial treaty which was concluded between Germany and
                        Abyssinia, as a result of Geheimrat Rosen's mission to the Abyssinian Court
                        last year, is a great improvement on the commercial treaty concluded between
                        other European Powers and Abyssinia, inasmuch as it exempts German sabjects
                        in Abyssinia from the jarisdiotion of native Abyssinian courts •»nd places
                        them under German consular juris- liction. The subjects of all other Powers
                        in Abyssinia are placed under the jurisdiction of the Abyssinian courts, and
                        are thus subjected to a most inadequate and unfair administration ofjastioe.
                        The communication conclude! with describing a case which occarred iu the
                        interior of Abyssinia, where a German trader was greatly •annoyed and
                        harassed in his business operations by the local Abyssinian chieftain. The
                        Genian Charge dAffaires at Adis Abeba lodged an energetic protest, and
                        Menelik immediately ordered that the tff-jnding chiePain -hoald be deposed.
                        This drastic punishment, says the communication, is unique in the records of
                        Abyssinian relations with foreign Powers, and excited great astonishment
                        among the Englith and French rebdents at 'Adis Abeba. </p>

                        becomes vacant this week, when Sergeant-Major Shipley, ot the 1st Battalion,
                        leaves to take up au appointment at the Royal Hibernian School.</p>
                    <p>Representations were made to the regimental orderly-room that it would be
                        unwise to promote a non-commissioned officer in his place in view of the
                        fact that there wouli be within the next few months a warrant officer to be
                        absorbed from the 3rd Battalion. The matter was taktn to higher quarters,
                        and the decision since couimuuicated is that the senior drill- eergeant of
                        the 2nd Battalion is to be promoted sergeant major of the 1st Battalion, and
                        his appointment is to be fi'led without delay. This, taken in conjunction
                        with the faot that officers are advising their non commissioned officers to
                        "soldier or," is significant; the married people of the 3rd Battalion are
                        being told that they ceed not fear that their stay in Egypt will be as brief
                        as present circumstances indicate. All these things certainly give an
                        impression that there are powerful agencies at work to save at least one of
                        the two threatened battalions.</p>

                    <p>FIRST SHIFMENT TO THIS COUNTRY IN ABOUT EIGHT YEAR3. </p>
                    <p>Baltimore, July 7. A character of unusual interest has been noted on 'Change.
                        The British steamer Mookta haR Iren engaged to carry a full cargo of corn
                        this month to Alexandria. It is understood that Messrs. Hammond and Snydor
                        are the shippers </p>
                    <p>It has been seven or eight years since Baltimore has shipped corn to Egypt.
                        Some time ago many shipments were made. It is not believed that the present
                        shipment means in any sense a revival of this trade, but that it is rather a
                        freak.</p>
                    <p>It is also rather unusual for a full cargo of corn to be shipped from this
                        port in July. DariDg the past winter it was known that there were many
                        charters for July and August, but these were for the most part canceled. It
                        is rumoured, however, that there will be several large shipments during
                        August.</p>

                    <head>THE DENISHWAI AFFAIR.<lb/>THE CHARGES OF BRIBERY</head>
                    <p>The discussion aroused by the charges of bribery brought by Mr. Mansfield de
                        C. Findlay against the European and native Press still continues in the
                        vernacular newspapers. Meanwhile the European newspapers, whose attitude
                        during the Denishwai campaign led to their being included in Mr. Findlay's
                        accusation, also intend moving in the matter. The "Journal du Caire''
                        yesterday remarked:</p>
                    <p>Toute la presse s'apprête à répondre à l'accusation grave dont elle vient
                        d'être l'objet. Mais il faut y mettre quelque perspicacité et à propos.
                        C'est une injure qui comporte une justification publique.</p>
                    <p>"Al Zaher" makes the following comments : —Not long ago Lord Cromer abused
                        the Moslem papers, ascribing untruthfulness to their statements, because
                        they published what they considered to be the trnth in regard to the Akaba
                        affair ; and now Mr. Findlay, the British Chargé d'Affaires, brings charges
                        of bribery against the local Press —both European and native—for their
                        publications regarding the Denishwai affair. Both Mr. Findlay and Lord
                        Cromer have coloured their assertions with serious exaggeration. Mr.
                        Findlay's charges are, we believe, baseless. They are merely a result of
                        some political views. He who allows himself to charge the Egyptian Press
                        with corruption for criticising the Denishwai sentence may just as well
                        bring the same charges against those Members of Parliament who severely
                        criticised this identical sentence, declaring that it was based on neither
                        justice nor law. If any bribes at all were given to newspapers as a subsidy,
                        those papers must undoubtedly be two: one European and the other Arabic.</p>
                    <p>"Al Ahram" says Mr. Findlay is very much mistaken in levelling charges of
                        bribery against the European and native Press of Egypt in general. "We never
                        expected to hear such charges from such a capable man as Mr. Findlay is. "We
                        cannot, therefore, help criticizing the extraordinary policy of this
                        gentleman, but at the same time we must acknowledge the violent tone of some
                        of our papers. What proof could Mr. Findlay bring to show that his curious
                        charges are true ? Who are the natives who have so generously spent the
                        large sum of money which should be enough to subsidize the whole of the
                        papers of Egypt ? It is unjust to despise the papers which render the best
                        services to the country and whose assistance had been appreciated by Lord
                        Cromer himself. If Mr. Findlay will deign to listen to the opinion of a
                        paper which has served the Egyptian nation for 30 years, "Al-Ahram'' will
                        take the liberty to point out that the British Occupation has exaggerated
                        the charges of religious fanaticism and brought the last charges of bribery
                        against the whole of the Egyptian Press only to pave the way for some future
                        line of policy and to suppress the liberty of the Press. But the slightest
                        diminution of that liberty will be considered as a crime committed against
                        the nation, which hears no voice except that of its Press."</p>

                        PEACE.</head>
                    <p>The Armerian Orthodox colony at Alexandria is still agitated on the subject
                        of its constitution. The recent crisis, which led to the resignation of
                        Bartau Pasha and his nominees, is by no means at an end, and the elebtions
                        have led to no result, for the members of the new council resigned one after
                        another, for reasons which are not exactly known, and no council now
                        exists.</p>
                    <p>We hear that the Egyptian Government has informed the leaders of the party
                        which deposed Bartau Pasha, that until the return of Boghos Pasha Nubar from
                        Europe matters had better remain in statu quo.</p>
                    <p>The Orthodox Armenian Patriarchate at Constantinople has sent an official
                        communication to the old council, of which Bartan Pasha was president. The
                        text of this document is as follows :--</p>
                    <p>By your letter, dated 30th June, you inform us that according to our latest
                        instructions you continue temporarily to hold your office, but that you do
                        not take part, within the jurisdic tion of the archbishopric, in the
                        meetings the aim of which is to form a provincial administra- tion. As you
                        are aware, according to instruc- tion issued by this Patriarchate, the
                        Bishop of your See, Mgr. Megherditch, was entrusted with the election of a
                        local board for Alexandria, by sending us in advance a report concerning the
                        electoral preparations. We are, however, astonished to hear that instead of
                        having a local board elected, the Bishop has proceeded to form a separate
                        General Provincial Assem- bly for Alexandria, as if that town were a
                        detached and independent See from that of Egypt in general. The Bishop
                        brings forward, in order to exculpate himself, varions excuses and also
                        certain influence which have been brought to bear upon him. In the Mixed
                        Council of the Central National Administration this action of the Bishop's
                        was discussed, and the Mixed Council did not consider that this proceeding
                        was in any way legal:</p>
                    <p>1. Because the Bishop had no order but to form a Local Board, and it was
                        beyond his powers to undertake other duties.</p>
                    <p>2. Because the grant to Alexandria of a pro- vincial general assembly and an
                        administrative body of her own wou'd mean a division into two parts of the
                        See of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>It is natural that the National Central Admi- nistration could not accept
                        such a separatist body, which is contrary to our traditional rules and to
                        our national constitution. The adminis- tration, moreover, could not
                        understand how the Bishop, who ho'ds his authority from this Patriarchate,
                        and is recognized as such before the local authorities by an Imperial
                        Firmar, could infringe the instructions of our Patriar- chate, the canons of
                        our Holy Church, and the laws of our nation, by acting in such a way. The
                        Bishop must well bear in mind that Alexandria forms only a part of the
                        Egyptian See, although certainly an important part. She is entitled to have
                        her own representatives in the General Provincial Assembly in Cairo, which
                        city is Egypt's diplomatic centre and the seat of the See, and to elect by
                        scrutiny her own local board, which in its turn is responsible to the Civil
                        Council, constitated by the general provincial assembly in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The National Central Administration could, if needs be, allow the Alexandrian
                        community, in view of their increased number, to have a number of
                        representatives equal to that of Cairo, thus possessing a voice and a vote,
                        according to their position, in the administra- tion of the general affairs
                        of the See. Such is the legal manner of the administrative bodies in all
                        Sees, and all special instructions are based on these principles. The
                        arrangements made by the Bishop are evasions of the law and render him
                        responsible, a responsibility which is the more serious as it is tantamoun
                        to separating the only See in Egypt. Th duties of the Bishop are, therefore,
                        to make his arrangements by taking as a base the identical legal principle
                        as explained heretoe fore. He should in the second place enter into
                        negociation with the General Provincial- Assembly in Cairo, and come to a
                        complete understanding with these two great parties of the Egyptian See in
                        Cairo and Alexandria. He ought not to assume a needless responsi- bility by
                        giving an appearance of legality to his arbitrary proceedings.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, have transmitted to the Bishop of Egypt these remarks of the
                        National Central Administration, and have recom- mended him to act in a
                        legal manner, and to submit to the Central Administration such sound
                        proposals as will be always attended to, provided that they do not infringe
                        the tradi- tional law and the principles of our National Constitution as
                        concerns the organisation of Sees.</p>
                    <p>Whereas the Provincial General Assembly in Cairo have a voice in this
                        question of administrative organization, and whereas every arrangement
                        should be made after a good understanding has been arrived at, we have
                        counselled the Bishop to await the return of the president of the Provincial
                        General Assembly, H.E. Boghos Pasha Nubar, and not to embark in hasty
                        measures, the consequences of which might be prejudicial. We at the same
                        time draw the attention of our Alex- andria compatriots, who have shown
                        them- selves so attached to the law, in order that they shall know to
                        hearken to the remarks of the Central Administration with the same loyal
                        spirit. It is sufficient if the Bishop explains formally and intelligibly
                        these dispositions of the law, without any hesitation or weakness,
                        whatsoever exigencies may arise. Furthermore, and lastly, we urge the
                        honourable Council to give ear to the observations of the Central
                        Administration and to use their best endea- vours so that the affairs of the
                        diocese may be placed on a legal foundation and that peace and harmony may
                        thereby be attained. (Signed) MALACHIA.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that this communication of the Patriarch of Constantinople, whose
                        hierarchical jurisdiction embraces the ancient See of Egypt, will be
                        received by the Orthodox Armenian community of Alexandria with all the defe-
                        rence due to the exalted ecclesiastical rank of the reverend author, and
                        that the unfortunate friction that has recently taken place will now be at
                        an end, so that when Boghos Pasha Nubar returns from Europe he will find it
                        an easy task to conciliate all the contending factions.</p>

                    <head>FANATICISM IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>MU ST A I'll A KASHA KAMEI.'S OPINION.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel sends the following letter to the "Tribune":</p>
                    <p>Now that Egypt and the Egyptians are so much discussed in England, permit me
                        to say a word npon a question which we, more than all others, naturally have
                        at heart.</p>
                    <p>Sir Edward Grey having spoken in the House of Commons of the alleged
                        fanaticism of the Egyptians, the English people ask how it is possible th it
                        each fanaticism can exist after twenty four years of British occupation. And
                        they are right in their surprise, inasmuch as "fanaticism" means, in
                        European ears, love of barbarism and hatred of Christians. If snch a feeling
                        existed in Egypt, it would imply the downfall of the English Administration
                        and o* European civilization on Egyptian soil.</p>
                    <p>Bat, by the leave of Lord Cromer and Sir Edward Grey, that fanaticism has DO
                        existence. There is, indeed, a national movement, bat not a fanatical
                        movement. There is a national movement that shoald be approved by all j net
                        and hnmane men, for its aim is to set Egypt QDder a liberal rale that would
                        permit free iife on the banks of the Nile, and would allow effort, talent,
                        and industry their due success. We have, in fact, long made our device of
                        the words, "Liberty for ourselves, a welcome for the stranger."</p>
                    <p>If some Englishmen have forgotten the engagements entered into by the British
                        Government—the promise of "Egypt for the Egyptians"—the Egyptians have not
                        forgotten it. Independence wap, and ip, the supreme aspiration of our lives.
                        It is Baid—and said assuredly in bad faith - that we do but wish to change
                        oar masters, and that we are led captive by Tarkish intrigue, or by German,
                        as the case may be. The same thing was said when France urged the evacnation
                        of Egypt. Bnt it is a oalamDy, and it will not hold.</p>
                    <p>Those who speak thus of us should remember that Egypt definitively accepted
                        Western civilization more than a century ago, that she is not like Morocco,
                        nor like any other nation of Africa or of Asia, and that she possesses an
                        edaoated class fully as intellectual as are the edaoated clasee* of Earope.
                        And how can Egyptians of education do otherwise than desire the liberty of
                        their conntry ? And how shoald saoh a wish seem strange to-day, which was
                        allowed to be natural and lawful a short quarter of a century ago?</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer has prodaced no proof of the fanatioism of Egypt—that
                        "lanaticism" which has so often and so long been need as a weapon against
                        ns. The only proof offered by Lord Cromer to England is the anonymous letter
                        ot a Mussulman. Is it not rather a disproof that is to be found in this
                        letter ? And wonld England have been able to place Englishmen at the head ot
                        the Egyptian State and at the head of the Egyptian Army if the Egyptian
                        people had been fanatics ? Would England have been able to lead Egyptian
                        foroes to the Sadan against the Sadane3e Mussulmans if there had been a
                        Mussulman fanatioism in Egypt ? Wonld she hava succeeded in condemning
                        twenty-one Mussulmans to terrible punishments—hangings, Hoggings, and hard
                        labour—for the accidental death of one English officer and injary to two
                        others l Was not the Denishwai inoident snffioient to provoke an outbreak of
                        fanaticism if fanatioism existed ? No, a thoosand times, it does not exist.
                        What does exist is national feeling; what does exist is bitterness that
                        justice should so fail.></p>
                    <p>It has been said in England, and repeated, that the Sinai inoident proved the
                        existence of fanatioism. And yeh, daring the whole incident, there were no
                        meetings, no demonstrations, no disturbances. A controversy in the Press
                        there was, indeed; but this was all. Is this fanaticism! And what impartial
                        Englishman will blame the interest taken by the Mussulmans of Egypt in a
                        question touching the railway of Hedjaz and the pilgrimages?</p>
                    <p>Some amoug the honest Europeans who confess oar freedom from fanatioism have
                        protested in Egyptian newspapers against the speeoh of Sir Edward Grey. I
                        believe, with my countrymen, that Sir Edward Grey spoke in Parliament of
                        Egyptian fanaticism for no other purpose than to stifle discussion on the
                        horrible facts of Denishwai. Bnt is it worthy of England, the coantry that
                        professes humanity, jastice, and oivilisation, to approve and adopt the acts
                        of those who gave the world that melancholy and dreadful spectacle of
                        barbarism—the exeoations of Denishwai?</p>

                            that the speed trals of the S.S. Imperatnl Trajan, which have been
                            carried ont at St. Nbzaire, are very satisfactory. Judging by these
                            trials, it is expected that the vessel will be able to do the voyage
                            between Constat za and Alexandria in an average of 64 hoars.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE COL. MONCRIEFF.</head>
                    <p>Colonel Sir Alexander Moncrieff, K.C.B., F.R 8., whose death is announced by
                        Renter to day, was born in 1829. DariDg the Crimean War Sir Alexander
                        Monorieff, then a lieutenant in the Forfarshire Militia, went to the seat of
                        war, and received the permission of the Commander-m-Chief to visit the siege
                        works, and to be present at the operations as a Militia officer, daring the
                        first and second bombardments of Sevastopol. It was then .that the idea of
                        the invention with which his Dame is aseociated occurred to his mind ; bnt
                        it was some years before it was matured into a praotioai form. It was first
                        submitted by Captain Monorieff to General Sir Richard Daores, Commanding tbe
                        Royal Artillery in Iceland, at Dablin in 1857, and it was some years more
                        before the authorities were induced to give it a trial, after which Captain
                        Monorieff was engaged for eight years in the Royal Arsenal attached to the
                        Department of the Direotor of Artillery. The Moncrieff System of Mounting
                        Artillery, or the protected barbette system, is sometimes called the
                        Disippearing System, because upon firing, the g^nn reooils into shelter, oat
                        of sight of the tyiemy, and the energy of tfie recoil is stored up so as to
                        raise the gnn into the firing position when loaded. la the first instance
                        this was effected by means of a connterweight; and the interposition of a
                        moving fulcrum (then for the first time employed in praotioai mechanics)
                        enabled the Bodden impetus of the discharge to be utilised without danger to
                        the carriage. Another method by which the same end is accomplished, and
                        which is applicable to sea service, and to many oases in which the direct
                        foroe of gravity wonld be unwieldy or nnsnitable for application, is
                        MonoriefFs Hydro pneumatic System. In this case the recoil of the gan drives
                        down a piston, which foroes water into a vessel of compressed air,and the
                        farther compression of the air stores up the energy of the recoil to raise
                        the gn n to the firing position when required. His system is now largely and
                        increasingly nsed i n tfce British Service, both by land and sea; and it is
                        nsed also by foreign Governments.</p>

                    <head>HUNGARY'S PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS.</head>
                    <p>Scientists are now very busy in Hungary attempting to explain the reason for
                        the unprecedented visitation of an army of locusts. The damage done by the
                        loonsts iB at the moment impossible to be ganged. No one nnacqoainted with
                        the devastating possibilities of these winged pests woald for a moment
                        imagine that they, and they alone, were responsible for so much wholesale
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>One could not believe one's own eyes. Everything they swooped upon perished
                        as at the hand of a ruthless invading army. An eyewitness told me of a
                        darkened sky, as if the night had suddenly enveloped them. The whole thing
                        is in the nature of a calamity. The Pnpzfa, or great Hungarian plain, and in
                        particular Hortobagy, near Debrecen, is now in a state of cattle fodder
                        famine.</p>
                    <p>Specialists suggest that the locusts came from Morocco, but it is the huge
                        number which has baffled their scientific skill, they are computed to be at
                        thousands of billions. Their task of destroying 18,000 square kilometres of
                        highly productive land was most successfully accomplished. Barley, wheat,
                        rye, maize, and also beetroot and turnips, all come within their scheme of
                        destruction, and in some cases they ate away even to the roots.</p>
                    <p>The damage, though only dimly understood at present, is considered to be
                        enormous. Unfortunately, the loousts are likely to remain in the conntry for
                        another fortnight, as they have j ust laid their eggs. The direction now
                        taken by them is towards Balmaz"j 'kros and ilajdubuszormdny.</p>

                    <head>CAPE CAIRO RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT. </head>
                    <p>The munificent bequest of the late Mr- Alfred Beit for the furtherance of Mr.
                        Rhodes's great scheme for a railway to cross Africa from sooth to north has
                        brought the aoco!h plishment of the scheme very appreciably nearer. At the
                        present time the line stretches from Capetown to nearly 300 miles north of
                        the great Victoria Falls, and is rapidly approaching the boundary of the
                        Congo Free State through which it will probably pass on its way northwards
                        though this is not yet definitely settled, and there is an alternative
                        scheme for the line to follow the trans African telegraph wire through
                        German East Afrioa. Roughly speaking, and taking Capetown BB the
                        starting-point of the line, 2,f00 miles of railway have now been completed,
                        and as a result of Mr. Beit's brquest (the "Morning Post" states) the rate
                        of progress in construo tion will be greatly stimulated. Hitherto the line
                        has been built in separate sections, following the policy laid down by Mr.
                        Rhodes several years ago. These sections are about 1,000 miles in length,
                        and each ope is taken in hand by itself, the capital is raised for it, and
                        the construction carried forward with a view to enabling it to pay its own
                        way, without reference to the rest of the line, at the earliest possible
                        moment. With the million sterling that Mr, Beit has left at their command
                        those in charge of the constrnotion will no longer find their hands tied and
                        their work impeded through lack of funds, so that a very great difficulty
                        will have been removed from their path.</p>
                    <p>Years ago, when he was first sketching out his plans for the line, Mr. Rhodes
                        foresaw trouble in raising the capital necessary for the construction and
                        maintenance of the portions of the railway tjiat passed through the interior
                        "In Rhodesia and for some d'sffanpe nor!h ot the Zambesi," he said in
                        effect, "there is something tangible to offer to investors. There are the
                        goldfields of Rhodesia and there are the Wankie ooaifield at the Victoria
                        Falls and the rich and extensive copper deposits in Northern Rhodesia. But
                        once you are beyond these regions and have plunged into the almost unknown
                        interior, wbat have you to offer a man in older to induce him to put his
                        money into ihe scheme ?" This trouble has now, to a very large extent, at
                        all events, been removed, and appropriately enough, by Mr. Rhodes' old
                        friend and partner. It is very probable that the whole cf the money left to
                        the railway by Mr. Beit will be devoted to buildiDg the line through thr se
                        regions which offer no immediate prospect of paying their way, and that the
                        Chartered Company will continue to guarantee the capital necessary for the
                        sections where good returns are to be looked for under similar terms to
                        those portions that have already been laid and opened for traffic. The Beit
                        bequest makes it absolutely certain tljat the line will be completed in its
                        entirety and that,moreover, within a comparatively sh'ort time. It has come
                        just at the right moment, and will enable the work to be poshed forward with
                        undiminished energy.</p>
                    <p>At present the rai'head is in the neighborhood of the Broken Hill district,
                        with its valuable copper and z'nc mines, and the survey for the next section
                        is being vigorously pushed forward by Sir Charles Metcalfe, the engineer of
                        the line, and those working with him. The route which it is proposed that
                        this section shall take is from Broken Hill to tfie curious little
                        settlement of Bwone Macubwa, dose to the boundary line which divides
                        North-West Rhodesia from the Congo Free State. This settlement is said to
                        stand amid copper deposits of almost fabnlons extent and valne, while there
                        are also numerous caves of beautiful greeu malachite. These are of
                        surpassing loveliness, and have, of course, very considerable commercial
                        importance. At the present time there are only two or three adventurous
                        whites here, but when once the line is open to the sonth there is every
                        probability of a great mining rnsh taking place as soon as the resources of
                        »he district become generally realized. For the present all the effort to
                        the construction staff will be concentrated upon reaching Bwme Maoubwi as
                        quickly as possible, The usual rate of progress is about one miles a day,
                        though as much as 5 J miles of track have bseu laid in a single working day
                        of 12 hours. This achievement, by the way, is believed to be a world's
                        record,</p>
                    <p>There are very few engineering dilfioultiea to be dealt wi*h over this
                        portion of the route. The country through which the line will run is for the
                        most part a high tableland, with an average altitude of about 4,590 feet
                        above sea leve1, and broken up wi*h small valleys. The district is
                        p'entifally supplied with water for its whole extent, and the climate is
                        said to be ideal for E iropouiP. A bridge some 1,500 feet in length is
                        necessary to carry the line across the Kafne River, but after this the
                        country, frun an engiueer's point of view, is very eaRy. When this distriot
                        is opened op by means of the railway line it is likely to have a very
                        considerable effort upon the whole of Africa, in as much as it has a large
                        native population that is very willing to work either on the line or, it is
                        thought, in the mines of Rhodesia and the Rand.</p>
                    <p>While many people are content to jndge the tran8-Af>ic8n line solely on its
                        commercial possibilities, Mr. Beit was one of those who regarded it quite as
                        much for its importance ss a civilising influence, and certainly fin advent
                        of the line 1 as -completely altered the sitnatior, and altered it for the
                        better, in mary of the regions through which it has pasped. For one thing,
                        the iniquitoos slave trade ot the interior, so rampant only a few years ago,
                        is now almost entirely stamped ont.</p>
                    <p>So far as the line has gone it has thoroughly justified all the most
                        optimistic hopes of its founder. There were many to be feund both at<cb
                            n="3"/>home and in Sonth Africa who denonnoed the extension of the line
                        northwards from Bula wayo to the Viotoria Falls as the mad dream of a
                        visionary and one which could not possibly be jastifivi on commeroial
                        grounds. The resolt, however, has completely disproved these allegations.
                        Already the Wankie coalfield ranks among the most important of its kind in
                        Sonth Africa and the traffic from here is increasing every month. The
                        extension of the line into Northern Rhodeua, too, has led to the rapid
                        development of copper mining in this territory and precisely similar results
                        are to be looked for in the cate of the Broken Hill- Bwone Maoubwa 9eotion
                        as soon as it is open for traffic.</p>
                    <p>At the other end of Africa the Egyptian Government at the moment is
                        discussing the advisability of constructing another great dam across the
                        Nile at Rosaires, and should this be done the railway is certain to be
                        extended from Khartoum to the new works with a possible extension as far as
                        the Viotoria Nyarjia in order to form a junction with the Uganda II lilway.
                        When it is added that the distance, measured in a straight line from the
                        Viotoria Nyacza to Lake Tanganyika, is only six hundred miles, the
                        significance of this extension when considered in connection with the Cape-
                        to Cairo scheme as a whole is plainly to he recognized.</p>
                    <p>It is not too much to say not only that Mr. Beit's gift to the line has made
                        it oertain that it will, as has already been said, now be oarried through in
                        its entirety, bat it oan also be deolared that it has brought the date of
                        its completion forward by at least five years. No time is likely to be lost
                        in taking full advantage of the money which has so unexpectedly become
                        available, and the whole scheme now takes new life at the moment when, if it
                        was not exaotly languishing, it was at all events becoming a question
                        whether it wonld be wise to carry the line much farther than the houndary of
                        fhe CoDgo Free State. The only ipatter for regret is that neither of the two
                        paen to whoip the line is phiefiy due has lived long enough to witness its
                        consummation,</p>

                    <p>Salonioa is said to be richer than ary city of Greece in ecclesiastical
                        remains, and itsanpient stracture8, for the most part, have borne well the
                        ravages of time. There are many great edifices built by the Romans daring
                        their occupation $nd by the Greeks in their tippe stilh'n use—a minaret at
                        tfie corner of eaoh denotes the purpose tfiese one-time churches serve
                        to-day. There is a morque of St. Sophia at Salouica, built, like its great
                        sister at Constantinople, daring the reign of Justinian, and with a history
                        replete with bickerings between Orthodox aDd Catholic churcfies—until the
                        Turks made a mosque of it. Mosques are the most numerous places of worship
                        in Salonics, bat many mosques go to few Turks. In proportion as the mosques
                        ontnumber the synagogue0, the Jews outnumber the Turks. Tfiese Jews, like

                    <p>"Many ot the men cf Maoedonia wear a form of skirt. If one arrives at
                        Salonica iu the afternoon of a Jewish Sabbath his first impression is
                        invariably that he has landed among a raoe of bearded women. The quay is
                        thronged with promenading Jews in dressing gowns made of the most wonderful
                        designs in cotton prints. These gay figured garbs of many colours hang
                        straight from the shoulders to the heels, broktm only by a red sash, yards
                        in length, wound round and round the man till it forms a thick wad. Into
                        this, money, oigarette-boxes, beads, and other odds and ends are stuffed,
                        and in the oase of Turks, pistols and knives ; for this sash, which takes
                        the plaoe of pockets, is the one article of olothing which all the natives
                        have in commoD. The costume of the married women is most extraordinary an i
                        unbecoming. A green cap within a border of red, and a chin-strap of still
                        another colour, fits over the head and falls in a narrow bag behind to their
                        waists. Into this bag the hair is stuffed, for the same reason that in
                        Russia some seots of Israelites shave their heads. In ehirts the women also
                        go in for gaudy prints, and, like the men, wear, over a'l, fur lined
                        greatcoats.</p>

                    <p>FAR-REACHING DECISION- </p>
                    <p>The question whether a company registered abroad, but doing business from
                        London, is liable to pay income tax in London on the whole of its profits
                        wherever made paid to its shareholders, was raised yesterday week in the
                        House of Lords before the Lord Chancellor in the case of De Beers
                        Consolidated, Ltd., v. Howe (Surveyor of Taxes).</p>
                    <p>As the question is one that effects a large number of companies, the decision
                        of their Lordships is one that has been watched for with some anxiety in
                        City circles.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioners found that the trade or business of the appellants
                        constituted one trade or business, and was carried on at their London
                        office, whence the chief operations of the Company, both in the United
                        Kingdom and elsewhere, were managed, controlled, and directed, and tidy
                        accordingly held the whole of the profits liable to income tax.</p>
                    <p>The Court of Appeal affirmed that decision, and the Company appealed to their
                        Lordships.</p>
                    <p>The Lord Chancellor, in moving that the appeal should be dismissed, said that
                        under the schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1853, any person residing in the
                        United Kingdom must pay on his annual profits or gains arising or acoruing
                        to him "irom any kind of property whatever, wfiether sitnate in the United
                        Kingdom or elsewhere," and also from any profession, trade, employment, or
                        vocation, whether the same shall be respeotively carried on in the United
                        Kingdom or elsewhere. Ticino once generation,</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cohen, far the appellants, maintained that a company resided where it was
                        registered, and nowhere else. If that were so, the appellants must succeed,
                        for admittedly it was only registered in South Africa.</p>
                    <p>But his Lordship could no$ adopt Mr. Cohen's contention, lor in applying the
                        conception of residence to a company he thought they ought to proceed as
                        nearly as they could upon the analogy of ag individual. An individual flight
                        be of foreign nationality and yet reside in the United Kingdom. So might a
                        company. Otherwise it misfit have its chief seat of management and its seat
                        of trading in England under the protection of English law and yet escape
                        appropriate taxation by the simple expedient of being registered abroad, and
                        distributing its dividends abroad,</p>
                    <p>It was laid down more than thirty years ago that a company resided for the
                        purposes of its income tax where its real business was carried on. The
                        Commissioners had found that that placa was London.</p>
                    <p>it followed that this company was resident within the United Kingdom for the
                        purposes of income-tax, and most be assessed on that footing. He desired to
                        add that he agreed with the Master of the Rolls that the residence of a
                        company within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts was not necessarily the
                        same thing as residencies for the purpose of serving a writ.</p>
                    <p>Their Lordships agreed in this decision, and the appeal was accordingly
                        dismissed with costs.</p>

                    <p>In his latest statement as to cotton-spinning mill building in Lancashire,
                        Mr. William Tattersall says the boom is over, and at the present time no
                        projects for erecting factories are reported. Weaving shed extensions, he
                        states, are going on, but here also new places are coming to an end. The
                        009t to machinery and the equipping of a spinning mill is much higher than a
                        year or so ago, the estimated increase being, in a mill of 120,000 spindle,
                        about ££0,000. The heavier cost for yarn skips is a serious matter. It is
                        interesting to note that the automatic horn is making progress in various
                        districts.</p>
