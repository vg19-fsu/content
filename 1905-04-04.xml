                        </floatingText>East, though it is not yet over, has developed unrest in
                        Russia of a dangerous kind, and all the civilised world is watching the
                        direction which the danger may take with anticipations at once eager and
                        perplexed. There are so many conditions to the problem that it seems almost
                        insoluble by human intelligence, and yet on its solution the immediate
                        future will almost certainly depend. It is not only the future of Asia which
                        is at stake, but much of the future of Europe. We are not talking of the
                        "yellow peril," which may be real or imaginary, but of the changes within
                        Europe itself which any radical change in Russia would involve. A paralysis
                        of that great Empire which for more than a century has hung like a heavy
                        cloud on the Eastern frontiers of the really civilised 'section of the world
                        would, for example, leave Germany mistress of the Continent. It might
                        shatter the Austrian Empire to pieces, for her Slav majority would no longer
                        have to fear being "buried in the Russian morass." It would intensify in a
                        high degree the quarrel always smouldering between the Ottomans and the
                        remnant of their Christian subjects,-a result of which Europe already
                        perceives signs in the new arrogance which the Divan is displaying in the
                        Balkans. The Turkish Ministers have already appointed to high commands in
                        Macedonia officers whose one idea of order is to keep down recalcitrant
                        subjects by massacres so wide as to suggest an intention of extirpation.
                        French society would be shaken to its heart by a new liability to invasion,
                        and with it a fresh proclivity to panic. Even Great Britain, though still
                        encompassed by her inviolate sea, would feel the influence of the great
                        change, for India would be as safe from invasion as herself, and being safe,
                        would be apt to indulge in dreams of large ambition. It is not only natural,
                        therefore, but inevitable, that the world, though it is getting weary of the
                        war considered as a drama, should watch the course of events in Russia with
                        fascinated eagerness.</p>
                    <p>While, however, we perceive this clearly, we do not understand so well why so
                        many thoughtful men believe that the progress of the unrest will be fatal to
                        the autocracy, or why they are so possessed with the notion that if that
                        great cataclysm occurs, Russia will be weaker for its occurrence. As yet all
                        the symptoms point rather to a vast jacquerie than to what is commonly known
                        as a revolution. From province after province of Russia come up. stories
                        which show that the suspicion of the proprietary class so long smouldering
                        among the peasantry is breaking into flame; that château after château is
                        menaced, that in district after district the landlords are sending their
                        families, or flying themselves, for protection to the great cities. The
                        plunder to which the Reservists so often betake themselves is as much an
                        expression of hatred to the rich as of desire for a final revel, and is
                        accompanied in many instances by a destruction of property which can in no
                        way benefit the mutineers. The peasantry, it must be remembered, are
                        suffering severe economic distress, partly caused by increased taxation.
                        They cherish at heart the Asiatio idea that "whose is the sweat, his is the
                        soil"; they thought themselves cheated in the ultimate result of the
                        Emancipation decree; and they have some ground for believing that if they
                        rise, the Central Government would show itself on their side. It is admitted
                        by the great landlords themselves, who are promoting the movement of the
                        Zemstvos towards greater liberty, that one at least of their motives is
                        dread of an agrarian revolution as sanguinary as that of 1789-93 in<cb n="6"
                        />France. We do not imagine that the Government would actively aid that
                        revolution, though it must be remembered that whole classes of the smaller
                        proprietors were ruined at a stroke by the decree of Emancipation; but it is
                        not impossible they would passively watch a revolt that would then end in a
                        Russia composed of an absolute Tsar and millions of small freeholders. The
                        middle classes in Russia have no physical force with which to resist either
                        the Army or the peasants. There is no proof of their control over the
                        opinion of the masses, and a terrible and successful jacquerie is at least a
                        conceivable alternative to a political revolution. If Louis XVI. had been a
                        man with the great qualities of the earlier Bourbons, the French Revolution
                        also might have ended in that way. The Army hated the aristocratic caste
                        much more than it hated the Throne, and the emancipated peasantry would soon
                        have farnished the Monarch, as it has repeatedly done since that time, with
                        the force to hold down Paris. Besides, there is no Paris in Russia, no city
                        which by itself is capable of overturning a dynasty that has ruled and has
                        expanded Russia almost without a pause for nearly three hundred years.</p>
                    <p>But supposing that a real revolution breaks out-which is possible, of course,
                        as a result of weakness and indecision at the centre, and of the shock of
                        angry surprise with which Russians recognise the fact that their Government
                        can be beaten in war by a foe they had despis ed-where is the ground for
                        thinking, as a number of grave persons without doubt secretly think, that an
                        emancipated Russia would be either weak or unambitious 1 She might, on the
                        contrary, prove terribly strong. Russian Liberals obviously believe that the
                        newly enfranchised people would be jealous of their prestige even in the Far
                        East, and, many of them suggest that the war with Japan would be carried on
                        with a new energy it the people, were but enfranchised. Even if that were
                        not the case, owing to a certain horror of the "yel low devils" which has
                        sprung up among the Russian masses, Russia, boiling with excite ment with
                        all ambitious set free and her men of genius, of whom she has many, at last
                        relieved from the heavy weight above them- -at present they are like frogs
                        under a flagstone-might find in conquest the readiest outlet for her
                        energies, and by a grand war, say for Constantinople, might rouse to crusad
                        ing height the enthusiasm of her masses. Unless Russia actually broke up
                        into some form of federal State, which is hardly within the range of
                        political possibilities, any Government of Russia, whatever the name of the
                        dynasty, or whatever the form of its Constitution, must desire to reorganise
                        the Army, and to obtain something of that military prestige without which
                        armies are only collections of men in uniform. Men talk glibly enough of the
                        grand financial crash which might follow any revolution in Russia; but how
                        many millions were there in the treasury of the Terrorists, or of the
                        Directory which followed them, when they commenced the conquest of the
                        States around France, and when Napoleon, oppressed by the national poverty
                        as well as by his own ambition, declared his intention to "make war support
                        war," and to relieve rather than exhaust the nation: Exchequer by his
                        campaigns Even anar in Russia might not destroy her strength excel for a
                        short period. There is much in the Slav of the French nervous excitability;
                        much, also, of that craving for external repute which used to be the French
                        motive power. Nothing is certain yet, and political prophecy is often
                        political folly; but the able persons who fancy that the disorder in Russia
                        tends towards a millenium of peace and prosperity in Europe may be, as they
                        often have been before, be musing themselves with dreams.</p>

                        <p>Sir Reginald Wingate recently -sent home from Egypt a couple of young
                            giraffes, which travelled under the care of the celebrated Carl
                            Hagenbeck's best keepers. They are said to be the youngest giraffes ever
                            imported, and were fed, during the voyage, on condensed milk given in
                            enormous quantities. The giraffe is an exceedingly difficult animal to
                            import. Giraffes were first sent to the London Zoo in 1836, and from
                            them sprang the famous herd of giraffes for which the London Zoo was
                            famous, until the herd died out in 1881. </p>

                        extraordinary meeting of the General Assembly of the Legislative Council: </p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, - I am happy to see you assembled here. In your capacity of
                        representatives of the provinces you have exercised a satisfactory control
                        of the measures taken by our Government since your last meeting for the
                        prosperous progress of our country. Today I am highly pleased to address you
                        on certain : questions which have interested you on several occasions, such
                        as the extension of public instruction in Egypt and its propagation among
                        all classes. The Government has answered your demands as far as its
                        financial resources allowed, and thanks to its policy i and to the new
                        financial system, it has been able to increase the budget for public
                        instruction very considerably.. The Government will follow this course in
                        the future as far as its finances allow: In the course of the year the
                        Government has occupied itself with the question of public health and has
                        allowed the sums necessary for an extension of the labours of the Sanitary
                        Department, whose struggle against the cattle plague has brought about the
                        diminution of the epidemic, and has freed the country from the danger to an
                        extent beyond our expectations. Owing to the increase of transactions in
                        land the Government has been obliged to adopt a reform which was ardently
                        desired by the country, namely, the reduction of the stamp duties from 5 to
                        2 per cent. This reform has been met with universal gratitude and approval.
                        To sum up, our Government is -anxious to secure in every way the prosperity
                        of the country and to combat any evils that may afflict it. You are aware,
                        Gentlemen, that last April Egypt was threatened by an invasion of locusts
                        who attacked a large part of the country. The people were threatened, but
                        the Government took immediate and successful measures to combat the plague.
                        The cotton worm is the third plague which has attacked the country every
                        year. If it continues its terrible devastations it may inflict fatal injury
                        on the country's chief resource, the cotton crop. We must therefore join in
                        the struggle against this plague and take the exceptional measures which the
                        Government lays before you. You have been summoned to-day 'to examine its
                        proposals with a view to the protection of the country's chief asset. May
                        God enlighten and hearten you to work for the country's good." | To-day, at
                        9 a.m., the General Assembly met </p>
                    <p>to consider the projected decree relating to the measures to be taken against
                        the cotton worm. </p>

                        an exceptionally favorable arrangement with Mr. Pericles Glymenopoulo, who
                        not only has ceded to them a superficies of about 130,00Q pics of land at
                        Ramleh fronting the Khedivial Palace, at the very reasonable price of P.T.
                        15 per pic, but has also made the very generous offer to lend the committee
                        of the Victoria College &amp; sum of £15,000 for the space of three years at
                        5% interest in order to enable them to commence the work of building the new
                        college at once, which would not have been possible but for this offer, as
                        we understand that the committee were not in a position to commence the
                        building until such time as they had been | able to dispose of the land on
                        which the present</p>
                    <p>college stands. There is now no necessity for any hurry in disposing of same.

                    <head>ENGLISH EXPORTS TO EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The remarks we made in our issue of Friday | last in our analysis of
                        England's imports to Egypt, as disclosed by the returns of the Customs
                        Administration for the past year, are re-echoed in the following paragraph
                        from the "Review of Reviews" for March : </p>
                    <p>One of the most popular excuses for war is that it is necessary to cut
                        throats to secure markets. Apart from the morality or immor. ality of this
                        doctrine, our experience in Egypt seems to prove that although we spent
                        millions in securing a predominant position in the Valley of the Nile, it is
                        Germany, which never spent a penny or killed a man, that reaped the increase
                        of trade. Twenty years ago | 57.7 per cent. of the imports into Egypt came
                        from Great Britain, last year our proportion had fallen to 34 per cent.
                        Twenty years ago Germany only exported 0.4 per cent. of the total imports
                        into Egypt; last year she exported 4 per cent., a tenfold increase in twenty
                        years. We lost 3.7 per cent of the import trade; Germany gained 3.6.
                        Whatever else these figures prove, they do not exactly encourage the idea
                        that fighting for markets is a profitable investment of capital </p>

                    <p>Port Said, Sunday. On Friday afternoon, the centre of a cyclonic -storm
                        passed over 'Toussoum, a canal station south of Ismailia, destroying all
                        poles and wires in the district, so that both telegraphic and telephonic
                        communication were cut off between here and any point south of Diversoir,
                        and the banks of the canal were badly damaged in many places. At the same
                        time the steamer "Birkhall" went on shore in the Small Bitter Lake, and
                        owing to the Canal Company being unaware of the fact on account of all
                        communication being stopped, the confusion in the canal I became great. All
                        traffic was stopped at both ends by the "Birkhall," but ships were entering
                        the canal both from Port Said and Suez, and when communication, viâ
                        Alexandria, Cairo and Suez, was restored on Saturday morning at </p>
                    <p>half-past eleven it was found that there were | 22 ships south of the
                        "Birkhall" and 19 north </p>
                    <p>of her. | At 2 p.m. yesterday, by the aid of two </p>
                    <p>powerful tugs and a steam launch, the "Birkhall" was refloated and traffic
                        was resumed. The first ship reached Port Said at 9.50 this morning, after
                        having been tied up for nearly 24 hours. </p>
                    <p>The Eastern Telegraph Suez Canal wires were temporarily repaired at 6 a.m.
                        to-day and direct communication was restored. </p>

                    <p>DOCTOR'S CLAIM AGAINST THE PALMERSTON |INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCE CORPORATION. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich, in the Chancery Division on March 27, commenced the
                        hearing of an action by Dr. Robert William Felkin against the Palmerston
                        Industrial and Finance Corporation, Ltd., and Mr. Alfred Bridge, of 15,
                        Cockspar-street, S.W., claiming rescission of an agreement to take 800
                        shares in the SudanExploration, Ltd., and a declaration that defendants were
                        liable to indemnify plaintiff in respect to all expenses incurred by him in
                        relation to the trasaction. In the alternative, plaintiff asked for damages
                        for misrepresentation.—Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K.C., and Mr. J.H. Simmons
                        appeared for the plaintiff ; Mr. Ashton Cross for the Palmerston Corporation
                        ; and Mr. W.J.L. Ambrose for Mr. Bridge. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Lawrence said Dr. Felkin had spent some time in Egypt, and knew the Sudan
                        well. When he returned to England, unfortanately for himself, he got mixed
                        up with the defendant Bridge, who was a company promoter. He was first
                        attracted to Bridge by an advertisement in a London paper for a gentleman to
                        act as director of a public company, and willing | to subscribe £1,000.
                        Bridge's exact relationship to the Palmerston Corporation counsel said he
                        did not know; but he appeared to have drawn cheques in the name of the
                        corporation and in | the name of the directors, Generally he appeared to be
                        the company himself. Bridge first got Dr. Felkin interested in the
                        Palmerston Corporation, and then, finding that the plaintiff know a great
                        deal about Sudan cotton-planting and transport, he brought to his notice the
                        Sudan Exploration Company. Bridge told plaintiff that if he would take 800
                        £1 shares | he should have them for £1,000, and that he would accept, on
                        behalf of the Palmerston Corporation, a bill accepted by Dr. Felkin at three
                        months. Bridge also said that he would be able to sell for plaintiff enough
                        of the shares which he controlled, so as to give I plaintiff cash to pay for
                        them -- that was to </p>
                    <p>say, that they were shares which would go up | on the market. Plaintiff was
                        to retain the | balance of the shares left. Counsel said he thought he would
                        be able to show that the corporation did not control the shares. Subse|
                        quently Dr. Felkin attended at Bridge's, office, and accepted a bill drawn
                        by Bridge. The bill was endorsed by Dr. Bryant: The bill found its way into
                        the hands of a moneylender named Levene, having been discounted by Bridge,
                        who received a cheque for £800. Plaintiff had not been able to ascertain
                        what became | of the £800, and whether it went into the Palmerston Company's
                        coffers, or into Bridge's hands. When the bill matured Bridge gave the money
                        lenders two other bills, the premium for renewal being £125. Plaintiff went
                        to Bridge's office and accepted the bills, which were again endorsed by Dr.
                        Bryant. The | plaintiff was unable to find the money to meet </p>
                    <p>the bills, and there was no sale of the shares, which plaintiff believed were
                        never in the possession or under the control of the Palmerston Corporation
                        at all. The money lender brought an action against the drawer, the endorser
                        and the acceptor of the bills, and judgment was obtained against both drawer
                        and endorser. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Ambrose, interposing, said that judgment was against Bridge, but not by
                        consent. </p>
                    <p>Proceeding, Mr. Lawrence said plaintiff settled the action by paying the
                        money lender, as he was advised that whatever remedy he bad was in the
                        present action. Counsel contended that plaintiff never had any
                        consideration, and that he never saw the shares, and he did not believe that
                        the defendant corporation ever controlled them. He believed that the £800
                        was got out of him by Bridge for his own person. al benefit. The corporation
                        had put in &amp; defence stating that it was always willing and ready to
                        hand over the shares to the plaintiff, | and it denied that the policy and
                        business of </p>
                    <p>the corporation were controlled by Bridge, nor | did it admit that such
                        representations were made by Bridge as alleged by the plaintiffs, The
                        defendant Bridge had pleaded that if he did make any statement or
                        representations concerning the present or fature value of the shares in the
                        Sudan Exploration Company, they were bona fide expressions of opinion. </p>

                        chefd'oeuvre de J. Richepin, "Cadet Roussel". </p>
                    <p>Le sujet est d'une fraicheur naïve, semé de notes gaies et drôles qui
                        produisent le meilleur effet. | M. Coquelin Cadet a été comme d'ordinaire
                        remarquable dans le rôle de Cadet Roussel, Mlla Moreno très gracieuse, dans
                        celui de Delvaporine et Mlle Maufroy tout à fait bien dans le personnage
                        tendre de Mariette. Les autres acteurs se sont également distingués, M. Mon.
                        teux dans le rôle de Roussel ainé, Mme Bouchetal dans celui de La Maillard,
                        etc: </p>
                    <p>La scène de Démocrite, jouée par Mile | Moreno et M. Jean Coquelin a obtenu
                        un très vif succès de gaieté. La soirée a pris fin avec quelques monologues
                        dits par M. Coquelin Cadet avec le brio qu'on lui connait et qui n'a pas été
                        l'un des moindres charmes de sa tournée. De nombreuses corbeilles de fleurs
                        ont été offertes aux principaux acteurs et actrices par leurs admirateurs.
                        Ajoutons que jamais hommage ne fut plus mérité. </p>
                    <p>En nous quittant la Compagnie Coquelin Cadet laisse ici le meilleur souvenir.

                    <p>This Company is formed for the purpose of carrying on the business ot an
                        Investment,Exploration^! Development Company, especially in Egypt and the
                        8oudan. ^ For some years private Syndicates have been exploring conoesffons
                        granted by the Egyptian and Soudan Governments with tery satisfactory
                        results; districts previously unexplored have been opened up, and laud
                        hitherto of little value is now steadily improving in price, and is in great
                        demand. The irrigation and reclamation schemes projected are likely to still
                        farther increase the investment demand for laud In view of the above, it ia
                        proposed that this Company shall pay epeoial attention to business connected
                        with land development irrigation schemes, and reclamation works. It is
                        generally admitted that the many industries of Egypt, unler the careful
                        supervision of the Government, are now malting stead, progress. It is -
                        intended to act as financialagents in JJoodoi^ Fans and elsewhere for laud
                        development, mining and other companies, and i. is anticipated that
                        considerable profit will result from this source. In view of the increasing
                        interest of Freooh Investors in Bgyptian Securities, it is proposed to open
                        a Branch Offise ia Paris at a.: early date. As the success of Company of
                        this nature is to a large extent dependent upon a thorough knowledge of
                        looal conditions, it is extrem ely satisfactory to have secured the
                        servioes, as Director and Agent-General in Egypt, of Mr. Hooker, late
                        Geueral Manager of the Bgyptian Salt and Soda Company, formerly
                        Direotor-Ueneral of the Egyptian Government Salt Department in Egypt ;his
                        knowledge of the conatry and local business conditions is probably
                        unequalled. Mr. Hooker has consented to act for a period of three years, at
                        a salary of £1,000 per anuum, with a farther remuneration equal to 5 per
                        cent, of the net profits in eaoh year available for distribution among the
                        shareholders ^whether distributed or not) in excess of an amount equal to
                        £10 per cent, on the capital paid up on the Sharee of the Company for the
                        time being issued. 100,000 shares forming part of the present issue have

                    <p>It has been truly said that " Nothing goes right while the stomach is '
                        wrong." 5 It is therefore important in treating lung troubles to keep the
                        digestive organs in a healthy condition. That is just what Angler's Emulsion
                        does; it promoted appetite, aids diges- tion and improves nutrition, while
                        at the same time it soothes and heals the lungs and air passages. It is this
                        combined effect upon the respiratory and digestive'organs that makes it
                        superior to any other remedy for lung affections and wasting diseases.</p>

                    <p>The Mesopotamia treated in this report is the true delta of the rivers
                        Euphrates and Tigris, and comprises the country traversed by the two rivers
                        and thieir branches southwards of Hit on the Euphrates and Beled near the
                        site of the ancient Opis on.the Tigris. From Hit to Gama, past the ancient
                        Babylon, is the Euphrates. The Hindia Canal is the branch which leaves the
                        Euphrates hear Mosaib and joins it again at Sawama, after flowing through
                        -the Sea of Nejef. From Beled to Gama, past Bagdad and Am.ara, is the
                        Tigris. The Hai Canal leaves the Tigris at Root and flows into, the
                        Euphrates near Sheikh es Shayak. During the Khalifate this canal was the
                        main channel of the Tigris. From Gurna,' the junction of the two rivers, to
                        Fao on the Persian Gulf, the joint stream is called the Basra River. By the
                        Arabs it is known as the Shaat el Arab, or the River of the Arabs. in. THE
                        EUPHRATES. The Euphrates enters its delta at Hit, where there are excellent
                        limestone quarries and bitumen springs. From Hit to the Persian Gulf, on a
                        length of some 930 kilometres, the river rolls its yellow water through an
                        open, plain, bounded on the west by the desert. Uu the east pr left bank,
                        islands of the gravelly desert are met with south of Feluja and again near
                        Mosaib. - , Ffom Hit to Feluja, on a length of about 130 kilometres, the
                        river is broad,, varying m width from 250 to 450 metres, the current is
                        about 3 kilometres an hour, and the average . depth 3.50 mptres. The valley
                        is narrow, liable to overflow in places in high floods, and irriga- tion is
                        in great part carried on by "charads" where water is raised in bullock skms
                        by means of a rope passed over' a pulley ami drawn up by mules or horses
                        going down and up an incline. . From Feluja to Mosaib, a distance of some 90
                        kilometres, the average width of the river is 250 metres. The trough of the
                        Euphrates is some 3 metres deep down to the level ot low supply, and a flood
                        of 3.50 metres puts the country under half a metre of water, against which
                        it is protected by dykes, which are not very effective, and are occasionally
                        burst, causing serious inundations. The following table of mean heights of
                        the Euphrates at Mosaib will give a good idea of the times of flood and low
                        supply of the river. The figures are very approximati ve but they represent
                        the best information obtained by me.</p>

                    <p>The following articles translated from "Al Chark" give a fair, idea of one
                        side of native opinion in reference to the A1 Azhar crisis : — "We refrained
                        from reproducing the rumours published by our contemporaries in Cairo with
                        regard to A1 Azhar until the storm had passed and the agitation was brought,
                        to silence, and until our colleagues had saved themselves the trouble of
                        disoussions and explanations. Now that tranquillity has beeu restored and
                        the weather has resumed its former calmness, and the reser- vists of A1
                        Azhar have been allowed a free hand,- we may asktba reformers these
                        questions: What will A1 Azhar become hereafter 1 and what will be the
                        condition of its graduates once they have acquired the religious sciences
                        taught in it ? Will it be more than a religious college wherein nothing but
                        the Mohamedau law is taught, and the sheikhs, on being graduated, will they
                        be acquainted with anythihg else besides religious questions ? Where will
                        this great army get their daily bread once they have left A1 Azhar and
                        become Ulema in reli- gion and' Imams of the believers I There is no

                        marry and increase in number, and this involves energy and skill to obtain
                        the necessary means of sustenance'. Bat how can such persons take part in
                        the dreadful battle of life unprepared for it and devoid of any social
                        knowledge 1 Will the Hakkanieh (Ministry of Justice) find sufficient
                        employment for all of them as jndges, bashkatibs, and muftis 1 This question
                        deserves much medita- tion. The Grand Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Mo hamed Abdou,
                        as well as Sheikh Abdilkarim Silmajo, have both resigued their poits in the
                        Council of Administration at Al Azhar owing to the objection of the majority
                        of the sheikhs there to include any worldly (modern) science in the
                        curriculum and insisting on confining themselves to religious studies
                        exclusively." "In our issue of yesterday we expressed an opinion regarding
                        A1 Azhar and said we won- dered whether thfese Ulema, with no experience of
                        anything except religious matters, would be able to earn their living. A
                        Moslem friend has just sent us the following communication in response to
                        our questions : You have asked an important question with freedom aud
                        courage at a time when other papers have passed over the terrible weakness
                        in the re- gulations of the greatest Mohamedan uni- versity. Endless
                        discussions are now going on in this connection, and a great number of our
                        .earned sheikhs are complimenting each other on their escape from tne board
                        of examinations, and are thanking God that they will no more become
                        mathematicians, geographers, natural- ists, or chemists. This greatest ot
                        universities contains ten thousand students ; each one ot them is strong
                        enough to remove a mountain ; Alexander, Haunibal, and Bonaparte, who
                        covered the world' with fire and blood, had not stouter bodies nor stronger
                        arms ; neither were ihe students at Paris greater in number when in 1892 a
                        prime minister apologised to them and excused himself. I had occasion to see
                        a party of students at A1 Azhar whom I supposed to be moving rocks and
                        speaking mountains. I noticed one of them had a dispute with another on a
                        certain matter of opinion, and a nig fight ensned : boxing, and biting were
                        indulged in freely, and the earth trembleu with cries. On another occasion I
                        heard some sheikhs speaking there ; so sweet were, their words, so plehsaut
                        tneir conversation, so clear tlieir: minds, and so excellent their- charac-
                        tera«-as to surpass all expectations. I heard one of them discuss a
                        religious i .question with such competence and modesty and con- vincing
                        proofs as I have , never before seen or heard. This numerous army of human
                        oeings should be the source of Arabic literature and the most reliable body
                        on both worldly and religious science. It should be the equip- ments and
                        weapons to Islamism, its peace,and its war. This force should be converted
                        into virtnonsness ; this youthliilness into righteous- ness ; this
                        intelligence and ability into fortresses and fortifications. A1 Azhar should
                        be the centre of all hopes, and the object of the greatest care and
                        attention. If.it become ill it should be doctored, and if it become crooked
                        it should be put straight. But if all means have failed and there is no hope
                        of recovery it is then right that it? should be thrown down stone by stone
                        and demolished to the ground. "Have you ever seen a young sheikh in hi»
                        first year at Al Azhar 1 It he preached in > village abd said to the
                        inhabitants, ' God com- mands you not to sell your cotton,' do you i-hink
                        any one of them would dare to sell one pound of cotton 1 And if he were to
                        say that Ghina was a town at a short distance from Ghirgeh, and that it was
                        rushing upon them to deprive them of their properties; would there be any
                        one without a naboot, a rifle, or an axe, and would you hear anything but
                        screams and cries 1 If plagiie, cholera, or fever prevailed in an epidemic

                        nistration find any one to hearken to its idvice or follow its precautions ?
                        Such is tb> fluence of these sheikhs upon the puhlii uinda that it is
                        absolutely necessary that they should he intelligent and well-instructed. Al
                        Azhar contains two distinct parties : the one composed of those who go. to
                        study and learn, and the other of those who consider Al Azhai asylum ora
                        place of retuge for those wli'i scape from military service or are tire' >f
                        judicial supervision, or are sick of thi world and its disappointments. The
                        former ac in accordance with the ' Holy Hadith ' : Seel knowledge though in
                        China ; the latter atten- i t Al .Azhar not with the intention to study but
                        merely on woount of itn being a ' Tikia ' wherein the greatest desire is to
                        be left quiet in their beds, and be served with their daily food regularly.
                        "This is the real cause of what is at present called disorder and trouble at
                        Al Azhar, and which in reality is but a noble struggle for the better. Now
                        that the reformers have relin- quished their posts iu the administration of
                        that uuiversity, and that the reactionary party has gained a complete
                        victory over the pro- gressive party, the only answer to yonr ques- tion is
                        that the numerous body of students have completely detached themselves from
                        public society so that they do not understand the public nor do the public
                        understand them; they aot in a way which the public will not fol- low. When
                        this great army finds itself without -work and without sustenance, it will
                        spread itself among the people and infect their minds with every species of
                        ignorance. It will ingra- tiate itself amoDg'the public by means of mi-
                        racles and wonders, and will exert influence on their admirers with canning
                        sorcery and magio to deprive them even of their clothingi The country will
                        encounter enormous difficulties through this army. No cultivation will be
                        com- pleted, no cotton will be sold, no precautions will be taken against
                        epidemic diseases, no modem project of the oivilised world will be
                        considered until the learned adviser has been consulted. It will not be
                        unusual tosee acommonmanarguing firmly that the sun sets in the sea, and
                        that there is a special moon for each month, and that no man should seek his
                        bread but that the bread follows the man wherever he goes, and so on. I pray
                        the gracious God that He may not reduce Al Azhar to such a state, and that
                        that institution may be restored to its ancient position in the Moslem
                        world, and that its members may become a strong army of pro- gress and
                        usefulness.</p>
