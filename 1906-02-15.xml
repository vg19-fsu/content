                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                        <p>The weather in the early part of yesterday was bright and cheerful, but
                            as the day advanced ominous clouds gathered and the atmosphere became
                            strongly charged with electricity. There was considerable loghtning and
                            thunder about 9 p.m., and this was followed by a moderate gale from the
                            W. The morning opens cool, cloudy, and dull, with squalls from the W.
                            and a falling barometer.</p>

                    <head> MOROCCO CONFERENCE. </head>
                    <p>It is almost a traiem to say that the solemn conolavə which is being held at
                        Algeciras involves interests far wider than those of a semi-barbarian people
                        in the north west corner of Africa. Roughly speaking, the Conference will
                        decide whether the nations of Europe are determined to live in peace with
                        out another or whether they are still a lot of squabbling children, ready to
                        take offence at the first word spoken in a moment of anger. The responsible
                        men of the countries most interested have openly declared that they wait
                        nothing so much as peace. Bat the crucial question is now being discussed by
                        the delegates, and by their fraita we shall know tham. Germany has
                        deliberately thrust the policing question into the forefront of the
                        controversy.. It she had contouted herself with her woonomio / claims her
                        positioa would have been onassail able. By the Madrid Treaty of 1880 she is
                        entitled to equal commercial treatment and the open door. Rugland, for bør
                        own purpo:es, limited her demands for equal treatment to a period of thirty
                        years. But she could not, of course, bind Germany by any private arrangement
                        made' between herselt. and France ; therefore Germany was perfeotly
                        justified in taking steps to make it known that there was to be no
                        limitation of time as far as she was concerned ; she stood abaqlately by the
                        Mad. 'rid Treaty, and claimed her tall rights. The point was perhaps an
                        insignificant one, not worth all the fass that has been made about it, since
                        France always declared her intention of preserving the open door, and there
                        woald have been ample time for Germany to ory oat when she was actually
                        chreatened. Still she had a right to make her voice heard at any time if
                        she'thought her interests were in any danger; and no one would object to her
                        endeavour to make her own position quite clear. | Unfortunately, shedragged
                        politios into what was really an economio question. She . believed, or
                        professed to believe, that the Rronoh were aiming at a sort of protectorate
                        over Morocco, "and that, while nominally adhering to the prinsiple of the
                        open door at the porta, they would opposo German enterprise in each matters
                        as financial and railway exploitation. Booba polioy would, she contended, be
                        contrary to the spirit of the Madrid Treaty. In order to prevent the
                        realisation of such a protectorato Germany is det soined that the seounty of
                        life and property in Morocco must be guaranteed by some sort of interna
                        cional control, and not by Pradoe alone. l'he proposal she is believed to
                        have in view is one which will hand over the policing of Morocco to some
                        disinterested Power who will be the mandatory of all the civilised nations,
                        She will leave to France the task of polioing tbo Algerian frontier – that
                        was conoeded from the first in the negotiations which led to the acceptance
                        of the Conference ; and Spain will be allowed a similar privilege in the
                        parts of Morocco adjoining her territory ; but the rest of the country must
                        be placed either ander an international commission, or else | under the
                        control of one neatral and disin terested Power. And it is understood that
                        Germany would prefer the latter alternative. | There are several objections
                        to the German soheme. First of all it would be difficolt to Johoose the
                        nentral Power. Even if a nation like Denmark or Switzerland were willing to
                        andertake the task, the necessary anthority: would be lacking. On the -other
                        hand, if Italy or Austria were soggusted, France would certainly feel
                        affronted, Italy is a Mediterranean Power like Franoe. Why should sbe be
                        asked. to step into Morocco and perform a task whicb, it is alleged, cannot
                        be undertaken by France withont injary to the interests of Earope! . Indeed,
                        it is diffioult to see how any Power, bowever disinterested in theory, can
                        besked to dearp the position which France had mark | d out for herself. To
                        accept such a mandato would be to ooort the enmity of the French p:ople, and
                        that in itself would surely debar Italy from stepping into the broach. The
                        ides of an international commission is rstbor less open to objeotion, but
                        the experienco. of interTuational commisione in hardly encouraging </p>

                        <p>This morning, the appeal of Mr. Luigi Stagni against the decision given
                            in regard to the Custom House Porters Benevolent society came before the
                            Mixed Appeal Court. Mr. Stagni had made a contract with the Society
                            whereby at should undertake the "factage" of his wood stores. But the
                            work did not give satisfaction and some correspondence ensued. The
                            matter came before a judge in chambers, who ordered an expert to give
                            his opinion. M. Mazou was selected. The appeal was against the
                            nomination of this expert on the ground that he was only a nautical
                            expert. Mr. Stagvi demanded that a specially qualified man should be
                            chosen, or if M. Muzou remained he should be assisted in bis
                            investigations by two other qualified men. </p>

                        <p>New York reports that the Wifabeaters' Whipping Bill, a measure supported
                            by the President of the United Stat98, has been rejected by 153 to 57
                            votes. It was killed with ridicule. One representative declared that
                            there were more women who felt pain because they were not married than
                            because they were beaten. He suggested pillorying bachelors over twenty
                            years of age. </p>

                        owing to the unjastifiable increase in the lui tax on 'dnnumbered carriages,
                        which, as of your readers are aware, has been raised from P.T. 50 to P.T.
                        150 per annum. It is abgnrd to consider that this tax will only apply to the
                        177 birds carriages. It will equally apply to over 1,000 private carriages.
                        Is it to be expected that the owners of these carriages are more likely to
                        remain quiet under this imposi tion than are the owners of the semi-public

                        have been obliged to give in for fear of starvas etion, the difficulty will
                        not be in any way shelvad, for it then may be takea pp by a much more

                    <p>The following anthorised statement in regard to the presence of a Belgian
                        post on the Upper Nile has been issued :-It is an ondoghted fact that
                        Congolese native soldiers anpeared at Inyolo in 1904, and that a "mirsion"
                        of some kind, ostensibly &amp; scientific one, has been in oooupation of the
                        post ever since. The Egyptian Government did not welcome this prolonged
                        stay, especially as the mission and the patives failed to agree. As a
                        pacifio mode of app sing pressure upon the visitors to "move on," it was
                        decided some three months ago to stóp the Belgian transport and post
                        servizos on the Nile, bat, up to the present, the Congolese mission has
                        apparently been able to get sufficient supplies from its Congo base to
                        withstand the inconvenience thug involved. The British and Egyptian
                        Governments are on good terms with the Belgian Government, and there seems
                        to be every hope that the mission will shortly be withdrawn from territory
                        within the sphere of British and Egyptian jarisdiction without the recessity
                        arising for resort to stronger measures than those already in operation.

                    <p>We understand the Menzaleh. Capal and Navigation Co. intend commencing a
                        servic9 € between Matari-h and Port-Ssid (Karponty) in 8 a few days. The
                        service most at first be more or less experimental until the "raises" get
                        accostomed to the bindling of the steamers e onder somewhat new nditions,
                        and antil it be ascertained hy experjance what time will be occupied by the
                        journey between the two towns. The difficulty at present appears to be for
                        the steamers to attain the estimated speed in! | shallow water. This,
                        however, in no way affects the ultimate succers of the service, for the
                        actual cost of dredging is comparatively small, and it would well repay the
                        company to deepen the canal, if by doing so it were found that b the speed
                        of the steamers could be increased t to that estimated. It is expeoted that
                        very shortly a regular time-table will ba published, a and quick trains
                        between Matsrieh" and i Vansourah will run in connection with the company's
                        service across the lake. The 'a steamers will probably leave Port-Said duily
                        at 1 8 a.m. and it is hoped that passengers will catch the 11.30 train from
                        Matarieh to Man. sonrah.. The disadvantage of Karpoaty as a point of
                        departure will soon be done away with, for within three month, the company
                        experts to I have completed the canal ap to Raqwa, where f a large quay is
                        now poder construction. When this work is finished the passenger steamers
                        will leave for Matarieh from Raswa. We understand the company is negotiating
                        with the Government for acting as salesmen for the fish basiness on the
                        lake, with a view to protecting the interests of the fishermen, who are now
                        completely in the bands of groups of local sheikhs. Parchases of building
                        sites at Matarieh have also been made recently which should yield a good
                        profit. The opening of the Ananieh Canal for navi. gation, insaring a free
                        waterway from PortSaid to Mangourah and even Cairo, is now it ander study.
                        Ao ording to the company's concession, this I portion of the work must be
                        commenced before January 1, 1907, and finished by Jaquary, 1909. Wêre it not

                        that his wife Mar. Tgaret had been guilty of misconduct with a man unknown.
                        The wife, in reply, alleged connivance and oraelty. | The petitioner, who
                        appeared refore the late Lord St. Helier in 1904, said that he married the
                        respondent at, he British Conga. late in Alexandria in 1899. They lived in
                        Cairo till August, 1903, and then went to ] Eogland, as he hoped to induce
                        her to be more economical when free from the society whe mixtd with in
                        Egypt. He returned to Euýpt in the following Ootober, bat in consequence of
                        a letter received from his father in September he went back to England to
                        institrte divorce proceedings. Threo woeks after he had landed his wife gave
                        birth to a child. Mr. H. Murphy : Have you ever atrack your wife 1-Once.
                        Uoder what circumstances ? - I made a cabinet for a map, and later asked him
                        for payment. He said he had already paid, and showed me a receipt in my
                        wite's hand-writing. On toxing her wth it, she denied her writing, and in a
                        temper I struck her. That was the only time. Cro-s-examined by Mr. Drake,
                        the witne=8 said he first met his wife in Cairo when be w48 19. He denied
                        that be brought her to Bogland w th the object of getting rid of her. The
                        bills du, to his wite's extravagance "came in like clouds," and when he got
                        back to Cairo be wrote "in a passion" that her "last card was played," and
                        that he would never let her join him again. In reply she wrote : "My dear,
                        dear husband, - I thought my poor heart was being torn ont. Do not judge me
                        too harshly, Ted, as I have been good to you and the little On88, only the
                        accursed management of money was my only fault, as you know yourself. Try
                        your best, darling, and forgive me with a good | heart, as I have turned
                        over a new leaf already, and am a far different girl than what you left
                        bebind in this miserable place." The petitioner said he would have taken bis
                        | wife back if his parents had informed him that | she bad improved. The
                        respondent, in her evidence, said that until she came to England they got on
                        "pretty reasonable." ( ca ber husband kioked ber, and said that if he had a
                        revolver he would have shot her. It was throagh him that she commenced to

                    <p>Some fifteen years ago Mesars. Th. Ralli and P. Philippoteaux conosived the
                        idea of starting a small Art Bxbibition in Cairo ; to day the Exposition
                        Internationale des Beans Arts has become one of the features of the BOASon,
                        and numbers among ita patrons ench world-famed artists 24 Messrs. L. Bondat,

                        . 1 There are many important canvagas in the present exhibition-notably ONA
                        very larga one (No. 243) Le Bain dos Nymphes, hy Alfred Planzean, which was
                        in the Salon last year. The composition and coloaring of this vy of bathing
                        nymphs startled at the appearance of the satyr, are admirable, the cool
                        atratch of water and the green forn-oled banke making &amp; delightfal
                        scheme of colour. In close prox. I. imity is the life-like portrait of Mme
                        G., by Victor Grétin, a beautifal piece of work repre.. senting the lady in
                        black dress and hat and light overcoat standing in front of a doll gold
                        ourtain. Lovers of London atmosphere will experience &amp; certain amount of
                        heimweh on finding at the end of the large room a painting of the La Tamise
                        (No 17) below London Bridge with the dome of St. Paul's looming through the
                        mist, and the foreground filled with the berges and usual river boats. The
                        artist, A. Barbier, has caught the atmosphere and mystery in whioh our river
                        loves to enfold itself, and one can almost fael the drear gloom of the day
                        as one looks apon its misty half shades. Arthomics (No. 18), hy | Alexis
                        Axilete, is a happy inspiration, The young buntress aglow in the early
                        morning sonlight, and with the young pale moʻn abnye bør bead, is poised
                        with bow ontstretobed, the honnds beld in leash behind her. Mlle. Lonise
                        Abbema is represented by a delightfal bead of a fair young girl in vignette
                        surrounded by branches of wi-teris and a big sheaf of pennies: a delicate
                        piece of work, and very much more to be desired than some of the other
                        soulless studies of feminine baanties. There is not mnoh depth of feeling in
                        Dimanche (No. 5) by Mlle George Achille-Poold thongh the young couple appear
                        to be enjoying themselves, and the details and portraits have been worked up
                        to a wonderfal degree of finish. For mastery of composition, drawing, and
                        minnte detail one must visit Didte complote (No. 67). by Francesco Branery,
                        whose canvas will bear the most minute inspection and which is admirable in
                        every respect. His Tóte de femmo (No. 68). in pastel, ig also charmingly
                        rendered. Un cas Embarassant (No. 124), by Mlles Cecile and Mario Deslions,
                        attracts many admirers. It represents a faithfal but perplexer waiting maid
                        disolosing the tattered condition of his garments to the equally perplexed
                        caré, and the f4088 and treatment of both figates are most happily rendered.
                        Soleil d'Au. tomne (No.6), by L. B. Adan, with ite! resting figare gazing
                        from its corner, framed: | by bright green ivy on to the leaflegg woods
                        beyond, is an excellent piene of work; Veillo Ravandeuse (No. 9). by Sem
                        Angerville, is a deli htful study of an old dame smiling over ber work
                        before her cottage window. Albert Guillaume has three canvase* (Non. 145
                        147). Two of these, Ferveur and Gestation, are his gorious wierd grote quer,
                        Esthetismo haa not mnoh interest. Au Large (No. 256), by Lonis Ridel, b-8
                        made &amp; name but does not appeal to the ordinary eye. The two frail
                        ladies, oled in diaphanong decolleté gowns and bats, stretched apon the deck
                        of a boat amid heaving waves, is in no way convincing, though may be its
                        treatment is high above the average. Espagnolo (No. 180), by Mme Julette
                        Dubufe Webrie, is fine in colouring with its copper coloured draperies
                        against the gold background, bat the features are not distinotly Spanish in
                        type and are faulty in modelling. Miss Elizabeth Noorse has some delightful
                        studies, of child life in Les Enfants de Penmarch and Fráre ot Sæur
                        Bigoudins (Nos. 233 and 234); Un Champ do Bataille (No. 194). by Timotéon
                        Lobrichon, will doubtless appeal to the domesticated mother and lover of
                        children. Napoleon on board the Bellerophen in Plymooth Sound, is the
                        gobject of Jales Girardet's cativas No. 140 m.; it PORFASAGs fome merit

                    <p>Reports of a very satisfactory character as to the progress that is being
                        made in the establishment of a cotton-growing industry in the territory of
                        the Mozambique Company have been received from the Governor. The industry is
                        still in its youth, and experiments are being made, both by the local
                        administration and by private growers, to determine what are the most
                        suitable kinds of cotton to grow commercially. At the Government
                        experimental gardens at Chimoio satisfactory results have been obtained from
                        various Ezyptian varieties, and this year several American varieties,
                        including Georgia, Sea Island, and Louisiana, are being planted for
                        experimental purposes. Bat already experiments have been made on &amp;
                        commercial scale, with the result that last year some 59 tons of cotton were
                        prodace 1, | about 18 tons - by the Mozambique Company and the balance on
                        various private plantations. This year &amp; very much larger area has been
                        cleared and planted with both American and Egyptian varieties, and it is
                        estimated that, on a very conservative computation, the crop for the year
                        should be not much short of 300 tong. Several of the consignments which have
                        reached Liverpool have been reported on favourably, and have bronght good
                        prices. Both as regards climate and soil, the Mozambique Company's territory
                        is exceptionally well adapted for cotton cultivation. It is stated that
                        there are, close to the cast, and consequently with cheap sea transport,
                        many handreds of equare miles of cotton land, while, it is said; it has also
                        been proved that along the line of the Beira Railway there are large areas
                        where the yield of cotton per acre is very greatly in excess of the average
                        yield in the Southern States of America.</p>

                        to read the book Sar until quite lately, when I spent many a pleasant hour
                        enjoying it. Other books have appeared on the songs of the Egyptians, such
                        As Bonriant's "Chansons Arabes Popnlaires," | Mo bat Profesor Scha-ffer's
                        book desls, not with 'Sat the songs of Cairo bat with those of the peasants
                        of Upper Egypt, living so far from the metropolis. Uolike Monsieur
                        Boariant's book, where the songs are entirely in Arabic, with not. a word in
                        French to say what they mean, the author gives the songs in Latin characters
                        and the translation line by line, Fel in some places word for word. There is
                        no doubt that these songs are really song by the natives in that part of the
                        country ; | they are, therefore, genuino Bong8 as any Egyptian who hails
                        from the Said will at Once find out and will probably remember many of them.
                        Like all songs in colloquial Arabic, they are not set to metre, as Arabic
                        poetry must of neceşsity be, but they have their melodies to Egyptian ears,
                        and I may venture Fri to say they are not diapleasing to Earopean ears when
                        properly read. Not koowing German, I could only judge the book in its
                        English garb, and having carefally compared the original Arabio of many of
                        the songs with their English translation, I have no hesitation in saying
                        that Mrs. Breasted 'has done her work in a very creditable manner and is
                        therefore to be congratulated on its succes. It is most difficult to make a
                        literal comprehensible translation from one language to another, especially
                        poetry or songs, as all who have tried it have found ont, 18 and I am sure
                        few of Mrs. Broasted's English readers will find it difficult to anderstand
                        her renderings, aspecially with the head and foot potes necessary to perf
                        sc'ly compre- M hend not the meaning of the words themselves ibat the idea
                        they are mgant to convey. I only wish Mrs Breasted bas improved more on the
                        German edition by giving the Arabic text in its own characters so that the
                        book would have formed an incomparable collection of exercises, containing
                        sentences and expressions of the purely fellaheen language not to be met
                        with elsewhere. The illustrations of peasant life, all of which are
                        excellent, add to the interest of the subject, and the able introduotion of

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Dear Sir,- In your number of
                            December 15th, 1905, you published an article on "England and Germany,"
                            wherein you said that the responsibility for British distrust against
                            Germany rested in a very large degree upon the shoulders of Prince von
                            Bülow, for, "if a collection of his official speeches were made, it
                            would be impossible to extract from them a single passage which was
                            friendly or sympathetic to England." Allow me to say that this statement
                            is not exact, as I could quote you many passages from the chancellor's
                            speeches wherein he expresses himsef in the most friendly manner on
                            Great Britain. But there is also a quite recent proof of Prince Bülow's
                            friendly dispositions towards your country, for the "Times" of the 27th
                            January contains the following letter directed by the Chancellor of the
                            German Empire to Mr. Fox, one of the honorary secretaries of the Anglo
                            German Friendship Committee:</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Fox,</p>
                        <p>Berlin, January 17.</p>
                        <p>I regret sincerely that my health has not permitted me to see you and
                            personally to confer with you about the work of the Anglo- German

                            aware, and I e with pleasure use of the opportunity afforded by your
                            kind visit to Berlin to repeat that the German Government: welcomes with
                            heartiest satisfaction, and will help forward all efforts tending to
                            promote better feelings between our countries.</p>
                        <p>In doing this it only confirms the conviction which I have already stated
                            on several occasions, and that not only recently, I may remind you of my
                            speech at the Reichstag, December 5, 1904, which I then stated was the
                            line of the Imperial policy.</p>
                        <p>I said in that speech: I hope the destinies of the two countries will
                            always be decided by the cool heads who know that Germany and England,
                            not only in the immediate present, but for all future time, as far as
                            human eyes. can see, will be best served by maintaining the present
                            peaceful relations.</p>
                        <p>Since then my conviction has not changed, and the formation of your
                            association has tended to confirm it.</p>
                        <p>Hoping that the Anglo-German Friendship Committee will continue to
                            prosper. - I am, yours very truly,</p>

                        <head>YOUNG TURKEY.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE Sir,-To the columns of the
                            "Egyptian Gazette," the Oriental organf free-thought and the medium
                            where y modern civilisation is circulated, I submit an article on Young
                            Turkey whose fundamental aims and principles. are misunderstood. I will
                            not enter deeply into the subject, but will merely give an outline
                            sketch, and make known the underlying principles of this body to the
                            world at large, and the Ottomans in particular.</p>
                        <p>The liberal movement which today is per sonated by Young Turkey,
                            commenced some fifty years ago, when the Old Tark's pinacle of might was
                            being undermined to such an extent that it was likely to fall.</p>
                        <p>The liberal movement to, modernise the Empire before its dismemberment
                            set in and ita integrity became attacked by the Occident, was made
                            manifest by his late Majesty of sacred memory, Sultan Abdul-Medje Khan
                            II., father to His Most Sacred Majesty, the Kaliph Sultan Abdul-Hamid
                            Khan II.</p>
                        <p>As an outcome of his political trend in recognition of the laws of
                            necessity, he had his dearly beloved son, the late Sultan Marad V., who
                            he thought, would one day sit on the throne of his forefathers, to ba
                            girded with the sword of Othman the Great, and to bear the raiment of
                            the holy Prophet, and educated most liberally in the greatest capitals
                            of Europe. His infantile days were carefully primed by the Orient of
                            days gone by, to imbibe the fraits of modern civilieation so that he
                            might remodel the Empire when once on the throne</p>
                        <p>of Othman.</p>
                        <p>The seed that germinated to bud some fifty years ago, is ramifying its
                            dendrite benes h the fertile soil to bort forth one day with the stored
                            up energy it absorbed through its ramification of dendrons. This
                            liberal, modernising spirit, which is the vital core of Young Turkey,
                            continued to multiply its adherents, until it became prominent under the
                            leadership of the famous Grand Viziers Ali and Fuad Pacha, who supported
                            it with unprece lented might and</p>
                        <p>energy.</p>
                        <p>In the same epoch, but after the death of Ali and Foad Pachas, this
                            reforming liberal spirit was embodied in the famons, patriot martyr, the
                            Grand Vizier Midhat Pacha, who Bacrificed all in order to develop
                            it.</p>
                        <p>He, with his associates, Mahemmet Ru-hid Pacha, Hussein Aveni Pacha,
                            Ahme? Kafterli Pachi and Shik-el-I-lam Hassein Ka'arallah, formed the
                            famous group of Islamic reformers who dero ed Sultan Abd l-Azz to
                            enthrone Mahemmet Murad Effendi. When the latter proved scrupulous
                            regarding tho dethronement of his uncle, Sultan Abdul-Aziz the Islamic
                            Triumvirate dethroned bim and placed Abdul- Hamid Effendi on the throne
                            of Othman. Midhat Pacha, at the Hamidian dawn, was <cb n="2"/> able to
                            introduce a National Representative Assembly, composed of 180 Mohamedan
                            members and 60 Christians. But the work, for whose construetion so much
                            was sacrificed, was done away with at the whim of the bigoted Edhem
                            Pacha, who replaced the exiled Midhat Pacha, who had elevated his Most
                            Sublime Majesty to the throne of Othman.</p>
                        <p>This Assembly was suspended in 1877, during the war with Montenegro, that
                            finally led to the Russo-Turkish conflict, when Edhem" Pacha besought
                            His Majesty to prorogue the Assembly that harassed him becure it
                            irquired into his doings. To this day the Representative Assembly is
                            prorogued. Thus the Old Turk regained his supremacy and forced the Young
                            Turk into the background. The above is a short description of the Young
                            Turkey movement. The aims of Young Turkey are the institution of a
                            National Representative Assembly and a responsible Cabinet or
                            Government. Were these prerogatives attained, re forms would be
                            institated to suit the needs of the nation as a whole, and the
                            particular requirements of each individual people or community,
                            regardless of creed or denomination. The motto of the society is the
                            consolidation of the Empire, and not its disintegration; its object is
                            the union of the whole into an entity, and not the fanatical, sectarian,
                            and racial isolation which rends the heart of the Empire to weaken it
                            and make it the prey and spoil of those who would never have attained to
                            their present position had anion, and not discord, predominated. Its
                            fundamental principle is to do away with these barriers, which have
                            reduced the state to a worse condition than feudal Europe of five
                            centuries ago, and to fraternise the whole.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is but a laconic depiction of the fundamental principles of
                            Young Turkey, which ought to be well studied and known by every true
                            Ottoman.</p>
                        <p>The members of the society are the enlightened and élite of the Empire;
                            they are the educated and true lovera of their country, who through
                            their liberal views have been exiled; many being forced to impose
                            self-exile on themselves. An illustration of this is the noble and
                            famous chief of the party, his Imperial Highness Prince Sabbah ud-Dein,
                            the grandson of Sultan Abdal-Medje and the nephew of his present
                            Majesty. He and his father and brother imposed self-exile on themselves,
                            and their property was cofi cated. This was the equence of their liberal
                            and reforming views. Had not, these liberal views and love of country
                            weighed most with them, they would have ba ked beneath the Imperial
                            smile. to reap the fruits thereof, as they belong to the Imperial
                            family. Yours very truly,</p>

                    <dateline>LONDON, Feb. 9.</dateline>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>The monetary position has engaged much attention in the City during the past
                        week, and the outlook still remains very obscure. The present abnormal state
                        of the market is due to the scarcity of loanable funds, and the action of
                        the Bank in squeezing the market, although perhaps a little too sudden, is
                        now fally justified. The political uncertainty attending the outcome of the
                        Morocco Conference, and Russia looming-as a prospective borrower, should
                        alone have convinced even the most captions critics of the Bank that some
                        suchaction was necessary. The som borrowed by the Bank is repayable on the
                        21st inst., by which time the revenue collections will be in fullswing, so
                        that very little relief can be looked for in the near future, and loans now
                        command 4% for the night, for a week, and even for a month.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, to those who are looking forward to easier conditions,
                        some consolation is found in the state of the foreign exchanges; with Paris
                        cheque at 25.16, gold withdrawals to that centre need hardly be feared. In
                        fact, French funds are being employed in this market, and with the Berlin
                        rate at 20.51 we are within measurable distance of receiving gold from that
                        quarter. The American exchange also stands greatly in our favour.</p>
                    <p>The low rate at which the Treasury bills were allotted on Weduesday,
                        practically 21%, gives no indication as to the condition of the discount
                        market, having been taken on foreign Government account-probably
                        Japanese-but bill brokers are still bidding 31 for forward delivery (say 10
                        days hence), although the spot rate is 3 to 4%. The Continent is still
                        buying bills in this market, which probably accounts for the easier forward
                        views.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday's Bank return discloses &amp; slightly stronger position. An influx
                        of bullion is shown on balances; the proportion of reserve is higher at
                        46.1, and although the other deposits show a slight decline, they still
                        stand at the respectable figure of nearly 42 millions. The Stock
                        Markets,</p>
                    <p>The feature of the week in stocks and shares has been the fine returns made
                        by the leading railways, with considerable increases in dividends, which
                        have caused great buoyancy in this market, and a general firmness in all
                        first-class securities, caused no doubt chiefly by the stringency of rates,
                        and the conservative policy adopted generally, which has had the effect of
                        weeding out the weak speculators. It would look as it both classes of
                        securities are well worth buying, as in view of the mag nificent trade
                        returns for January, which we print below, the prospects for the railways
                        daring the coming year are exceptionally bright; and the price at which
                        second class securities have arrived would seem to make them a safe
                        investment, particular'y the best South African mining shares. It is
                        understood that these shares are being accumulated by the big houses, who
                        have been purchasing very large lines, and who wili, no donht when it suits
                        them, bring abont a solid rise. It would not be so difficult to do this new.

                    <p>The market for gilt-edged stocks has exhibited a very firm tone since our
                        last and the price of Consols has advanced to 90. Advances are also recorded
                        in the other first-class securities.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds,</p>
                    <p>There has been some recovery of chrfidence in this market, and both Russiang
                        and Japanese have been dealt in at higher prices. Russian bonds close to

                    <p>The tone of depression which prevailed in the home railway market last week
                        has now given way to one of confidence. No doubt this has to a great extent
                        been due to the excellent dividend reports of the London and North Western
                        and the Farness Railways, and the highly satisfactory, traffic receipts for
                        the past week. The North Western dividend is announced at the rate of 7% per
                        annum, compared with 6% and in addition to paying the extra they carry
                        forward £93,000. as against £84.500. The Furness report is also very pleas.
                        ant reading, the Ordinary dividend for the past half year being fixed at 3
                        per cent, as compared with 1 per cent. This is due to the increased
                        prosperity of the iron trade, an increase which is likely to be
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>The Great Western dividend at the rate of 7%. which is the same as a year
                        ago, is not quite so satisfactory, the Stock Exhange having looked for an
                        increase of %; and the shares of the company eased off somewhat on the
                        Announcement. The stocks of the other companies are very firm.</p>
                    <p>Amerloans.</p>
                    <p>The American railway market has been quiet throughout the week and there are
                        no features</p>
                    <p>to report.</p>
                    <p>Egyptians. The Egyptian market has been exceedingly good during the week, and
                        a fair business has been done at advancing prices. National Bank of Egypt
                        have steadily advanced to 28, and the</p>
                    <p>last issue to 27. the former being two points bigher than they were a
                        fortnight ago. The rise in these shares is due to a well-grounded rumour
                        that the dividend is short'y to be declared at 9% instead of 7%. In addition
                        to this the prospects in the Sudan are con sidered good, and considerable
                        developments are expected in that direction. This should</p>
                    <p>also favourably affect Agricultural Banks, which, after being quiet, have
                        been taken in hand, <cb n="4"/>

                    <p>LES PROCHAINES ELECTIONS LES TAXES · </p>
                    <p>A megnre que sea recettes augmentent, notre municipalité majore les taxes
                        existantes et eu orée dè nouvelles. Tout loi est prétexte à innovation dans
                        ce sens. Il y a quelques années i seulement ces recettes ne dépassaient
                        guère d cent milla livres, aujourd'hui elles atteignent i deux cent
                        cinquante mille livres ; et au lieu de se contenter de la progression
                        produite par l'ac.. croissement de la ville, pos édiles ne pensent qa'à
                        décoa yrir de nouvelles sources de revenus et à groesir celles qui existent
                        déjà. C'est aingia que l'augmentation récente de la taxe de 50 - 150
                        piastres sur les voitures a déterminé la grève des cochers. Si l'argent
                        ainsi porça devait servir à l'entretien et à l'assainissement de la ville,
                        pange encore, maie tout est englonti 'par de vastes! projets, qui sont
                        grandioses sans doute, mais dont la nécessité est loin d'être aussi
                        pressante que la canalisation des roes et le drainage des quartiers. Le
                        balayage et l'arrosage sont, en outre, de plas en plus négligés. A part la
                        roe Rosette, la rae Chérif et le Boulevard de Ramleh, il n'y a de propres
                        que les rues bagtes balayées par le vent et nettoyées de temps à autre par
                        les pluies. Cependant, la taxe da 2 % qui est si onés rense et qui ne frappe
                        en définitive que les locataires a été créée expressément pour pro céder à
                        l'a-sainissement de la ville. Poisque ti rien n'est encore fait et que cette
                        taxa est d d'ailleurs dovenae ipotile, pairqu'elle a permis 8 de prendre sur
                        la mer des terrains qui soffisent lp amplement au but proposé, M. Zouro
                        conseille de la supprimer ou da moins d'en exonérer les fa locataires
                        pauvres. C'est une idée qu'il a coustamment soutenue et qu'il soutiendra
                        encore devant la Commission. </p>

                    <p>Caire, 14 février. </p>
                    <p>Les nouvelles tendancieuses propagées sur la Conférence d'Algésiras ne
                        paraissent pas avoir impressionné sérieusement les marobé d'Oecident. En
                        réalité, on s'est beaucoup plus effrayé lici qu'en Europe. A Londres, le
                        Consolidé anglais est resté, hier encore, invarié à 90 5/8. L'Unifiée &amp;
                        hausgé de 1/4 à 105 1/4. La Daïra Sanieh est demeurée inchargée à 18. Ls
                        National Bank &amp; bien reperda une 1/2 livre à 27 3/8 et l'Agricole 1/8 à
                        10 1/8; mais cette réaction pent être attribuée à la hausse précipités
                        réalisée récemment 'par des valeurs plutôt qu'aux informations d'ordre
                        politique. - A Paris, l'action Crédit Foncier Egyptien a réagi de 1 franc
                        seulement à 805. Par contre, la Banque d'Athènes a encore gagné 3 francs
                        &amp; 143. Notre marché des valeurs a été, ce matin, a88e2-animé et plus
                        forme qu'bier. La National Bank &amp; avancé &amp; 27 9/16 l'ac. tion
                        ancienne et 26 5/8 la nouvelle. L'Agricole s'est inscrite en clôture à 10
                        1/8 l'action ancienne et 9 11/16 la nouvelle émiesion. La Banque d'Abyssinie
                        a gagné 1/16 &amp; 6 7/8. Le monvement de hau889 quo nous pressentions hier
                        sur la Banque d'Athènes s'est dessiné dès ce matin. De 137, l'action a monté
                        à 143, gagnant 6 francs en und néance. Il y a liea de prévoir des cours plus
                        élevés. | La Cassa di Sconto est revenue de 198 &amp; 190 francs l'action
                        ancienne et de 193 &amp; 185 la nonvelle émission. L'action crédit Foncier a
                        progressé à 809. Los parts de joniggance Etux du Caire ont rattrapé à 265 la
                        perte qu'elles avaient faite hier. L'Immobilière &amp; avancé à 363 et
                        l'Agricole da Nil à 254. L'Union Foncière a été ramenée à 6 7/16 ot! les
                        Ciments à 81. | Le groupe des Hotels &amp; montré moins de farmeté: les
                        Nangovich ont rétrogradé à 13 9/16 et les Upper Egypt a'5 1/2 Les Baebler se
                        sont maintennes entre 4 11/16 at 4 3/4. | Parmi les porites valeurs, 188

                        11/33. Les Cotton Mills sont revenus à 6 h. 9 et les Markets å 24 sh. 9 Rien
                        de particulier à signaler sur les autres titres. La souscription aux 10,000
                        actions, offertes au public, de la Société d'Entreprises Immobilières et de
                        Travaux s'est ouverte anjourd'hui aux guichets de l'Anglo-Egyptian Bank -au
                        Caire et à Alexandrie. Elle sera close demain &amp; 5 heures de
                        l'après-midi. Nous restons à l'entière disposition de ceux de nos clients
                        qui voudraient souscrire par notre entremise. L'exploitation da New
                        Khedivial Hotel d'A. xandrih, sppartenant à la Société des Splendid. Hotels
                        of Egypt, continue à donner les résultats les plus promettante. D'après le
                        dernier état comparatif, les recettes pour la première décade du mois de
                        février courant se sont élevéas à environ L.E. 1,300 contre 710 ponr la
                        période correspondante de l'année passée, c'est-à-dire avec le surplus hau.
                        tement appréciable de L.E. 600. Cet accroissement, déja, ni marquant, des
                        revenus est appelé à prendre des proportions beancoup plus considérables dès
                        que les travaux l'agrandissement de l'hôtel auront été completement terminés
                        dans le courant da mois prochain. Aussi bieh il y a lieu d'attirer
                        l'attention sur le bas coats du titre, qui est à environ an quart de livre
                        seulement au-dessus da prix l'émission. Un mouvement de hatago ne saurait
                        tarder à se produire, et tout semble indiquer qu'il sera aussi ra pide
                        qu'important. </p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
