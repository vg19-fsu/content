                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                    <head>CRIMINALITY IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The judgment delivered by the special court against the prisoners tound
                        guilty of a murder- 008 assault on British officers has been criticised on
                        the ground of its great severity. Severe it undoubtedly was; but severity
                        was in this onso absolutely necessary. A display of leniency would have been
                        ill-timed and dange rons; indeed, we will go so far as to say that it might
                        have gravely compromised the security of official and non-official Europeans
                        in many provincial areas. Whatever the Nationalist Press may say, the
                        majority of landowners and of respectable cultivators are heartily in accord
                        with the judgment.</p>
                    <p>It is almost a literary convention to describe the fellah as a mild and
                        peaceful cultivator. The description is becoming less and less in</p>
                    <p>barmony with the facts in certain districts. The worst of these is Menoufieh
                        province, which has long had a disreputable pre-eminence in the criminal
                        statistics, and where murder, cattle poisoning, cotton palling, and assaults
                        on the person have been unpleseantly frequent daring the last five or six
                        years.</p>
                    <p>It may be asked-and with justice-whether this increase in crime does not
                        betoken certain weaknesses in the Administration. That the Ministries of the
                        Interior and of Justice have made occasional administrative errors need not
                        be disputad. Bat the true causes of this steady increase in criminality are
                        the unsuitability of the version of the Code Napoléon which has been adopted
                        by the Egyptian Government to the existing conditions, and the inadequacy of
                        the penalties usually inflicted. In 1884 a civilised legal system was
                        imposed upon a country where for all practical purposes there had been no
                        law but the will of the ruler and his satellites. Corporal
                        punishment-previous'y employed in nine cases out of ten as a means to
                        extract taxes or evidence from the peasants-was abolished. The popalation,
                        relieved from its cruellest burdens and delighted by the prospect of at last
                        resping what it had sown, gave little trouble for some years. A few gangs of
                        robbers had to be honted down, affrays between hostile villages occurred as
                        they occurred in Lane's days, but it was was not till the later 'nineties
                        that the peasants began to form a correct estimate of the risks that
                        attended criminality. In plain language, they realised that they found the
                        length of the law's foot. Judges, who gave sentence in accordance with the
                        evidence, must be supplied with such evidence as would almost compel them to
                        give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt. The result we know. Evidence was
                        manufactured, and in the Native Courts to-day perjary is universal and too
                        Irequently successful. When accuser and aceased bwear falsely as a rule,
                        extort evidence by bribes and threats, and hash the inoonvanient witness by
                        the menace of a trumpedup charge or of personal violence, the task of the
                        judges is rendered appallingly diffioalt. The native judge is inclined to
                        err on the side of leniency. The British judge,. handicapped by the want of
                        knowledge of the people and the language that is inevitable st the outset of
                        his career, is inclined to dis miss many a case on the ground of
                        insufficient evidence.</p>
                    <p>A case will show the lengths to which the Egyptian criminal is prepared to go
                        in the fabrication of evidence. It occurred at Denishwai. Darwish Zahran,
                        one of the four men recently executed, baaring a grudge against a neighbour,
                        dug up the body of a young girl from the village cemetery, threw it into his
                        enemy's "sakieb," and attended by numerous witnesses discovered the corpse
                        and denounced the luckless owner of the waterwheel on a charge of murder.
                        His enemy, Mahfouz, was fortunate in that the judgment, owing to information
                        received from an accomplice of the chief witness, went in his favour Hassan
                        Mahfouz, who himself boasted an uneviable record, was one of Zahran's com
                        panions on the scaffold at Dani-hwai! It is unnecessary to multiply
                        instances. Mr. Ma obell's note in Lord Cromer's report for 1905 may be
                        studied with advantage by those who require information on the subject. The
                        respectable inhabitants of almost any loca lity are often unwilling to make
                        any complaint to the authorities-they fear reprisals, and in some cases
                        their fears are well grounded. Moral and physical courage are alike rare
                        among the peasants. The possessors of both make perfect omdebs, but
                        unhappily there is not enough of them. The position has its risks. Two
                        omdehs have been murdered in Behers and three in Menoufieh during the past
                        six weeks.</p>
                    <p>An extensive modification of the present intricate Code may be an
                        impossibility. Bat it surely is not impossible to restore the only
                        punishment, death excepted, which the fellah fears. We refer to flogging.
                        For years the ondehs and sheikhs of villages, the large land owners and
                        notables, and an increasing proportion of the British and native officials
                        have demanded or suggested the revival of corporal punishment inflicted
                        under proper supervision upon persons found guilty of the more brutal forms
                        of personal assault. The native criminal does not enjoy penal servitude, but
                        refers to ordinary imprisonment as a stay in "Coles Pacha's lokanda" and
                        greatly appreciates the fact that he is there supplied with food, medical
                        attendance, and baths. Pain he dreads almost more than death, and if violent
                        crime is to be put down, no menace will be more potent. The only possible
                        alternative is co fisca'ion of property, and the objections to this penalty
                        are obvious enough. For one thing many oriminals have no property to be
                        confiscated; fines are useless; the pris ner refuses to pay and goes to gaol
                        rather than part with a piastre. The reintroduction of the kourbach may be
                        criticised as a retrograde measure, but, after all, what else will deter
                        rustic criminals of the type of the Danishwai fellaheen whose usual, taunt
                        is "Ma kantish abadan mahbous" ie, "You were never in gaol," Educate,
                        educate, ays the humanitarian reformer. But at present we have not the
                        edacators for the towns, much less for the fe'labeen.</p>

                            slope at an increasing speed. Half-a-mile away a num- ber of convicts
                            were asleep on the line. Said Bishr, realising their danger, succeeded
                            in springing on the engine at imminent risk to his own life, hampered as
                            he was by the leg chain and ball, and shut off steand just in time to
                            save his fellow-convicts. M. René Carton de Wiart Bey, Governor of
                            Tourab convict prison, brought the act to the notice of the authorities,
                            and Said Bishr is now a free man.</p>

                    <p>Out of the fifty-nine villagers who were accused by the general charge of
                        having taken part in the attack on British officers on the 13th inst, it
                        will be remembered that seven have not as yet been caught. We learn that a
                        most rigorous search for these men is still being carried on, and that in
                        the event of their being found they will be tried on the same charge as the
                        other acenred. We are unable to state at present, however, whether the trial
                        will be held by a similarly constituted special tribunal or by the ordinary
                        Native Courts, though it is presumed that it will be by the former.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the onbashi, of police who accompanied the officers, and
                        who was guilty of gross perjury before the special tribunal, has been placed
                        under arrest, and that he will very shortly be tried by court- martial for
                        neglect of daty in not carrying ont the orders of the officers and in making
                        no attempt to quieten the mob.</p>
                    <p>It is also said that the omdeh of Denishwai will be called before the court

                    <head>THE LESSON OF DENISHWAL</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE Sir,-The Denishwai incident is closed
                        and after a period of intense excitement there is a general wish to hear no
                        more of a disagreeable subject. But whatever may be our wishes Denishwai has
                        left its mark on the country and some little good may come out of much evil
                        if we can read its lesson aright.</p>
                    <p>First, we may take it as a rude check to the optimistic school. Clearly,
                        prosperity,diminished taxation, and fair treatment has had no miraculous
                        effect, upon the tellab. He has disappointed some of our local rulers and a
                        certain section of the public at home by a sudden relapse into ignorant
                        brutality-and his mental equilibrium bas only been restored by the
                        application of a proportionately severe corrective. Perhaps the belief that-
                        half a generation had sufficed to civilize the fellah when our own people
                        had occupied some centuries in the process, was a little too radiantly
                        optimistic to be seriously held, but it is undeniable that amongst certain
                        eminent persons in this country there had been some self delusion on this
                        point. Perhaps the wish was father to the thought. At any rate there has
                        been a rude awakening, and now it has been demonstrated that gratitude and
                        love of our rule are factors which cannot be relied on in the government of
                        this country.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we must expect a reaction in favour of what has been bluntly called
                        the "damned nigger" school. Many wild and whirling words have been spoken
                        and applauded in the last few weeks. "We must put the natives in their
                        proper place," or "We must teach them that they are not as good as we are,"
                        or "These people only understand force." These and such like phrases have
                        been heard on all sides, and accepted by many otherwise. sane, clear-headed
                        persons as "the lesson of Denishwai." Such opinions are never likely to
                        prevail with the responsible heads of the admi- nistration in this country,
                        but they are never- theless of value as showing how little fitted a certain
                        type of Englishman is for colonial administration.</p>
                    <p>This reactionary feeling is greatly strength- ened by an impression which,
                        rightly or wrongly, has got abroad. Certain incidents have led the public to
                        believe that the Govern- ment is only too glad of the opportunity of
                        punishing and publicly disgracing officials, who in the exercise of very
                        difficult duties and ander the greatest provocation have exceeded the limits
                        of moral saasion. Bratality doubtless En all forms must be discouraged, but
                        there are Occasions when the approved method of "turning the other cheek and
                        then drawing up a procès-verbal against the offender" bringe all Government
                        into contempt.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, even if we succeed in steering a middle course between dangerous
                        sentimentality on the one hand and force untampered by sympathy on the
                        other, there is still one thing needful more sight, more knowledge of what
                        the Government is doing and what it is about to do, more free discussion, le
                        s obscurantism amongst officials, more consulta tion with the various
                        interests concerned.</p>
                    <p>Once a year Lord Cromer takes the pablic into his confidence, freely
                        discussing the situation and his policy in dealing with it. If this
                        confidence could commence à little lower down in the official-scale and free
                        discussion and criticism on all Government measures be encouraged, a body of
                        public opinion, English, foreign and native, would be gradually formed which
                        would in time filter down to the lowest strata of society and give a firm
                        foundation to our Government. ANGLO-EGYPTIAN.</p>

                    <head>THE DENISHWAI OUTRAGE.</head>
                    <p>A PARALLEL EXPERIENCE IN 1864.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Alfred Dugdale, of Victoria Park, Manchester, has communicated to the
                        "Manchester Gaardian" the following description of an experience that
                        occurred 40 years ago, which is somewhat similar to the recent Denish wai
                        affair, though in the former case the results were happily less serious. He
                        writes:-Porty- two years since, in February, 1864, I began a residence in
                        Egypt which extended over the ten following years. At that time, and within
                        a few years of my arrival in the village of Kalioub, about eight miles north
                        of Cairo, I went out from the cotton-ginning factory where I was employed as
                        engineer, to shoot pigeons. I had noticed a good many about the village, and
                        had been told that they belonged to nobody in particular, and found
                        afterwards that this was partly true. I shortly came across a flock of
                        pigeons, and firing amongst them brought one down. As I ran forward to pick
                        it up I felt a hand on my shoulder and found myself in the custody of an
                        armed cavass, or policeman, who immediately Seized my gun, shot bag, and
                        powder flask and handed them to two companions. They then marched me off
                        unresistingly, and feeling rather amused than alarmed. In a very few minutes
                        I found myself in what I suppose was the police court. I held out some money
                        and signed that I wanted to pay for the bird I had shot, but the officials
                        shook their heads. I knew very few words of the language (Arabic) at that
                        time, but gathered that nothing could be done except to take me to
                        Alexandria to the Brit Consal. Ultimately, however, a young gentleman in
                        official (Stambouli)costume was brought, who spoke English fluently. He
                        asked me why I had shot the pigeon. I replied that I had done it for amuse-
                        ment, and was willing to pay for it if the owner could be found. He told me
                        that the pigeons really belonged to the village, being originally wild but
                        encouraged to come to the tall towers I could see near the village in order
                        that the dung might acon- mulate at the foot of the tower. He then asked me
                        if I had noticed that on the pre vious day several hats in the village had
                        taken fire, and asked it I did not think it quite likely that my shooting
                        had been the cause. I replied that I was sure it had not, for the simple
                        reason that 1 had not been out shooting the day before, adding that I
                        thought I could account for the fires as being the result of spontaneous
                        combus- tion, caused by the accumulation of straw and manure in layers,
                        which were allowed to accumulate on the house-tops through the goats and in
                        some cases donkeys sleeping there, and being ledded down each night with
                        fresh straw on the top of the past day's manure. He said it might be so, but
                        he did not seem to understand my theory. Ultimately I was asked to promise
                        not to shoot in the village any more, which I readily did, upon which my
                        gan, &amp;c., as well As the pigeon, were returned to me, and I was allowed
                        to depart in peace. I was alone, and, not being a military man, had little
                        or no temptation to resist my captorr. ENGLISH SEAMAN DROWNED.</p>

                    <p>An inquest was held yesterday by the British Consular Court on the body of
                        Maurice Ham- mond, fireman of the S.S. Rects, who met his death on Sunday
                        afternoon by falling into the water from the railway bridge which crosses
                        the Madmoudieh Canal near the Seamen's Home. The jury found a verdict of
                        "Accidental Death" and added an expression of opinion that it is desirable
                        that a watchman should be placed on the bridge to prevent men from
                        attempting to cross by it.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the evidence it was shown that a fireman named Andrew
                        Kavenagh, of the 8.8 Sir W. T. Lewis, who happened to be near the spot,
                        promptly dived under the bridge and ultimately succeeded in bringing the
                        body to the surface. Efforts were made to restore ciousness, but in
                        vain.</p>
                    <p>The coroner and the jury complimented Andrew Kavenagh upon his conduct, which
                        would probably have saved the man's life had he not injured his head in
                        falling.</p>

                        para- graph in the "Gazette" of the 26th inat,, re the fire at Keneh prison,
                        I would like to state that owing to scarcity of water "our fire. brigade"
                        had very little to do with the extin- guishing of the fire, which went out
                        in two hours for the simple reason that everything combustible in the
                        portion of the prison where the fire occurred had been consumed. It is
                        difficult to understand how the Government, which incurred the heavy expense
                        of the new prison construction, could not afford to spend another L.E. 50 in

                            Sudan, and the importance of Baakin bas diminished greatly. Goods for
                            the interior of the Sudan all land now at Port Sudan, and the export of
                            gum, etc., is all shipped from Port Sudan, The Sudan Customs have also
                            greatly increased their staff there.</p>
                        <p>The Sudan Railways are despatebing large quantities of coal daily to
                            Kbartoom and other places for sale to Government Departments and
                            merchants at about half the price which coal cost before when conveyed
                            by the river Nile, Cheap coal will tend to the greater use of machinery
                            in the Sudan.</p>
                        <p>Another wash out took place yesterday. near Gebeit station, but very
                            little damage was done. Bimbaabi Lord at once went to the spot and put
                            things right.</p>
                        <p>The steam dredger belonging to Mr. Bencini, the quays contractor at Port
                            Sudan, which was reported some time ago as having sunk, has now being
                            salved, and will be out of the water in a few days.</p>
                        <p>The Italian gunboat Agostino Barberigo has been at Port Sudan for several
                            days. Her commander left by rail from Port Sudan for Khartoum. As soon
                            as the commander returns to Port Sudan the Agostino Barberigo will leave
                            for Massowah.</p>

                        <head>DEVELOPMENT OF PORT SUDAN.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. Sir-The Alexandrian public may
                            like to learn something about the public works comple ted or under
                            consideration at Port Sudan. The land question in this new town is also
                            of importance, and I hope to prove that the Sadan Government, as I
                            understand from my observations, is not inclined to speculation, as has
                            been stated by some writers who do not realise its paternal
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>The principal object of the Government is the civilisation and prosperity
                            of the country by cultivation and trade. It opposes that variety of
                            speculation which differs very little from gambling.</p>
                        <p>The Sudan Government, realising the dan- gerous consequences of unsound
                            speculative enterprises, which after an ephemeral prosperity collapse,
                            decided from the first to oppose their growth for the sake of the work
                            which it is doing in the cause of humanity and the pros perity of the
                            Sudan.</p>
                        <p>To safeguard the country from this danger the Sudan Government, after
                            ripe reflection, decided to give in lease from next November, the sites
                            at the new town of Port Sudan, and impose such terms on the lessees that
                            specula- tion would in no way be facilitated, but the construction of
                            different buildings which would contribute to the completion of the town
                            and therefore to its commercial progress and to the concentration and
                            exchange of the different products of the country would derive the
                            maximum of benefit.</p>
                        <p>The new town of Port Sadan will become a link between Europe, the Cape,
                            and India, and a commercial centre where the steady merchant will grow
                            rich through the logical and gradual growth of the prosperity of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Port Sudan as a town is only one year old, and has at present about six
                            thousand inhabi tante. It is laid out on bygienic principles, and
                            contains several public buildings, com- pleted or in course of erection,
                            viz, the public schools, telegraph and post offices, the moudirich, the
                            barracks, the large customs warehouses, the electrical station for the
                            lighting of the town, eto.</p>
                        <p>The Government intends to build an ex- change in Port Sudan, but it would
                            be more preferable, in my opinion, to reject any such ides. It would be
                            more logical, I think to consider the formation of a Chamber of Commerce
                            under the direct supervision of the Government.</p>
                        <p>The town is divided by the harbour into two parts, Eastern and Western,
                            which will communicate by an opening bridge of thirty metres. The
                            preliminary work on the bridge has already begun. The work at the docks
                            and barbour is being carried out with feverish activity, the plans for
                            the laying of the streets and for the drainage are completed, and also
                            the schethe for the supply of drinkable water from Khor Arbst. In a
                            short time the work on the electric telodrome for the transport of goal
                            from the seaside to the warehouses will be commenced and in general all
                            the public works are being quietly executed.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I should like to mention the name of the Director of
                            Works, Kaimakam Kennedy Bey, a man of wide knowledge, great activity,
                            and remarkable administrative ability. The Sudan Government has found in
                            Kennedy Bey, a man whose energy will solve many pro. blems of the Sudan.
                            He is the responsible man in my mind for the choice of a site for the
                            town of Pert Sudan, which is as regards health and position
                            excellent.</p>

                    <head>ENGLAND IN EGYPT.<lb/>HANDS. A SWORD IN BRITISH HANDS.</head>
                    <p>Continuing his long letter, published in leader form in "Al Zaher," Abou
                        Shadi Bey remarks that England occupied Egypt to suppress a revolution and
                        afterwards began to act as a reforming Power. "Her reforms are deceptive,
                        but we should have supported her views and her policy till the day when we
                        were strong enough to require her to fulfil ber promises. Such was the
                        policy we ought to have followed-the only possible policy for a weak and
                        ignorant race pitted against a strong and enlightened Power, but we followed
                        an absolutely contrary policy, with bad results for ourselves.</p>
                    <p>"British policy had been cautions enough- no pillars were demolished-a few
                        posts occn- pied by Englishmen when H. H. the Khedive began his reign. At
                        that time Britain had little else in view but the preservation and
                        guardianship of the Suez Canal, upon which depends the safety of the Indian
                        Empire. Had the Egyptians received their new ruler quietly, had they
                        co-operated with the occupying Power, the day of England's withdrawal from
                        Egypt would soon have come. However, the Egyptians lost their heads, utterly
                        failing to realise their position.</p>
                    <p>"Helbawi Bey published a series of articles in 'Al Mosyad' which caused great
                        excitement among the populace, and the Boglish watched and noted the change.
                        From the day when Helbawi Bey and some of his friends dragged H. H. the
                        Khedive's carriage in triumph before the Morque of Hussein the occupants
                        began to tighten their grasp. British influence meantime increased and our
                        power declined to its present weakness. At present the Nationalist party's
                        strength is non-existent, and England can fetter the Egyptians at her
                        pleasure. The first link of one of these fetters was the creation of the
                        special court to try offences committed against the Army of Occupation. Bat
                        did any member of the Legislative Council request the British Diplomatis
                        Agent to abolish that court by which any punishment could be inflicted
                        without appeal? Did any one go to far as to demand that the court should at
                        least be international in its composition ............ Under the
                        circumstances the court is simply a sword in British hands and a sharp
                        sword." "Al Lewa" covers twalve columns with an article written by Helbawi
                        Bey and published by "Al Mosyad" fifteen years ago. The article was directed
                        against British policy in Egypt, and "Al Lowa" declares that it republishes
                        it to show the public what a remarkable con- version the Bey has
                        experienced.</p>

                    <p>THE GRANTS-IN-AID.</p>
                    <p>A supplement to Monday's "Official Journal" contains a code of regulations
                        relating to grants-in-aid of kattabs. Theee grants are given to enable the
                        kattabs to develop into elementary schools suited to the requirements of the
                        mass of the people. To be eligible for a grant every kattab inscribed on the
                        registers of the Ministry must be able to show an average attendance of 25
                        pupils and must be open at any time to inspection by the Minis try. An
                        entrance register and a register of atttendance must be regularly kept by
                        the headmaster. Independently of religious instruc- tion the school
                        curriculam must comprise in- struction in the Arabic language and writing.
                        and in elementary arithmetic, which must follow the lines of a syllabus
                        attached to the decree and must be given regularly in accord- ance with a
                        specimen time table appended therato or a time-table submitted to and
                        approved by the Ministry. Subject to the approval of the Ministry the time
                        table may be modified in accordance with agricultural exigencies. The
                        grants-in-aid will be awarded by the Ministry of Education within the limits
                        of the funds set apart for the purpose after consideration of the reports

                    <p>A native living at Bab Sidra Barrani, near Karmous, was admitted to hospital
                        suffering from plague on Thursday and died on Sunday. Yesterday, a Sudanese
                        was found dead from plague in the same district. The man had been employed
                        at the Gabbari railway station.</p>
                    <p>Daring the week ending on the 1st July, eleven cases of plague were notified
                        in Egypt, of which one occurred at Alexandria, one in the district of
                        Samalout, Minieh province, and nine in the district of Yems, Ghirgeh
                        province. The nine cares which were notified at Yema all occurred in one
                        family in the village of El Mawatine, and 60 people who had had commu-
                        nication with this family have been placed under close cbservation. Daring
                        the same week nine cases ended fatally, five cares were effec- ted, and
                        seven remain under treatment.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning of the year until the lat July, 370 cases of plague have

                        Raffinerie d'E- gypte, dont le Comité de Défense vous a adressé le tex'e, a
                        été voté, par l'unanimité des créanciers représentés l'Assemblée con-
                        oordataire qui s'est tenue au Caire le 23 Mai dernier.</p>
                    <p>Si l'on tient compte que sept cents obliga taires, porteur de 11.546
                        obligations, dont les titres n'ont pas pu parvenir au Caire en temps utile,
                        avaient (l'exception d'un seal) donné mandat à M. Saint-Plancat de voter
                        pour le Concordat, on peut évaluer à près de 45 mil- lions de francs en
                        chiffres rond, le montant des créances dont les porteurs se sont prononcés
                        en faveur du Concordat</p>
                    <p>Le 2 jain, le Tribunal da Caire a homologué le texte des proportions
                        concordataires. Au- cune opposition ne s'est produite dans les délais légaux
                        et le jugement d'homologation est passé en force de chose jagée, à dater du
                        20 Jain courant.</p>
                    <p>La Société des Sucreries vient d'informer le Comité de Défense qu'elle
                        faissit procéder actuellement à l'impression des obligations nouvelles, et
                        que leur échange avec les ancien- nes serait fait dans le plus bref délai
                        possible. Le premier coupon fire intérimaire de 4. francs vient à l'échéanee
                        le 1er Juillet 1906 et sera payé dès la remise des nouveaux titres à ceux
                        des obligataires qui voudront les faire estampiller.</p>
                    <p>Aussitôt que la Société aura fait connaltre la date et les conditions de
                        l'estampillage des nouveaux titres, prévu par l'article 8 da Con- cordat,
                        les porteurs en seront avisés par les soins da Syndicat des obligations. En
                        effet, le Concordat étant définitivement homologué, le Comité de Défense
                        doit considérer sa mission comme terminée, et laisser an Conseil d'admi-
                        nistration du Syndicat des Obligataires, qui re trouve constitué ipso facto,

                        concerne l'exécution des clauses de cet arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Le siège social du Comité restera jusqu'à nouvel ordre dans les bureaux de
                        l'Association 5 rue Gaillon, à Paris.</p>

                    <head>MIDSUMMER PIXIES.</head>
                    <p>Piskies, pixies, or pigseys, are a tribe of elves peculiar to o'd Cornwall, a
                        territory once extending to the eastern edge of Dart- moor, which is still
                        included in the Duchy. They are not elemental spirits, but in mate- rial
                        life were these of the keltio tribes who refused to give up their ancient
                        religion for Christianity, but otherwise lived blameless; hence their
                        sympathy with humanity. Not good enough for Heaven, nor bad enough for bell,
                        their wandering souls were permitted to remain on earth baunting their owa
                        familiar moorlands wooded coombes, and waste ses beaches. In early May and
                        during the reign of the harvest moon they are active. in revel, but their
                        chief festival of the year is held on Midsommer Eve. With the passing of
                        many centuries they have greatly shrunken in size, and are now
                        indistinguish- able, by daylight, from ants, moths, or batter- flies, except
                        by those intimately acquainted with their appearance. A troop of these
                        sprites was bebeld, of late years, by one who bad the gift of such sight, on
                        a sunny, hillside one brilliant summer afternoon. They were dancing amid the
                        heather-bells, climbing tall foxgloves, tumbling queer somersault, cutting
                        fantastic capers, and, as the Cornish saying runs, "laughing like a pisky."
                        This shows them to be a merry race. Apparently they are gradually becoming
                        converted to Christianity, for on Christmas Eve they assemble in the deepest
                        mines to celebrate the Holy season, when solemn, entrancing music may be
                        heard, and choirs of unearthly voices chanting "Nowell: Nowell</p>
                    <p>They are tricksy elves, skilled in glamour, and illusion. A favourite deceit
                        of theirs is enticing the lonely night traveller into boga by appearing like
                        the light in eottage win- dow, or a man walking with a lantern aerose ground
                        where no haman foot on tread in safety. They steal pretty babies from the'r
                        cradles, leaving ngly changelings in their places. If spoken of
                        disrespectfally, or event mentioned by name, they take violent offence.
                        Hence they are e lled "The Others," the "Small People in Green," or the
                        "Good Folks." At Germol is a green Jane well-known as a resort of fairies.
                        Oacs, on Midsummer Eve, two tinners who worked at Croft Gothal, a mine hard
                        by, were returning late down this Bat-lane aforesaid, and found it fall from
                        end to end of he little people, holding a fair or high fastival. Among the
                        crowd one of the men recognised his own child; for one evening the boy had
                        been as beautiful as could be seen, and next morning was ugly, weazened, and
                        altered. Therefore the Others must have change! him. When relating this tale
                        next day at Croft Gothal, he was saddenly thrown into a deep pit and almost
                        killed. When carried home, his wife, furious at the cause of their
                        misfortunes, exclaimed that the pixies were taxin', tricksy devils."
                        Instantly she fell backwards into the fire, and was burned severely, a
                        convincing proof that these elvas must not be trifled with.</p>
                    <p>At Treonike, a small hamlet in St. Austell parish, a boy was once beguiled
                        away from his home, lost for many days, and finally, after all hope of
                        finding him had been given up, he was one morning discovered, fast sleep on
                        a tuft of bracken, hard, by his father's cottage door. His own story ran
                        that he had been playing near that spot on the day of his disappearance,
                        when he heard most exquisite music in the air. At first be mistook this for
                        bird-songs, but soon realised that the Little People must be the unseen
                        musicians. Following the sounds, he easily penetrated a thicket whose depths
                        he had never before succeeded in entering; for some invisible guide smoothed
                        the under- growth in his path, while causing thorns and briars to spring up,
                        closer and more matted than formerly, bebind him and on either hand. Also,
                        the music became more and more ravishing. At last he found himself upon the
                        shore of a small lake, which, to his surprise, reflected the sky thick with
                        stars, though it had been full noontide on the common but a short time
                        earlier. Then a lovely lady came through the darkness, tock him by the hand,
                        and led him about un- derground palaces, with crystal arohes glowing with
                        changing tinte, far finer than any ca verns in the deepest mine. There be
                        saw many marvellous sights, feasted on dainties be had never tasted in his
                        life before, gam- bolled or conversed with troops of merry playmates, all
                        beautifully dressed in green. At last he fell asleep from shear weariness,
                        and awoke in the spot where he had first beard the Pisky Minstrels.</p>
                    <p>The Gamp, a knoll near St. Just, is a noted spot for Pixy revels. Many werthy
                        folks have been privileged to witness their feasts, in a spirit of
                        friendliness, and often ware given valuable presents. But an old miser in
                        this country had his avarice so much in- flamed by accounts of the wonderful
                        treasures displayed by these good neighbours that he determined to intrade
                        upon their high festival of Midsummer Eve despite express warnings not to do
                        so. Accordingly he set, forth, by moonlight so brilliant that the night
                        seemed a softened day. As he advanced towards the Gump he began to hear
                        entrancing yet mysteri- ous masie. He could not tell whether it was in the
                        air or under the earth, if close at his ears or far away, but its influence
                        was strangely compelling. As it was gay or solemn, so was he moved to tears
                        or laughter, and also- obliged to dance fantastically in obedience to its
                        strains. Still he persevered, determined to keep his wits awake and seizs
                        oppor tunities. Then, with a rending, crashing sound the Gump split open,
                        and he saw a vast hall, ablase with many-coloured lights, spread for
                        feasting with plates and vesse's ct gold and jewels. Here the legend gives
                        circumstantial description of the revels,</p>
                    <p>interesting, but far too long for quota- tion. Meanwhile, the intruder,
                        apparently unnoticed, crept slowly nearer, hat in band, intending to cover
                        with this the royal table, not knowing that thogsands of pixies had cast
                        tiny chains about him. He raised the hat, as a boy catches a batte fly, when
                        a hrill whistle was heard, his hand remained powerless, fixed in the air,
                        and all became dark. Then came whirring coises, as though a swarm of bees
                        darted past. He was racked, pinched, tortured in every limb, pulled to the
                        ground, and, there chained im- moveably, even his tongue tied with cords, so
                        that the sad resource of howling was denied. This continued till the sun
                        arose, when he found himself covered with innumer- able gossamer threads.
                        Aching and bruised, he retreated homewards, nor did his affairs ever prosper
                        afterwards. ("Globe.")</p>

                    <p>Lieut-General Sir Ian Hamilton visited Birmingham last week in order to
                        unveil a memorial erected in Cannon Hill Park to the local men who took part
                        in the South Africant Campaign. In the course of an address, the General
                        said more and more did civilisation seem to lay stress upon the value of
                        life, until now even its most feeble and flickering mani- festation was
                        jealously guarded from natural extinction. Yet let them pause and see by
                        their side the revival of an Eastern civilisa tion which regarded life as
                        utterly worthless, a breath, a bubble, compared with the national honour and
                        the divinity of an Emperor. The Western spirit shuddered at the idea of
                        death stalking grim and terrible over the stricken field; the other, he
                        could tell them from his own experience, exulted at such a chance, at so
                        rich, so supreme an opportunity. On the present occasion they felt there was
                        something higher in this world than that modern senti- mentalism, which was
                        sometimes akin to softness. The men commemorated, however poor and rough the
                        conditions of their life might have been, yet cherished in the back ground
                        of their thoughts an ideal, and that ideal was that they held their lives in
                        fee for their King and country.</p>

                    <head>THE KORDOFAN RISING.</head>
                    <p>The sharp punishment inflicted by O'Con nell Bey on the brigand tribes of
                        Kordofan should abate their craving for robbery and murder until its
                        remembrance has grown faint. Had these pests got the upper hand even for a
                        brief time, all the local forces of lawlessness -hey are exceptionally large
                        would have rallied to the winning side, and Kordofan might have again become
                        the home of Mah- dism. That sort of danger is always present in the
                        outskirts of the Sudan, especially on the west side; the tribesmen are not
                        only fiercely fanatical, but greatly. given to the acquisition of other
                        people's property by violent methods. But it should be of happy omen that
                        the Bag- gara clans, the ravagest and most predacious of all, instead of
                        joining the rebels, hunted them into the desert, and thus allowed time for
                        Governor O'Connell to effect the relief of the little beleaguered garrison
                        at Talodi. We may pretty safely count upon the emission by Mr. Byles and his
                        colleagues of vebement pro- tests against the slaying of such dove-like
                        innocents. But these Radical outpourings of spurious humanitarianism have
                        largely lost their vogue in Parliament, as have the exag- gerated
                        lamentations of the Aborigines Pro- tection Society. What British
                        civilisation has- on its hands in the Sudan interior is the crushing of
                        lawlessness by whatever methods seem calculated to prove most effectual.
                        That is the only sound foundation on which to build op order and peaceful
                        industry. The overthrow of the Khalifa at Omdurman was only the begin ning
                        of that process.-(Globe.")</p>

                    <head>FEEDING AN ARMY.</head>
                    <p>The continued flow of evidence as to the mismanagement of war stores in South
                        Africs serves to glorify Wellington by contrast for the way in which he
                        managed these matters. High as he always rated Napoleon, he con- sidered
                        himself the better man of the two at feeding an army. His own losses, he
                        used to say, would have been infinite'y greater but for his attention to the
                        subsistence of his men. "The French armies ware made to take their chance
                        and to live as they could, and their loss of men was immense." It struck him
                        as very singular that in every history of Napo leon's campaign which he bad
                        read this very serious feature had never been clearly shown "anything like
                        its full extent." So he put it.</p>
                    <p>This question of feeding once led Earl Stanhope to remark to the Duke that it
                        was strange that the French should have subsisted at Santarem so much longer
                        than could have been expected. "It could hardly have been called subsisting
                        we oquld not bave subsisted in that country," answered Wellington. It could
                        only have been done by that system of utter disregard of human life which
                        prevailed in the French army." And he recalled a letter which he had
                        received from a Portuguese gentleman residing at Santarem." I had a cat," it
                        rar, "and Heaven forgive me if I do them an irjastice, but I do believe the

                        nations are represented in addition to those which sent delegates to the
                        Manchester Congress.</p>
                    <p>Herr Ferd (Germany), who presided, ex- tended a hearty welcome to the dele
                        gates. He said he was pleased to see so many delegates from England and
                        France, where certain exchanges existed, and hoped they would gain valuable
                        information at Bre- men, where a certain exchange was worked by merchants
                        and spinners on equal terms. He remarked that foreign papers some- times
                        wrote about. German competition, not always in a friendly manner, but he
                        held that nearly all progress in the industry could be traced to
                        competition, which kept people fresh and industrious. What was needed was
                        the removal of ill feeling sometimes apparent in competition between
                        nations, and far-seeing men had been working strenuously of late to secure
                        this end, holding that the chief guaran- tee of the peace of the world was a
                        promoter of international industry to secure permanent goodwill. Matual
                        respect must prevail always and everywhere between nations, and in promoting
                        goodwill congresses of men engaged in one industry were of incalculable
                        value.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Macara (England). dealing with the work of the Committee and the Congress
                        during the year, said the International Federation might claim to have
                        justified its existence, as it had materially mitigated difficulties created
                        by temporary shortness of supply of cotton, and had prepared the way for the
                        subsequent prosperity of the trade. It became clearer each succeeding year
                        how hopeless it was for an individual asscciation, or even a ration, to deal
                        single handed with vast issues which affected more or less the destinies of
                        the many millions who were dependent on the cotton industry. In a friendly
                        meeting of the men of different nationalities, all engaged in the same
                        industry, would be found the best means of dealing with difficulties and
                        dangers of remov ing national jealousies and promoting peace and
                        goodwill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. MacAlister (England), reporting on the visit he and others paid to the
                        Southern States of America last year, said that in America little or no
                        attempt was made to protect cotton from the westher after it had been
                        picked, and in consequence it need surprise no one that European spinners
                        had to complain of exces sive moisture in the cotton. The attention of the
                        Southern Planters' Association was called to this and other defects, and a
                        Committee composed of these gentlemen recommended that sheds and warehouses
                        to protect the cotton be erected, that all bales be of standard dimensions,
                        that all cotton be sold by weight, and that cotton b3 baled in lighter
                        material. Owing to the superior packing of Egyptian cotton the coat of
                        freight from Alexandria to Liverpool was 18c. per 100lb., while from New
                        Orleans to Liverpool the cost was 30c. per 100lb. A reduction of 5c. per
                        100b. would effect a saving to European spinners in ocean charges alone of
                        £3,500 annually.</p>

                    <head>THE PLAGUE TERROR.</head>
                    <p>INFECTED RATS AND THE SPREAD OF DISEASE.</p>
                    <p>Early last year the Secretary of State for India, at the instance of the
                        Royal Society and the Lister Institute, appointed a small expert committee,
                        headed by Dr. C.J. Martin, director of the Lister Institute, to inquire into
                        the natural history of plague and the scientific problems connected with its
                        pro- pagation and dissemination, in the hope that, if knowledge on these
                        matters could be secured, some progress might be made in the practical
                        methods of combating the disease. The investi gations of the committee have
                        been chiefly carried on in the Parel laboratory, Bombay, and the "Pioneer"
                        states that it now seems likely that the whole problem of the disease will
                        turn on the species of rat and rat flea which carry the infection. Dr.
                        Martin is reported to hold that whether plague be primarily a rat disease
                        and epidemics among human beings merely a participation of man in what is
                        scientifically known as the epizootic, the intimate relation- ship of the
                        two is undoubted. Hence there are the strongest reasons for beliewing that
                        infec ted rats are the most important cause of the epidemic spread of
                        plague. The common Indian (the black variety) has the habit of climbing and
                        lives in the roofs of hats as well as in "runs." It is thus always on the
                        move among human beings, and proofs continue to accumu- late that the
                        conveyance of the plague bacillus to man is mainly from the rat or his
                        parasite the fles. The germs of infection may be absor bed through abrasions
                        of the skin or be taken into the system with focd, while the flea that has
                        become infected undoubtedly carries the bacillus into healthy living bodies,
                        as nume- rous experiments with rats have shown. Such questions as the habits
                        of rats and their breeding seasons, and the existence of subacute or chronic
                        plague among them in the hot months when the disease is not epidemic in
                        Indis are being closely studied by the com- mittee. From 500 to 1,000 rats
                        have been examined in the most elaborate way, and the existence and extent
                        of the disease throughout the year will thus, it is hoped, be determined.
                        The "East-India (Progress and Condition)" report, lately presented to
                        Parliament, shows that during the seven years 1899 1905 the total recorded
                        plague mortality in India was 4,059,800, the deaths registered in 1905 being
                        950,600, as against 1,144,900 in the preceding year.</p>
