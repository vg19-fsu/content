                    <head>THE NAVAL BATTLE. </head>
                    <p>All our telegrams show that the Russian and Japanese fleets will soon be
                        within range of one another's guns, and that a great naval battle is
                        imminent, for the Russians have passed Singapore and the warships of both
                        Powers are reported to have been sighted in the Straits of Malacca. For the
                        next few hours the whole civilised world will be engaged in speculating on
                        the Russians' chances of success against the squadron commanded by Admiral
                        Togo. On paper the Russian fleet is a formidable force, in spite of the
                        presence of some weak units, such as the "Dimitri Donskoi" and the "Almaz,"
                        which never made her legend speed, and was originally intended to serve as
                        Admiral Alexeieff's yacht. The four battleships of the "Suvoroff' class, the
                        "Oslabya" and the cruisers "Olez," "Izumrud" and "Jemtchug," are modern and
                        formidable vessels, and the "Navarin" and 'Lissoi Veliki," though old, are
                        heavily armed and armoured vessels. The rest are not worth much against
                        opponents who can shoot straight, and the fourth squadron's composition
                        renders it unlikely that it will lie in the line with Rodjestvensky's force.
                        Of the vessels that compose it, "Nicolai I." is old and slow, and the three
                        little ironclads of the "Senjavin" class would probably hamper the squadron
                        greatly in the day of battle. To begin with, they are low freeboard vessels
                        and would find it hard to fight their turret guns in anything like a sea.
                        Their speed is also not a strong point and they bave very low bunker
                        capacity: finally, they suffer from their lack of trotection-they are
                        vulnerable everywhere above the belt, for their three turrets have no
                        armoured bases in the form of a redoubt, only <cb n="6"/>an armoured hoist
                        which would not prevent shells bursting under the turrets from injuring
                        their supports and perhaps causing them to settle down on the lower deck or
                        thereabouts, to the great peril of the ship. All these considerations make
                        it probable that the Russian leader will use them as a guard for his
                        portentously large convoy, and it will be interesting to see whether he
                        leaves his spare colliers and slow transports at Diego Garcia or some island
                        in the Indian Ocean to await them or waits for them in the Indian Ocean and,
                        when he finds the Japanese, leaves them with his colliers and fights
                        unhampered. There is another course open to him, namely, to go ahead and
                        trust to his ships to damage the Japanese so much that the fourth squadron
                        will be able to get through to Vladivostok with part at least of the first
                        three divisions.</p>
                    <p>Altogether the situation, assuming that Russian Admiral pushes on, is decic
                        edly. plex. He has two advantages: a large of routes, for there are
                        half-a-dozen streits tween Timor and Java which he may select, and a
                        superiority in large armoured battleships and heavy guns. Against this the
                        Japanese have a superiority in modern armoured vessels, for their armoured
                        cruisers have done good service in the line and their crews and officers
                        have the confidence engendered by success and the practical experience of
                        warfare that their opponents lack. We therefore doubt the Russian Admiral's
                        capacity to inflict a defeat on Togo's fleet, unless the Japanese losses
                        have been far more severe than they confess. Even in that case a partial
                        success would leave the Russians in a worse position, especially if it
                        involved the loss of any large proportion of their colliers. Their nearest
                        base is Vladivostok, while the Japanese can fall back on Formosa for coal
                        and supplies and dock injured vessels in their ports. Altogether the chances
                        are decidedly in favour of Admiral Togo but the Russians have the gam
                        instinct and realise that while failure the them little worse off, a victory
                        might ceivably change the course of the war.</p>

                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM. NEW THEORY OF STRAIN EXPLAINED.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) </byline>
                    <dateline>London, April 3. </dateline>
                    <p>There has hardly been time yet to have received the criticisms of the wise
                        men of Europe and America on the recent decisions of the Egyptian Government
                        to postpone—for tho present-the completion, as some eminent men are pleased
                        to call it, of the dam at Assouan by increasing the height by some eighteen
                        feet. Such men do not care to commit themselves in a hurry when a fresh
                        proposition, of a nature such as this, is first put before them. We must
                        have patience yet before we can expect to receive the general opinions of
                        scientific authorities. </p>
                    <p>For one, however, who has been familiar with all the details of this great
                        work from the commencement, as is tho case with the consulting engineer, Sir
                        Benjamin Baker, it is not surprising that he should give the public the
                        benefit of his views, however slight, as early as possible. They have indeed
                        a right to expect it. Sir Benjamin has informed a reporter of the "Daily
                        Mail" that this decision of tho Egyptian authorities is by no means entirely
                        due to tho theories recently propounded by the learned mathematicians.
                        Primarily it is due, according to Sir Benjamin, to the fact that during his
                        recent visit he found it neccessary to advise the authorities that the
                        apron, or floor of masonry, a small portion of which was put down last year,
                        must be extended along the whole length of the dam, so as to protect the
                        base of the structure from any mischief in future, such as might be caused
                        by the great rush of water through the sluices which at times, when it rises
                        to the sixty feet level, has such a pressure that it flows through the
                        sluices at the rate of over 36 miles an hour. </p>
                    <p>The diagrams below, which I have taken from the "Daily Mail," will better
                        enable your readers to understand this:— </p>
                    <!-- image and notes -->
                    <p>In the opinion of several engineers with whom I have discussed the question,
                        this alone is sufficient reason for "going slow" for the present, although
                        some think the necessity for this work should have been foreseen from the
                        commencement and therefore undertaken earlier. However that may be, the
                        decision is considered a wise one, if there were no other reason to justify
                        it. But there is yet another reason, for some months ago the theory of Mr.
                        Atcherley and Professor Karl Pearson that the stresses are also in a
                        vertical direction as well as horizontal, was propounded in a pamphlet,
                        which, as soon as it came into the hands of the Egyptian authorities set
                        them, "a-thinking." Their consulting engineer was called out to examine and
                        discuss the theory on tho spot, with the result as is known. </p>
                    <p>I have seen some hard things said of the Egyptian authorities as to their
                        action being too sudden, and influenced more by the present condition of
                        land speculation than the question of the stability of the dam. These ideas
                        have found little favor among those who know Egypt,—quite the contrary. It
                        is thought that the country should be congratulated as having a strong and
                        capable Government, who at once took the public into their confidence, and
                        told them the true state of affairs. Nothing could justify the Government in
                        taking the slightest risk on what for Egypt is a most interesting question.
                        If anything were to happen to the dam—of which now there is not the
                        slightest chance—it would mean that, the Blue Nile would in future would
                        have to be spelt Blue Ruin, so fearful would be the consequences of its
                        escape. </p>
                    <p>No doubt this has been a disappointment to several people, who are interested
                        in helping to develop the uncultivated lands of Egypt, and who were rightly
                        expecting that the additional supply of water would soon enable them to do
                        this. Some of these are adversely criticizing the action of the Government,
                        as for the moment they have received a cold douche. But are they justified,
                        in face of all the facts which have been given to the public? If they only
                        have patience they will get all the water they want, and this sooner than is
                        generally anticipated. Land companies, which are started under proper
                        auspices and conditions, will no doubt do a great deal of good for this
                        country; for they not only find the necessary capital and organization which
                        the fellaheen have not got, but they also bring the land into cultivation
                        and a paying condition, with a view to selling it to the natives afterwards,
                        so that eventually the people will own a still further quantity of land than
                        at present. This is all in the right direction and "marking time," which the
                        "dam question" now calls for, can only be for the good of the country, from
                        whatever point of view it is looked at. </p>

                    <p>The effect of issuing £1,250,000 new shares of £5 each will be as follows.
                        Existing shareholders will lend another £5, making a total of £10 advanced
                        by each shareholder on the old and new issues. The new issue put out at 9%.

                        of importance which is imminent in the Egyptian market. A concern of the
                        first magnitude is being talked of in certain City circles, which would own
                        various concessions and have a total capital of £600,000, of which £450,000
                        would be allocated to working capital. It remains to be seen, of course,
                        whether theo nature of the concessions is such as to afford sufficient
                        justification for the expenditure of so large a sum upon them. </p>

                    <p>A regrettable incident, or rather a series of incidents, has taken place at
                        the Polytechnic School at Ghizeh. It appears that last Tuesday a pupil, on
                        being told to sit on a certain bench, objected that there was water on it,
                        and, backed the objection by comments that resulted in his being reported to
                        the head master. </p>
                    <p>It seems that be refused to apologize and was "sent down" for a week,
                        whereupon a number of his fellow students sent in a petition on his behalf.
                        The petition was not granted and his sympathetic friends struck work for a
                        day. This was too much, and the writer of the petition was also "sent down"
                        on Thursday last. </p>
                    <p>Friday was a dies non, and on Saturday the pupils returned in the morning and
                        having arranged a plan of campaign departed in the afternoon, and on to the
                        present have not returned. Only four appear to have declined to join the
                        strike. </p>
                    <p>The situation is not pleasant and great sympathy is felt with Dr. Mackenzie,

                    <p>It is impossible to say what will be the upshot of this movement among the
                        pupils. We are inclined to think that it has been engineered from Cairo

                        New Khedivial Hotel had been elaborately prepared for the occasion. The
                        ball-room was graced by a large portrait of the King of Italy, set up in
                        front of the entrance, surrounded by flowers. Nearly a thousand invitations
                        had been sent out and there was a most brilliant and representative
                        gathering of all the leading members of Alexandrian society. </p>
                    <p>The ball began at 9.30 p.m. and dancing was kept up with great vigour until
                        an early hour this morning. A well-stocked buffet was prepared for the
                        guests and a splendid supper was served at midnight. </p>

                        <p>Operations have at last been started on the Norwegian ship "Congal",
                            which, it will be remembered was sunk in harbour by the Harrison liner
                            "Craftsman'' and has for a long time lain there, causing great
                            inconvenience to the Canal Company. The Constantinople Salvage
                            Association were approached by the owners and insurers of the vessel and
                            two of their salvage steamers have been here, but left again without
                            doing anything, and it appears that they asked £60,00 for raising her.
                            This sum was not accepted. She is insured for £5,000 and is vessel of
                            some thirty years old, so It Is easily understood that the Insurers
                            would have nothing to do with the salving of her at such a cost. The
                            result was that a court case was started, and she was handed over to the
                            Canal Company to do what they wished with her. </p>

                    <p>des contrats.</p>
                    <p>Samedi, le 8 avril 1905.</p>
                    <p>Cotons Disponible.-Il y a eu beaucoup de ralentissement dans la demande et
                        quoique les prix</p>
                    <p>n'offrent que peu de changements, le marché n'en est pas moins en tendance
                        plutôt faible. Les provenances Haute-Egypte de Good Fair et au-dessous sont
                        les seules qui aient joui de quelque faveur et dont la cote a enregistré une
                        petite hausse.</p>
                    <p>Franco-station.-On n'en parle pas. Contrats. Nouvelle récolte. Maintenant que
                        la vieille récolte réactionne, le novembre</p>
                    <p>montre beaucoup de soutien, ce qui ne surprend guère du moment qu'il avait
                        résisté au mouvement de hausse. L'activité pourtant n'y est pas grande.</p>
                    <p>Récolte actuelle. Les haussiers, doutant de la réussite de leur manœuvre sur
                        mai, commencent à vouloir sortir, et c'est cette circons-</p>
                    <p>tance qui a fait baisser les prix et réduit le déport sur juillet à 3/16 de
                        talari. En apparence il y a encore du soutien, mais, en réalité, il y a de
                        la faiblesse et de l'inaction, au point que nous pourrons bien avoir sous
                        peu l'horaire d'eté supprimant les séances de l'après-midi. Beaucoup de
                        courtiers le demandent déjà. Dans la matinée; prix plus haut pour mai tal.

                    <p>Graines de coton</p>
                    <p>Disponible.-La demande est modérée et les cours ne parviennent pas à se
                        relever. Contrats.-Nouvelle récolte. On a fini par accompagner l'affichage
                        du prix du mot "nominal", tant les affaires y sont rares. Acheteurs et
                        vendeurs se montrent réservés.</p>
                    <p>Récolte actuelle.-De temps à autre quelques transactions, mais insuffisantes
                        pour imprimer au marché une animation quelconque. Toutefois, il y a meilleur
                        ton depuis hier, l'influence de la première filière d'avril ayant déjà
                        disparu.</p>
                    <p>Dans la matinée; prix plus haut pour avril P.T. 54-/— à −/− : plus bas pour
                        avril 53 35/40 à —/—.</p>

                    <p>Faute d'arrivages, aucune affaire en disponible.</p>
                    <p>Quant aux contrats, ils continuent à être complètement négligés.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. They are as
                        follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>
                </div>
                <div type="item">
                    <head>Southern Italy</head>
                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                    <head>ROUTE I. SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                    <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to Palermo and
                        down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and Catania. TAORMINA is one of
                        the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station
                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but a few hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting

                        to need comment here. But a list of the principal attractions may not be out
                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman
                        Forum, etc. </p>

                        churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                        outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with the Monastery 3,300 feet above
                        the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St.
                        Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of
                        oaks takes about an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                        view.</p>
                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). -The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest deathaverages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature —warm in winter and | deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and his-torical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>Genoa is the principal port on the Mediter-­ranean, and the first commercial
                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                    <p>MONTREUX is composed of scattered villages partly on the hillside, partly on
                        the late, and is divided into three parts, Le Chatelard, Les Planches, and
                        Veytaux. Many excursions can be made from Montreux; to Vevey by electric

                        surrounding mountains can be obtained, then to Naye, 6,500 feet, from where
                        can be seen the Bernese Alps (Wetterhorn, Eiger, Jungfrau, etc.) Les Avants
                        can be reached from Montreux by road, via Glion, and the fields of narcissus
                        are a lovely sight in early summer.</p>
                    <p>Continuing on by rail, you pass Territet, Villeneuve, Aigle, Bex, St.
                        Maurice, and the come to Martigny.</p>
                    <p>AIGLE, 20 minutes from Montreux is the starting point to the health resorts
                        of Leysin, Diablerets, Chateau d'Oex (for its bracing mountain air cures);
                        Villars (for milk cures, and lovely scenery); Chesieres and Bex (noted for
                        its strong saline waters and grape cures). Near Bex is Les Plans for
                        climatic cure, 3,600 ft., and a centre for mountain excursions.</p>
                    <p>Martigny is the starting place for the Tete Noir and Col-de-Balme routes to
                        Chamonix, one of the most popular Alpine resorts, on account of being within
                        easy reach of the famous Mer-de-Glace Clacier des Bossons. The ascent of
                        Mont Blanc is made from here, and needs usually two days.</p>
                    <p>Champery, situated at the foot of the Dent-du-Midi, is reached by diligence
                        from Monthey. From Martigny the railway goes to Brigue (the terminus of the

                        made. The view of the snow-covered Alps and glaciers obtained from the
                        railway to Gornergrat is really magnificent.</p>
                    <p>Eggshorn is a high mountain resort on the Brigue-Rhone Glacier road, whence
                        the ascent of the Jungfrau is made quite easily. There are also numerous
                        Glacier excursions, notably that to the Aletsch Glacier the largest in
                        Switzerland.</p>

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
