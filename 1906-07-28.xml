                        without hesitation the rfiidial statement of the Natal Government, which was
                        read in the House of Commons yesterday by the Undersecretary for the
                        Colouiee. But they will do do more than this. They will reprobate in the
                        strongest manner the disingenuous attitude of the Ministry towards these
                        slanderous attacks 01 the charaoter of their owo kith and kin. Instead of
                        xialom-ly defending the honour of a little Colony ,which has been threatened
                        with a terrible danger, the British Government has elected to play the part
                        of a cold, self righteous judge. We deplore - the effeot. which the
                        discussion that followed mnst have, upon all men of British blood ' in
                        South' Africa, for what the Minister added, of his own initiates, cm only be
                        understood as implying official esnsare upon the coidnot of one of
                        tbeufficers ol the Natal forces. For the most sensational act of barbarism
                        asoribed to the troops under the command of Colonel Mnokei zie was the
                        foatting off of the head of the arch rebel Bambaata. The sugges tion was
                        that this was done for sheer wantODness, as a piece of ferccions savagery,
                        worthy of the dead man himself. We were old that the head was sent round as
                        a'sort of ghastly trophy, to intimidate the other chiefs into sarrguder.
                        Nothing coaid be farther, from the troth. The ofiioial explanation is per<cb

                        deep gorge, twothoasand feet below the oamp, and it was a matter of urgent
                        importance that tbore t-bonld be no doubt as to his fate. Major Platt, of
                        the Army Medical Corps, was sent with a native escort. He fonDd the body
                        badly decomposed,and when the natives refaseid to cury it to camp, the head
                        was ampnta'e I. it was kept under armedescort in absolate Privacy ; it was
                        only shown to those whoprofessed to know the chief, and when the identity
                        was verified beyond quee tion, it was retarnedto the spot where it htd been
                        foand, and baried with the body. Wherein lies the atrooity What is there in
                        this story which need inspire honor or disgust? T'hesnbjeot is an unpleasant
                        one to dwell upon-like everyting connected with a postmortem—bnt there is
                        absolutely not a shred of reaion why a British Minister should not have
                        expressed his satisfaction that a fool slander had been so entirely
                        disproved. That, however, is not the way of this Government iu dealing with
                        the British Colonies. Their consistent attitude is to be willing to wound,
                        yet afraid to strike. The Colonial Under S« cretaiy, when asked whether the
                        Government had conveyed any comment on the the fcroatment'of Bambata's body,
                        made the amazing statement that he feated "the British Govern-ment were not
                        in the.best position to act" as oensors. And then he went on to say that
                        under the late Administrationthe Khalifa's head had been "most shamefally
                        treated and that he thought it obvious that "sneh. an evil precedent wooU be
                        quoted against ns by the Colony in reply to any remonstrance we might think
                        it necessary to make.* When Mr. Arnold Forster, very properly, pressed him
                        to say whether he imputed any disgraceful aot fo Major Platt, the only
                        answer he could obtain was that the Under Secretary for the-Colonies did not
                        think it ' half so disgraceful as the steps taken in regard to the Mahdi."
                        Frank and open oensore would have been far preferable to this glancing
                        suggestion of condemnation, which. will be hotly resented in Natal.
                        Moreover,the attack on Lord kitchene was. as gratuitous as it was
                        unwarranted. There is no need dr us to justify what was done in the Sondan
                        after the fall of Omdurman. On that oooasion, as in Natal, those in command
                        of the troops took the measares they deemed . most efficacious for
                        convincing tbsir beaten and fanatical enemies that further resistance was
                        useless Then, as now, the sensation-mongers wereluiy with their lies. There
                        were Exactly the same charges as to killing the wonnded. ft was boldly eaid
                        that orders had been issued that no quarter should be given. Lord Kitchener
                        was reviled by the tribe of unthinking sentimentalist! at horns, who hardly
                        concealed their regrets that the British oasdal ties were so email in
                        comparison with tbdsd of the Dervishes, and wrote of the Khalifa's savage
                        tribe men as though they were entitled to the favour and consideration due
                        to a civilised and hnmaue race. </p>

                        the few white men who have fallen into the hands pf these Zola rebels would
                        go far to condone any savage reprisals committed in the heat o f action. It
                        is difficult, however, to write with patience of the-atrocity loving public

                        Egyptian village, but their consciences are sorely hart if the morderers are
                        panished. An English police inspector is stabbed through and through with
                        assegais—it is a regrettable incident in the eyes of the English Radical.

                        <p>UNIONIST DOUBTS.</p>
                        <p>LONDON, July 87..</p>
                        <p>HOUSE OF COMMONS-Mr. Edmund Robertson, Secretary to the Admiralty, said
                            that it was the unanimous opinion of the Board of the Admiralty that the
                            ship-building programme should be reduced as follows: 3 vessels of the
                            Dreadnought type to be constructed instead of 4; 2 ocean-going
                            destroyers instead of 5; 8. submarines instead of 12. By this means a
                            saving of £2,500,000 would be affected.</p>
                        <p>Referting to the forthcoming Hague. Conference, he said that the
                            Government, bearing in mind the resolution already passed in the House
                            in favour of the reduction of armamente, proposed during 1907-8 to lay
                            down two armoured cruisers instead of 4, with the provision that a third
                            would be laid down if the Hague Conference was abortive.</p>
                        <p>This, he said, would be done in order to emphasize the good faith of the
                            Government in the Conference, but it did not, however, exhaust the
                            possible economies. The Lords of the Admiralty recommended reduction
                            which they were unanimously of opinion would not imperil the balance of
                            sea-power. Another faotor in favour of this reduction was, that that
                            progress had not been made with foreign new programmes which the
                            Admiralty anticipated when the estimates were framed a year ago.</p>
                        <p>Unionist speakers doubted whether the Lords of the Admiralty made the
                            reductions of their own freewill and predicted that the Government's
                            dream of international peace wes doomed to an early extinction.</p>
                        <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman said that no one wished, the navy to be weaker
                            but that extravagance does not secure efficiency. (R.)</p>

                        <p>THE TSAR'S POLICY.</p>
                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, July 27.</p>
                        <p>M. Stolypin, in the course of an interview granted to Renter's
                            correspondent, stated that the Tsar has resolved to follow a policy of
                            strong-handed reform. Nothing was further, he said, from his Majesty's
                            wishes than the reaction which had occurred, but the revolutiomaries
                            must be thwarted. M. Stolypin relied on the innate patriotism of the
                            nation. He believed that the Tsar's appeal would result in the
                            extinction or effective repression of anarchical forces. When the
                            Cabinet was complete he would produce an exhaustive programme dealing
                            with the land question. No steps would be taken against the members of
                            the Duma unless they attempted to agitate. the country. The Tsar
                            dissolved the Duma only with the utmost reluctance, when he found that
                            nothing useful was to be expected from it.</p>

                        postponed his departure for England in consequence of orders which he had
                        received from London. We. have made inquiries in official quarters in Cairo,
                        and we are informed that this is quite untrue. The postponement of Mr.
                        Machell's departure was decided upon by himself, and has no espe cial
                        significance. The presumption, which our contemporary makes, that the
                        postponement is due to the probability of further trouble is, we consider,
                        not only unfounded but mischievous. It is exceedingly regrettable that a
                        large portion of the Egyptian Press, both European and vernacular, is unable
                        to maintain a calm and impartial tone, when exceptional and disturbing
                        occurrences take place. The hysteria which is now prevalent in the Press is,
                        of course, due to the Denishwai outrage and the strong measures which have
                        been taken.. To assume from the proposed increase in the strength of the
                        Army of Occupation that serious trouble is inevitable or even likely
                        indicates, however, an unworthy timorousness. If the increase is effected,
                        and we have every reason to believe that it will be, it must be regarded as
                        a protective and demonstrative measure. We do not deny that there is unrest
                        among. the Moslem population of Egypt, in fact we have ourselves remarked
                        upon it, but even in the short space of time which has elapsed since the
                        Danish wai incident greater moderation has been evident in the conversations
                        of those who are wont to talk foudly in public places and, moreover, among
                        those whose opinions are more sincere and who do not ta'k merely for the
                        sake of causing agitation and gaining notoriety. We would be guilty of gross
                        neglect of daty were we to disregard possibilities and scoff at patent
                        indications of fanaticism or disaffection and we must therefore show, as we
                        are now doing, that we are prepared to meet any emergency that night arise.
                        It is an old adage that prevention is better than oure and at the present
                        moment England by her foresight is taking care that no necessity for a care
                        should arise. It is needless, we trust, to assure our readers that the
                        rumours of a more general disturbance which are to be heard occasionally
                        only emanate from the mouths or pens of the mischievons or thoughtless of
                        whom there is a leaven in every country.</p>

                    <head>REFUGEES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>PERSECUTION OF RUSSIAN JEWS.</p>
                    <p>It is one in the natural order of things that the troublous times in Russia
                        should have caused a large exodus of the persecuted Jewish population. The
                        steamers from Odessa and other ports have for many months past brought
                        refugee families to Egypt, and as the troubles are by no means over a large
                        increase in the numbers in the near future is probable.</p>
                    <p>The destitution among these people who have had to flee for their lives is
                        very great, efforts have been made in the past, and will be necessary in the
                        future, in order to feed and clothe them and put them in the way of earning
                        a living during the time they have perforce to remain in exile.</p>
                    <p>A few months ago a committee was formed under the presidency of M. d'Abaza,
                        and we are. glad to record the measures taken accomplished, which has had
                        the active co-operation of Mr. Rudolph, in whose home very many families
                        have been fed and single men housed. Altogether about 150 families, have
                        been assisted, 30 of which have returned to Russia. Many have been sent to
                        Cairo, but much difficulty has been found in finding situations, owing to
                        the men being unable to speak any other language bat Russian or Yiddish.</p>
                    <p>The committee have met twice a week, shoemakers, carpenters and others have
                        been furnished with tools to carry on their trades, and monetary help has
                        been given as far as the limited funds at the disposal of the committee
                        permitted. Some of the mechanics are employed at the cotton spinning.
                        factory and the rice mills at Karmous, and 26 are at work at Mariont, where
                        an English Syndicate has purchased and is developing a large tract of land.
                        The committee is assured that employment will be found there for many more
                        but at present there is no accommodation tor then.</p>
                    <p>Fands being at the present time very low it has been decided to make an
                        effort to increase them, and to appeal to the public to furnish the
                        necessary means for carry on the work of relief. A largely attended meeting
                        of the committee was held on Thursday last, 27 members being present,
                        including the president, M. d'Abazi, M. von Back (Russian) vice-Consul),
                        Baron Emile Menasce and Baron Menasce, MM. Mantachoff, Landauer, Hert-
                        zenstein Margoliach, Radolph, and Danon (Secretary). It was decided to
                        organise two fetes one at the Casino San Stefano, which will probably take
                        the shape of a halland the other at the "French Garden," in the Place des
                        Consul. The details are not yet settled, nor at the dates fixed but
                        probably. the fêtes will be held on a Saturday and Sunday</p>
                    <p>A sub committee was appointed to make necessary arrangements. M. Landauer,
                        manager of the San Stefano Casino, is cooperating in the scheme, which
                        should met with hearty support from all, Jews, Christians, and Mohamedans
                        alike. M, Rudolph, who, it is almost superfluous to say, is doing his utmost
                        to help, speaks in the highest terms of praise of the efforts made by the
                        Russian Consul General on behalf of his distressed countrymen, and the great
                        sympathy shown by him. In a cause like this he should he well supported by
                        all classes in Alexandria, and the coming fêtes secure abundant
                        patronage,</p>
                    <p>The fête held on August 5 on behalf of the refugees, which will be under, the
                        honorary presidency of M. d'Abeza, will be marked by a lottery the first
                        prize in which will be a 51. H.P. motor car which won the Milan San- Remo
                        race. Three 3% Crédit Foncier lottery bonds and three Panama lottery ticke's
                        are also among the prizes.</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) Jerusalem, July 23.1</p>
                    <p>The death occurred on Saturday afternoon, the 21st instant, of the Very
                        Reverend Jacob Saul Eliaschar, Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem and the whole of
                        Palestine, at the advanced age of 93 years. The deceased dignitary held the
                        Office of Chief Rabbi for nearly 14 years, previous to which he occupied for
                        about 36 years the post of president of the Rabbinical Court, or
                        "Beit-Eddin," in this City.</p>
                    <p>The late Chief Rabbi Eliaschar was very popular and enjoyed the fall
                        confi'ence of his people, rich and poor alike, for his upright and sound
                        judgement. He was esteemed by all classes of the population for his patriar-
                        chal bearing and gentle manners.</p>
                    <p>His funeral was largely attended; nearly the whole Jewish population
                        accompanied the Cortège to the Cemetery and as a mark of respect all the
                        Jewish shops were closed during the funeral.</p>

                    <p>The "Stampa" maintains that its disclosures regarding the unsatisfactory
                        condition of the Vatican buildings are absolutely correct. The apartments
                        used by the Pops are especially in danger, because the supporting walls
                        built in the Middle Ages in the lower part of the Vatican have been removed
                        most carelessly. The Pope himself remarked recently to a foreign prelate
                        whom he received in andience, "You see; I have no longer even a chapel, in
                        which I oan keep the moat sacred things." The disolosures made by the
                        "Stampa" ara felt to be accurate, for it was found necessary to carry out
                        very tedious and complicated repairs in the Sistine Chapel in order to
                        protect Michael Angelo's masterpiece from falling into decay, and the Papal
                        gallery of pictures has had to be removed to other quarters for the same
                        reason.</p>

                    <p>The report from Alexandria that the British garrison in Egypt is to be
                        further increased and maintained so until the unrest has passed away has
                        given much satisfaction in service ciroles. It is recognized that a firm
                        policy is required just now, and it is considered a most providential thing
                        that there are yet in the Liberal Administration Ministers who place the
                        interests of the Empire before party. The 4th Battalion Rifle Brigade from
                        Malta, and another battalion from Gibraltar are spoken of as additional
                        forces for Egypt at an early date. It is expected that the 3rd Battalion
                        Coldstream Guards will be sent to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Major D.K.E. Hall, commanding No. 2 Company Army Service Corps, Woolwich, has
                        been noted for employment in Bgypt.</p>
                    <p>Rear Admiral George Le C. Egerton, C.B., has been appointed second in command
                        of the Atlantic Fleet, in saccession to Rear-Admiral Sir A. Berkley Milne,
                        Bart., C.V.O., whose tenure expires on the 25th August.</p>
                    <p>The cruiser Terrible, which is going out to the Far East with reliefs for the
                        China Squadron, and the Australian Sqadron, will proceed by Cape Town,
                        calling at Freetown en route, and will return home by the Suez route.</p>
                    <p>-The appointment of a combatant officer to the command of Military Mounted
                        Police in Egypt will add to the status of that force, which consists of 120
                        of all ranks. Captain H. B. Protheroe-Smith, 21st Empress of India's
                        Lancers, who has been appointed to the command of the squadron, is well
                        known in Egypt, where he served, with the "Omdurman Boys,' and also on the
                        staff, He served with honour under Kitchener in the Nile Expedition, in-.
                        cluding the charge at Omdurman, the South African War, and in the Somaliland
                        Campaign. of 1903-04.</p>
                    <p>The appointment of acting, adjutant to the squadron of Military Mounted
                        Police in Egypt, has been given to Lieutenant Basil A. P. Schreiber, a
                        subaltern of the 20th Hussars, presently stationed at Brighton. Mr.
                        Schreiber served with the 20th in the operations in the Transvaal and Orange
                        River Colony during the closing stages of the South African War (Queen's
                        medal with four clasps) and is well known in Cairo, where he was stationed
                        with the 20th.</p>
                    <p>Much indignation is expressed at the pitiful saving the Army Council will
                        effect by the abolition of the appointment of seconds in command in the
                        cavalry regiments and infantry battalions. It is pointed out that the post
                        of second in command added dignity to the senior major's position, and its
                        duties prepared him for the work of taking over command of a battalion,
                        whilst the savings supposed to be effected in due course by the abolition of
                        the appointment are so pitiful that they cannot be seriously taken into
                        account.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Haldane has his work out out for him in connection with the proposed
                        reduction of the Guards' Brigade by the abolition of the 3rd Battalions of
                        the Coldstreamers and the Scots Guards. Already rumours of threatened
                        resigns. tions by way of protest against any tampering with the Household
                        troops are in the air, and it is well known that the House of Lords, those
                        august fathers, uncles and other relatives of so many of the Guards'
                        officers, will oppose any reduction of the Brigade. There is trouble ahead
                        for Mr. Haldane in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Mejor W. F. Elmslie, Lancashire Fusiliers, has been selected for the
                        appointment of second in command of the 2nd Battalion, Fermoy, and returns
                        from the 3rd Battalion, Pretoria, to take up his duties. He is amongst the
                        last of the cfficers who will be appointed "second in comman 1." Major
                        Elmslie has served with the "Minden Boys" for twenty three years, reaching
                        his present rank in 1900, and. he has the Nile Expedition, including the
                        battle of Khar toum (medal, Egyptian medal with clasp), and the South
                        African War, including the fighting for the relief of Ladysmith-he was badly
                        wounded at Spion Kop-and the campaign generally, to his credit (mentioned in
                        despatches, Queen's medal with four clasps)..</p>

                    <p>Played on Thursday and easily won by Alexandria. The town XI. won the toss
                        and began badly, Cheeseman and Henley getting out in the first half-dozen
                        overs. H. P. Carver and Marsden then made a long stand scoring freely all
                        round the cricket. At 114 Carver was bowled for a freely hit 61 which
                        included fourteen boundary hits and Macaulay and Marsden then added 35 more
                        before the latter was caught at long slip by Cornish for a sound innings.
                        McLean after being dropped off his first ball began to hit with great vigour
                        usefully sup ported by Macaulay. One hundred and eleven runs were added
                        before he was caught and bowled for a fine innings of 74 which included one
                        six and thirteen fours. Foster hit a six before the innings was declared
                        closed, Macaulay carrying his bat ton a freely hit 60 which included a six
                        and nine boundary hits.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of W. E. Peel, who hit hard and well for 44, the Ramleh
                        side fared badly before the bowling of Dawson and Maredep.</p>

                    <p>THE PROPOSED AMALGAMATION SCHEME REJECTED.</p>
                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Egyptian Land and
                        General Trast, Limited, was held on the 19th July, 1906, at Winchester
                        House, Old Broad Street, B.C.. Sir William Haynes Smith (the chairman)
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. W. T. Johns) read the notice convening the meeting.</p>
                    <p>It was moved and seconded that the meeting be adjourned for half an hour or
                        three quarters of an hour, in view of the fact that a meeting of the
                        Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company, Limited, was called for the same
                        time as the meeting of this company, and several shareholders of the trust
                        were also interested in the Delta Company and wished to be present at the
                        meeting. The motion, on being put to the meeting, was lost..</p>
                    <p>The Chairman; Gentlemen, in February las two directors of the Egyptian Dalta
                        Land and Investment Company, Limited, one a member of their London board and
                        one a member of their Egyptian board, acting entirely on their own
                        initiative, proposed to us that our com- pany should amalgamate with their
                        company on the basis of our giving five of our shares, on which 108. has
                        been paid, for one of their fally- paid shares. The board of this company.
                        care- fally considered the position and assets of both companies. They
                        believed that the policy of amalgamation, if carried out on fair terms, had
                        much to recommend it, because it tended to economy in administration and
                        checked the constant competition between land companies, which was leading
                        to inflation of prices. Your board accepted the offer thus spon taneously
                        made to them, and on February 23rd a preliminary contract was signed in
                        Egypt to carry out the arrangement. The London Delta board delayed their
                        decision on the subject, and on April 7th we were informed that it was
                        supposed that the Delta people in Egypt had been so busy with pur- chases
                        and sales they have in hand that they had been unable to make an inspection
                        of and report upon the Egyptian Land Com pany's properties. The Delta Land
                        shares were at this time rising in price. At length, on April 30th, at a
                        meeting of the two boards, the Delta London board finally declined to carry
                        out the arrangement, on the ground that the rise of price in their shares
                        made it useless to suggest the confirmation of the <floatingText>

                        taken. Considerable fueling was aroused among the shareholders in Egypt, and
                        it is under stood that a member of the Delta London board was specially sent
                        'to Egypt in connec tion with the fasion of the companies. Ad vances were
                        subseqaently again made to ns, and another preliminary agreement was en
                        tered into on the basis of six. to one. This is the agreement now brought
                        before tho general meeting. The shares to be given to XJS were to* be part
                        of.tjieir authorised re serve of 50,000 shares. / After the second agreement
                        WAS signed the board of this com pany ascertained that tha Delta Lands Lon
                        don board had in their circular asking con formation of the second agreement
                        also asked their shareholders ta inoreaae their oapital from £250,000 to
                        £'>00,00% or, ip other words, to. double it'Their action appeared to m

                        assets, and the scatter was, therefore, specially brought to the attention
                        of our shareholders and of the Delta board. In their reply to our rem in
                        strance the Delta board states:—(I) That only power to make sach increase
                        WAS being sought; (9) that such increase was to bo made as and when and if
                        required ; and (3) that the immediate issue of any part of it was so doab
                        fill that the price of issue had not even been consiffere/,' and they
                        farther stater! t|iat if tha occasion arore for issaiog, oar shareholders
                        were likely to receive cmsiddrable benefit trom a pro rata distribution of
                        new shares. The board of thia' company are advised by experts well
                        acquainted with Egyptian business thd the mere decision to increase, the
                        capital will be enough to start a selling movement, and that the proposals
                        about the inore>se of capital prej idi oially atfectel the valne of the
                        shares. It is clear that, if their oapital be increased as they propose, the
                        holders ought to be prepared within the specifiel limits to find tin
                        additional oapital wh ch tho Ddta bnrd may from time consider they neet To
                        keep our shares equi valent to their valae any new issue would have to be at
                        least over £ 1 10s per £ I share. D o our ahareho'ders desire to take up
                        this possible liability which it is proposed should be brought into
                        operation at the d:screti en of the Delta hoard? The reason why your board
                        agreed to the first proposals for amalgamation was beeause th?y%el:eved the
                        De'ta Linds had in past yea's purchased lands on exceptionally favourable
                        terms—lands which had now become for aajle. Their shareholders had waited
                        without dividends, while the shares to be given <cb n="3"/>wero to rank with
                        the original shares. Any increa a of capital certainly alters,the proportion
                        held at the date of the last agreement of the shares then authorised to the
                        existing assets, and it was on thie proportion your board based their
                        consent to the arrangement. Again, is it probable thatnew capital can be
                        emplo yed now by a land company in Egypt, in the face of the prevailing
                        Competition, to the ffame advantage as when the Delta Lands purchased some
                        years ago the Meadi Lands,which ^orm one of their principal assets ? Even if
                        it is probable, do our shareholders desire to increase or double their
                        investments'in Egypt ? The question whether the increase of oapital does or
                        do not materially prejudice the valne of the share! to be given for oar
                        assets is onewhich yon have to deoide for yourselves and, as our
                        shareholders include many experienced men «rf basiu'essin Egypt, no doabt an
                        accurate judgment will be given. Although the board are quite prepared, for
                        the reasons before stated, to agree to' amalgamation on fair term", they are
                        in no dernbt as to the success of yonr company. The assets are all good, aud
                        are estimated, on a conservative basis, as being worth considerably more
                        than the paid-np oapital, after paying all liabilities. While thes9 matters
                        have been pending between the two companies two instalments of purchase
                        money fjr lands became doe, -on June 30tb and Jaly 1st, and it was provided
                        in the agreement that these should be paid in Egypt by the Delta Lands, they
                        charging interest until it was decided whether the proposed amalgamation was
                        to be approved. If the agreement is confirmed no point arises on this ; but
                        if it is not confirmed the amonUt so disbnrsed will be returned, with the
                        stipulated interest. There are no other liabilities of importance. The half
                        rof the capital of the company which has 'Been called ap has been well
                        employed, and the initial expenses of the company were less thin nsaaLfOne
                        of our assets is tho interest of the company in the Shorbal Estate, at
                        A'oxaodria. ft is a large bail ling estate, well situated and of ex
                        ceptional and increasing valae, as being almost the only remaining laud
                        available for building purposes within the quadrilateral area which forms
                        Alexandria. The board declined an offer for this proparty, giving a profit
                        of over £30,000 ; bat the company believe that con- si ferfbly largor
                        profits can bo made if this property be olrafnlly realised. The resolutions
                        are now snbmitted to the meeting. </p>

                    <p>Mr Wrightson asked if the oh'airman coold give the shareholders an

                    <p>The Chairman said he estimated the value of the assets, after paying all the

                    <p>Mr. Cadman Jones moved the rejection of the proposals submitted because, in

                    <p>Mr. A. P. Mack said he wishe I, in fairness to the Delta Company, to state
                        that when he WAS in Cairo at the end of May he met one of the directors of
                        that company, who did mention that there was a probability of an increase of
                        capital being made. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Howard asked if the shareholders might Ukalt that the directors as a body
                        did not advise the carrying ont of the amalgamation. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Wrightson said it seemed to him that the assets showed a share valne of
                        13s. a share, and if they were to be 'given shares on the basis of 6 to
                        Lthey ought to receive an exchange of approximately 78s. </p>
                    <p>Grookshauk Pasha said he wished to give a little note of warning to the
                        shareholders. Certain things had arisen in Egypt lately wl/ch had con aid
                        drab'y aHered the state of affairs there, and it was nopafc unlikely that
                        they would see the market very low this winter. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman, replying to Mr,./Howard, said the directors had naturally
                        endeavoured to obtain the opinion of those who were well arquaintod with
                        Egyptian business with regard to the proposed anoalgamation. A member of a
                        firm doing a large business in Cairo, Alexandria and London stated that the
                        information from Cairo was that the idea of the Delta C jtupany's inorease
                        of oapital was not welcomed by shareholders, and from Alexandria that the
                        cironlar about the new issae had prodaced a bad impression among
                        shareholders. Taking that view the agreement was one which the directors did
                        not feel justified in pressing on the shareholders. </p>

                    <p>Mrs. Mallon Tylqr^of 11. Albion street, Rugeley, Staffs., Eiglahd, says:—
                        ''Prom childhood I have had à dney and bladder tronble, bat einev my
                        marriage (over seven years ago) I have suffered more than I can tell yon.
                        Water Collected in my limbs and body, making me a dreadful 6ize. I became so
                        big that I had to go sideways up and down stairs ; I musVhxve weighed over
                        18st. I used to be afraid that if the water reached my heard I abonld be
                        gone. </p>
                    <p>i also- suffered from violent catting pains in the back and loins ; I. would
                        bi nearly blind with pains in the head, and my heart seemed as though it
                        would leap into my in oath. I was a walking misery. </p>
                    <p>"My husband add mother and father were in a terrible way about me; mother
                        said she was Bure I had kiabeY7lifteas6. I have ssen my neighbours crying
                        over my c^ddition, and they have said they hoped I would never have any more
                        children. </p>
                    <p>"The doctor described my illness as dropsy, but his medioin'e did me no
                        lasting good. </p>
                    <p>"Of Doan's Bickache Kidoey Pills, however, I cannot speak too highly ; they
                        have made me a different woman, and if every married woman knew what a
                        blessing these pills are, they would never be withoat them. I have told the
                        doctor straight ont that I owe my life to Doan's Bickache Kidney Pills. </p>
                    <p>"After I had used Doan's Pills a few days, the natural aotion of the kidneys
                        and bladder was restored, and the swellings gradnally went down. What is
                        more, since using the pills 1 have never suffered as I nsed to from the
                        terrible backache?, pains in the bead, or heart tronble. i </p>

                    <head>AMALGAMATION PROPOSALS PROVISIONALLY AGREED TO.</head>
                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company Ltd., was held on the 19th July at Winchester House, Old
                        Broad-street, E.C., Sir An k'and ^Colvin, K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G.,-C.I.E. (the
                        Chairman of the company), presiding, f The Secretary (Mr. P. J. Horne)
                        having read the notice convening the meeting, </p>
                    <p>The Chairman said - Yon will doubtle take as read the okonlar sent out by the
                        Board explaining the ohjeots of this meeting. These objects comprise, as yon
                        will have gathered— firstly, the acquisition by this company of the Egyptian
                        Land and General Trust, Ltd , atid, secondly; alterations in the memorandum:
                        and articles of association of our company. Owing to a difficulty which has
                        arisen since the issce to yon-of the notice of this meeting in regard to the
                        fusion of this company with the'Egyptian Land and General Toast, Ltd., it
                        will he cotwe nient to pass first to the resolutions which are not affected
                        thereby—namely, Nos 1, 2/3, 4. 5, 6/7, 8 apd 9. It is the case that
                        resolution No. </p>
                    <p>V fur the extension of our sphere of operations, is partly due tp the
                        proposed absorption of the Egyptian Land and General Trast, Ltd., bemuse no
                        suoh restrictions as we are bound by SJ imposed upon that company. But we
                        have every reason to believe that there are good opsoings for basiness in
                        the Soudan and parts of Egypt from which we are now excluded by our
                        memorandum and articles of association; and though, if the amalgamation
                        referred to be not oarried through, the primary necessity for the alteration
                        disappears, yet this extension of oar sphere , of operations most, before
                        long, come, and the present would appear to be as good an opportunity as
                        any. of dealing with it. Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are desirable alterations
                        owing to the fact that the Delta Light Railways are no longer shareholders,
                        and in consequenoa should no longer have control. In regard to No. 9 we
                        regard it as a safe precaution to raise the minimum number of directors
                        required to form a quorum at a Bjard meeting to two. Directors'
                        Remuneration. </p>
                    <p>I now go back to No. 7 on the subject of the remuneration of the directors.
                        The change in the directors' fees is,a matter which we wished in any case to
                        put before yon. I must remind yoa that this company was originally regarded
                        as likely to be a small affair, an cffihoot of the railways, and accordingly
                        fees and salaries attached to it were fixed proportionately low. Bat it was
                        farther provided that the directors should receive for division amongst
                        themselves 5 per oent of the profits *in any one year after 5 per oent had
                        been paid to th^shareholders. </p>
                    <p>It is. perhaps as well that oooasion has not yet arisen for such boons to ba
                        claimed. An estimate of the accrued profits may be as safely calculated on.
                        the present market price of oar shares as upon any other basis, and this
                        means that as these profits are realised there will probably be
                        considerables00*8 for division. Whatever might be the pecuniary advantages
                        to the Board, they prefer proposing to the share- fhddera that the feei be
                        fixed at what they believe a reasonable and equitable sum, whether as
                        regards the shareh ddera. or directors. 'The fees are at present £IGO to the
                        Chairman and £[() to each direotor, with the prospect of the boons referred
                        to, which it is now proposed that they shoald definitely abandon. In my
                        view, the proposed alterations which I have just enumerated are all
                        desirab'e, whether the amalgamation with the Egyptian Land and General
                        Trm-t, Ltd., is sanctioned oris not. shall be happy to answer any questiona
                        in regard to them, so far as it is in my power, And I will proceed to the
                        consideration of the remaining resolutions which depend opon such
                        amalgamation. The general meeting of the Egyptian Land and General Trast.
                        for the con sideratiOn of the fusion of their company with ,ours is fixed
                        for the same time as the one we \re now holding, BO each is at the
                        disadvantage of not knowing the views held or the decision arrived at or
                        likely to be arrived at of the other. The negotiations in connection with
                        the amalgamation commented in E/ypt so far back as February last, when
                        certain diieotors of the two companies met in Egypt 1 need not enter </p>
                    <p>pon the earlier d.ffi mlties connected with these negotiation0, for they do
                        not bear upon the point now at issue ; but it is neciseary foi roe to
                        explaiu a difficulty created by Egyptian Land and General Trust since
                        notices of this meeting were sent to you, andwhich may affect the whole
                        position. To thirwd the secretary will read to-yoa the circular issued by
                        the Egyptian Land and GeneraUrrnst, Lttfi, on the 6th July,' and our reply
                        to(a jetterj/o the secretaries covering such circular dated </p>

                    <p>The other Company's Circular. </p>
                    <p>The Secretary then read the following com mwioation-.—"Egyptian Land and

                        has been ascertained that the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company,

                    <p>The Secretary (reading): * 9tl^July, 1906. Messrs. Mack and Palmer,
                        Fecretaries, Egyptian Laud and General Trust, Ltd, 68 to .74, Palmerston
                        House, E C. Dear Sirs,—I received with your assistant secretary's letter of
                        the 6th instant oopies of circular - of the same date addressed to the
                        proprietors of your company reference to the proposed- increase of this
                        company's capital. My direotors cannot but regret tha*t they were not
                        afforded an opportunity of eincidating this subject before the issue by
                        your'oompany of a oiroular which may well cause an erroneous impression of
                        their intentions. Iu this company's oircnlar of the 29th June it was briefly
                        stated thet it was considered desirable to increase this company's capital
                        to £*'00,000, but it was at any rate <cb n="3"/> amalgamation, and the
                        advantages or dis-advantages of any such /arrangement as an inorease of
                        capital would he-shared all alike. Thei^nnmerical strength in shares would
                        he as one to six of our present shareholders, and we might have reasouab'y
                        expeoted them Ao feel safe in accepting the deoision of so large a majority,
                        and of feeling assured that the Jhard of this-company would only exercise
                        the powers conferred upon them in so far aif they belisve that the interests
                        of the company and. therefore, of the shareholders of the Egyptian Land and
                        General Trast, Ltd., would be ad- vancedlhereby. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman s Proposal. Lv The position being a </p>
                    <p>The position being as escribed to yoa, my proposal to you is that unless the
                        shareholders of the Egyptian Land and General TrasMje found to have decided
                        upon the amalgamation at their meeting now being hold, and on the terms
                        arranged,such amalgamation be no longer considered by this company. If jfou
                        are pleased to accept thia suggestion, I ask you to authorise me to aot in
                        aocirdance therewith in reference to resolution No. 11, and I will now refer
                        to the preceding resolution No. 10, whioh the only one remaining. Had it not
                        been for the proposed amalgamation with the Egyptian Land and General Trust,
                        Ltd., we probably shoulduot have asked yoq * so soon to authorise ns to take
                        power to increase our apital, and certainly should not have done so fpr so
                        large an amount. I have explained to yon that no immediate fresh issue of
                        capital </p>
                    <p>is contemplated, and under tbe^Jiresent conditions of doubt as to whether an
                        amalgamation will or will not take place, I propose to postpone this
                        question of an inorease to our capital until our next meetiog. In the event
                        of an amalgamation the same inorease will be proposed to yon as in the
                        resolntion which* we are considering, but otherwise power will be sought to
                        provide for an addition of £100,000 only, in view of possible, though not
                        probable, </p>
                    <p>known to Mr. Mack, one of yoar direotors, agencies in oar present sphere of
                        operations,and </p>
                    <p>that paly power to make snoh inorease was being sought; f2) th* t each
                        increase was to be made as and when and if required ; and (3) that the
                        immediate issue of any part of it was so doubtful that the price of issue
                        had not even been considered. The need for the provision for increasing this
                        company's capital is created (l)hythefaot that the proposed acquisition of
                        your company's a9iets will absorb the ba- lame at present available, and (2)
                        by the proposed extension of its sphere of operation'. The authority now
                        soaght is to provide for this possible want, and it appears to my di-rectors
                        that, if it arises, your shareholders are likely to receivj considerable
                        beuefit from pro rata distribution of new shares, and that as they will only
                        form about one-seventh of the whole they may with confidence accept the
                        decision arrived at bythe larger body—namely, our present shareholders—as to
                        the necessity of making the provision proposed. I may ex plain that whatever
                        inorease be made to this company's capital yoar shareholders and oars would
                        be equally affeoted in every way. They farther understood from General
                        Hallowes, a direotor of this company, who recently visited Cairo in
                        connection with the fasion of our two companies, that the idea of increasing
                        this company's capital WAS then mentioned in the presence of Messrs. Mack,
                        Lonsdorfer, Nungo- vich Bey and othe-s. and was received by them-with
                        favour.—Yours faithfully, (Signed} F. J. Horne, Secretary." </p>
                    <p>The Charman : I will now explain that the propo al for the acquisition of the
                        Egyptian Land and General Trust necessarily, carried wifh it one ter power
                        to increase this company's capital. Sach acquisition involved thepaymefit to
                        theEgyptian Land and General Trast of 33,3'4 shares, and 4he advance »to
                        them of £55,000 to meet their liabilities at the 30th June lastion certain
                        lands, and would thus more than absorb the balance of our company's
                        available capital. A a a consequence, and in view, of payments to become doe
                        for properties acquired, and of the proposed extension of the sphere of our
                        operations, we deemed it advisable totakepower to increaseonrcapital
                        to£500,000. Beyond taking this power. I can unhesitatingly affirm that no
                        programme as to ivsae immediate or otherwise had beeu conridered, and as to
                        any date or price of issue of any of this fresh capita', 1 can only say that
                        there details have never beeu fixed, and that the circular just read to you
                        ascribes to us intentions which are fir bejond ns. Our intention, as the
                        oiroular dearly expresses it, was simply to take power to issue capital at
                        such futare time as, in oar opinion, might oall for a fresh issue. The power
                        asked for of raising fresh capital and of a pro posal^ to raise fresh-
                        oapital at an early date are absolutely distinct matters. As at present
                        advised we do not propose to make an issne within the next twelve months,
                        and before making any issue we intend to call a meeting of oar shareholders
                        to lay before them the objects for which the issue is proposed, and take
                        their viows as to the cxpendiency of the issue. The biggest issue we have
                        ever made was £100,000, and it would be unreasonable to suppose that we
                        contemplated issuing a quarter of a million, ithir at once or at any one
                        time. 8uoh, how over, seems to have been the opinion created by the oircnlar
                        in question, and on which the di-rectors of that company have withdrawn, as
                        it Feems to os preoipitately, their recommendation to the Amalgamation of
                        the two companies. Fiom what I have said, it follows that, as and when any
                        fresh istue of our capital was to be made, the shareholders of the Egyptian
                        Land and General Trust would got the benefit of such further issue or issue*
                        equally with our present existing shareholders. The former gentlemen by
                        having acqiffred fehare3 in our company would obtain thb right of
                        subscribing for their proportion, or, bn to other hand, the shares were
                        offered I th the public Ihey would get tin benefityof the proceeds there,
                        The interests of tho /existing shaieholders of our compai y and of those of
                        the Egyptian </p>
                    <p>Land and General Trast, Ltd., would be </p>

                        have been hitherto exoladed, but which will now be opened to ns. </p>
                    <p>Mr. H. P. Singer asked if the Chairman coold give any information as to the
                        reason why the Delta Light Rai'.ways had oeased to be shareholders in the
                        company. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman replied that as long as the Railway Company were shareho'ders it
                        was difficult for this company, with any chanoe of success, to apply to, the
                        Con ft to obtain a modification of the memorandum of assoo:ation necessary
                        to enlarge their sphere of operations. The Railway Company, therefore,'
                        decided, under legal advice, to dispose of its holding, partly on that
                        account, but also o^the ground that the company bad grown and changed into.
                        much larger conoern than was originally designed. It was intended originally
                        to parchsse land OD the line of railway in coarse con- 8traotion and to be
                        constraoted, bat the'edm- pany had gone beyond this and the direotors of the
                        railway came to the conolosion ^hat it was not stfiotly within their powers
                        to be asso-ciated with the Land Company uoder its filtered conditions. They,
                        therefore, decided to withdraw from their connection with the company. and
                        sold their shares in it. The Railway Company had.certainly not in any way
                        lost faith the concern, and had exhibited consideiabh^ objection-to onttiog
                        the connection. f </p>
                    <p>Tho Resolutions. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman then proposed the following resolutions, which ware duly
                        seconded by Major Li Breton and Major General Hallowes, and unanimously
                        agreed to, namely :—That the memorandum and artic'.es'of association be
