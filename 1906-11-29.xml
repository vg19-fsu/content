                    <head>THE NATIVE PRESS.</head>
                    <p>We, have frequently criticised the political view* of the Nationalist Press,
                        and, we believe, in a tone marked by moderation and an absence of personal
                        warmth. We hare, whih differing from them in all general question*, at times
                        recognised that they had a certaii justification for their criticisms of
                        details oi governmental administration. The persons attacks often made on
                        British official* in theii column* do not appear to call for noleni
                        expressions of resentment or annoyance. The difference in ideas, in habits,
                        in training, and modea uf thought between them and their native critics are
                        au profound that uii*ur«. standings are inevitable, and we outsider tlu'.

                        attacked with the moat vulgar personal abuse, we feel a disgust which
                        require* expression. A* an instance what we mean we should like to cite an
                        article entitled 'The Fehmy Excursion, " which appeared in the "Minbar'' of
                        the 21st insL This artiete, which, we shall not advertise unnecessarily by
                        quoting verbatim, contains an eatremely uogrntle- manty reference to tbe
                        Prime Minister's ooo- tiluUonal delicacy, sod is concluded by an ode not
                        over-remarkable for good taste We cannot understand how writers wbo adopt a
                        loftily patriotic tone in their literary pr. ductiona can descend to the
                        extraordinary ungenUemanlineas of attacks of this character a man whose old
                        age and bUmeleas personal character should have been sufficient, had his
                        position in the State failed, to guard him from personal insult. But perhaps
                        there is no possibility of checking the resurgence, in the moat patriotic
                        Egyptians, of an almost barbaric coarseness in abuae, though it range that
                        the editors of "Al Minbar1 should have allowed their journal to coatein a
                        passage which no person of gentlemanly instincts could have written. Surely
                        the Nationalist party does not gain in dignity from these displays of
                        personal spite which, so far from alarming the foreign observer, merely
                        cause him to (hake his head at their bad teste and wonder whether there ia
                        any truth in the proverb, "II Maori yekhaf wa ma yekhtishish." (The Egyptian

                    <head>THE PORTE AND THE GREEK PATRIARCHATE.</head>
                    <p>During the last few weeks the Greek Patriarchate ha* been making preparations
                        to hold an (Ecumenical Council of the Orthodox Church in Constantinople, and
                        invitations to send representatives have been addreated to the Churches in
                        Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere. The project has, the •'Time*' Command nopie
                        apindent itatea, now (alien through in consequence of the opposition of the
                        Porte. One of the objects uf bolding the —wii was to consider the question
                        of the Bulgarian schism, and there can be little doubt that the Greek
                        ecclesiastic* intended to try to induce their fellow-Churchmen to adopt an
                        extreme anti- Bulgarian attitude. Tbi* would have been embarrassing to th8
                        Turkish Government, which, in any case, had no desire to see the council
                        assemble. The Grand Vixior, therefore, took steps which have mode it
                        imposuibie for the council to be held.</p>
                    <p>From this and other incidents it is thought that the Porte is beginning to
                        lose patience with the Patriarchate. The support which the Greek Bishops of
                        Macedonia cootinue to give the Greek bands, and which it now the greatest
                        obstacle in the way of the restoration of tranquillity,has been too
                        pronounced for the Turks to tolerate it, and the action of the Synod in
                        electing as one of its members the Metropolitan of Grevena, who is accused
                        by the Porte of complicity in the outrages of thg bands, ha* given especial
                        offence to the Grand Vixier. It is by no means impossible that the effect of
                        all this may bate produce s change the Turkish attitude towards the Bulga-
                        ,n Exarchate. "Indeed," says the correspondent, "I hear that the .Exarch may
                        be allowed to act upon the rights which were loog ago conferred upon him by
                        Imperial firman, but which he has hitherto been preen ted from enjoying. It
                        is possible that some arrangement of this sort was made at the interview
                        which Nejib Melhame had with Prince Ferdinand in the autumn. Nothing would
                        contribute more effectively to improvement than such a change of attitude of
                        the Po^te towards the Bulgarian national Church "A now believed to be
                        imminent."</p>
                    <p>'Although the idea of holding sn (Ecumeni- cal Council has proved abortive,
                        it is not without interest to note that there was a desire on the part of
                        some Greek prelate* to raise the question of s union of the Orthodox and
                        Anglican Churches. English clerical tourists bo have visited Constantinople
                        and have taken the opportunity to pay their respects to the Greek Patriarch
                        and other ecclesiastical dignitaries ha vecontrived to give the impression
                        hat there exists a strong feeling in England in favour o' this somewhat
                        chimerical project. Naturally enough, Greek Churchmen would hare been glad
                        to try to exploit this feeling forthe benefit of the Greek cause in
                        Macedonia</p>

                    <p>IMPROVEMENTS AND PROGRESS.</p>
                    <p>Helonan is forging ahead this season; and when the Helonan Improvements Co.
                        is in being we may expect to see still farther changes and improvements in
                        this delightful spot. The wonderful alterations in the station of Bab-el
                        Lonk and train service are already being highly appreciated, and the
                        transformation of that dusty little terminus of the Dalta Light Railway Co.
                        reflects great credit on those who have had to do with it. The entire
                        station has been re-decorated and re-arranged. The Khedivial sleon with its
                        private entrance ard ladies' room is now a handsomely furnished suite, and
                        the ladies' rooms, both first and second classe, are furnished with every
                        conve nience and in the best of taste. The rolling stock now includes
                        handeome corridor carriages of Belgian construction, fitted with electric
                        light and wonderfully essy action, all the more wonderful when one remembers
                        the jolting and baking of the old cars.</p>
                    <p>Many changes are observable in Helonan itself. Varions of the main roads,
                        have been macadam zed and structural alterations and additions have been
                        made at that enormous Sanatorium, "Al Hayat." The little English Church,
                        open last Sunday for the first time this season, now bosats a new flooring
                        of handsome tile. The Grand Hote has been freshly painted, and shows up
                        bravely with its white surroundings. New steam heating apparatus. has been
                        supplied by the Nungovich Co, to all the cabins of the Bath; and an
                        efficient staff of Begi-h trained nurses of both sexes have arrived from
                        Harrogate to carry on the work of massage. Gffing is in fall progress, Mr.
                        Horace Talford, the professional, being already installed at the Grand. The
                        tennis courts at the Tewfik Palace Hotel are also in good working order; and
                        a good staff of riding horses are also at the disposal of the guests at the
                        latter hotel. The Hotel des Bains opens this week; and already there is a
                        very fair collection of visitors in the others. Dr Hobson is back again at

                    <p>The attention of passers-by was drawn by the loud screams of the people in

                    <p>Mr. Dillon (Mayo, E) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether
                        his official information still showed that Egypt is in a. dangerons and
                        distorted condition, and affect-. ed by a wave of fanaticism; and, if so,
                        whether he would see that tourists proposing to spend the winter in that
                        country were warned of the danger they might incur.</p>
                    <p>Sir E Grey.-The situation in Egypt is not now giving rise to special anxiety,
                        and there is no reason, and 1 trust will be none, to discourage people who
                        wish to travel from doing so. (Hear, heat).</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon asked whether the attention of the right hon. gentleman had been
                        drawn to the remarkable fact that fanaticism in Egypt. disappeared when the
                        tourist season commenc ed, and if that did not give him much food for

                    <p>Sir B. Grey-I cannot say that it gives me mach food for refl-ction. but I do

                    <p>Mr. Dillon (N. Mayo, Eaat) asked the Poreign Secretary why a fall report of
                        the evidence at the trial of the Denishwai prisoners and of everything that
                        took place in connec tion with that trial had not been supplied to the House

                    <p>Sir E. Grey-The report of the evidence at the trial is not official, but only
                        a summary which was not read over to the witnessss or controlled by the
                        Court. It is substantially the same as the report of the evidence at the
                        preliminary inquiry which has been presented to Parliament, except in some
                        unimportant details. It was not considered necessary to pablish both
                        accounts, and as the account of the evidence given at the preliminary
                        inquiry was regarded as the more accurate of the two, it was decided that it
                        should be published.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon.-Was the right hon. gentleman's attention drawn to the fact that
                        in the report of the procès verbal the defence was not represented, that
                        there was no possibility of any cross-examination of the witnesses, and that
                        that was not the report promised 1 Sir B. Grey-All I promised was the
                        official report, which has been laid.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon.-What the right hon. gentleman promised was the report of the

                    <p>Sir Edward Grey-His Majesty's Govern ment are, of course, not responsible for
                        the regulations of the Suez Canal Company. I am informed that steamers
                        carrying explo sives are not prohibited from passing through the Suez Canal,
                        but that the company reserves the right to take such precautions as are
                        usual in all ports. The authorities take no action unless their attention is
                        drawn to a particular ship as having explosives in her eargo.</p>
                    <p>Such vessels may be berthed at special pointe, and when under transit must
                        fly a special signal, both by day and by night, similar to that shown by

                        source during the navigation of the canal, and the officials have full

                    <p>Sir B. Gry-It is regretted tha Yacoub Artin Pasha bas considered it necessary
                        to resign. But I cannot admit that he has any grievance against the Ezyptian
                        Government. The appointment of Zagloul Bey as Minister of Public Instruction

                        qualifications for the post are not unlike those which have more than once
                        proved eminently satisfactory in the case of Ministers of Education in this
                        country, who have seldom, if ever, been trained in the Department.</p>

                    <head>DEAN BUTCHER'S DEPARTURE.</head>
                    <p>MEETING AT BRITISH AGENCY.</p>
                    <p>At 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon &amp; meeting was held at HB.M's. Agency
                        with Lord Cromer, supported by the American Consul General, in the chair.
                        The object of the meeting was to disocas the presentation of a testimonial
                        to Dean Butoher on his retirement, and we need not say that the British and
                        American colonies were very largely represented.</p>
                    <p>The proceedings were opened by Lord Cromer, who addressed the meeting as
                        follows: Ladies and Gentlemen,-You all know why we are assembled here this
                        afternoon. The everrolling stream of time has at last brought na to the
                        moment when we must regretfully part from the true friend whom many of us
                        have known for so long. The very high regard and esteem which I entertain
                        for Dean Batcher, my long and intimate personal friendship with
                        him-extending over more than a quarter of a centary-the fact that his
                        departure Break one of the very few remaining links which bind me to the
                        B/yotas it was when I first came into this country-all these con-
                        siderations, and a thousand other memories, some of joy and some of great
                        sorrow, which crowd upon my mind, render it very difficult for me to express
                        to you adequately what I feel on the present occasion. My remarks,
                        therefore, will be very brief. I wieb, however, to say that Dean Butcher has
                        always seemed to me the ideal of a Christian gentleman and of a pastor of
                        the Charch of England. Paithful in all things to the duties and obligations
                        imposed on him by his high mission, unsparing of himselt, wide and tolerant
                        in his views on Church matters, charitable in the most true and Scriptural
                        acceptation of that term, ever ready to console and succour the desolate and
                        oppressed-Dean Batcher has, year by year, week by week, and I might almost
                        say day by day, endeavored, both by precept and example, to lift us above
                        the petty cares and annoyances of our daily life, and to instil into us our
                        duty towards God and our daty towards our neighbour. And let me remind you,
                        gentlemer,-leav ing alone more sacred subjects, on which I dare not
                        dwell,-thst our neighbours in this country consist for the most part of
                        those who are of a different race and oreed to ourselves. I have good reason
                        for knowing that the respect and esteem in which Dean Butcher is held
                        extends to a circle far beyond the Anglican community, and that it is thared
                        by the neighbours of whom I speak, to a greater extent than possibly the
                        Dean, in his great modesty, himselt recognizes. I firmly believe that Dean.
                        Butcher's teaching and example have not been without effect. His influence
                        in this country has been wholly for good. He has never been in any way
                        aracciated with missionary effort; but he has constantly endeavoured to make
                        those of his congregation who occupy reaponsible positions in this country,
                        and on whose conduct the welfare of the population so largely depends,
                        realize how they should live, and how they should die, as Christians; and he
                        has never failed to impress upon them that in the exercise of their duties
                        the Christian moral code should be their constant guide. I need say no more,
                        except that I am convinced that Dean Butcher and the lady who has been his
                        helpmate, and who has so ably seconded! him in his work, will carry away
                        with them, in their retirement, the esteem and aff-otion of everyone in this
                        country with whom they have been brought in contact. I trust that many years
                        of health and usefulness still lie before them. I beg to move that a
                        subscription list be opened with a view to presenting a testimonial to Dean
                        Butcher on the occasion of his approaching departure from Egypt. I should
                        add that the Governor of the National Bank of Egypt has kindly consented to
                        receive the subscriptions, or they may be sent to Mr. Da Boulay, who has
                        consented to act as secretary and treasurer to the fand. I should also add
                        that in my opinion the presentation should take the form of a purse of gold
                        to be disposed of as the Dean thinks fit.</p>
                    <p>The Hor. L M. Iddings then addressed] the meeting. He said that he was glad
                        to echo Lord Cromer's words and to support the proposal for which he had
                        pleade!. Dean Butcher's virtues had already been praised; he endorsed all
                        that had been said of them, and added that to them were ad led the graces of
                        homoer and learning. The practice of the American church in foreign lands
                        had always been to combine whenever possible with the English church in one
                        congregation. This had been justified by results. When he came to Cairo he
                        had been delighted to find that All Saints' Church was an ideal church where
                        the two congregations might meet. He knew that the American congregation
                        here was very small, but as their representative he could Fay that they
                        agreed with every word that had been said as to Dean Batcher. It gave him
                        great pleasure to second the motion. The motion that a testimonial be
                        presented to Dean Buteber in recognition of his long and devoted services
                        was then put to the meeting and unanimously voted.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer again addressed the meeting. He stated that it would be indeed
                        difficult to choose a successor to Dean Butcher, but that the community
                        required a man who should resembl his predecessor as far as possible. He
                        would like to point out that the stipend of the chaplain of the British
                        Church in Cairo was raised entirely from the voluntary contributions of
                        residents and visitors. It amonnted to £450, and the sum of £250 was paid in
                        addition for the services of a carate. This was! not a large sum, and as the
                        Church Committee had decided to gadt Dean Butcher a pension of £100 a year
                        from the Church fands, the stipend of his successor would not exceed £40 if
                        the contributions of the community emained at the present level. Then there
                            <cb n="5"/> was the question of the appointment of a suocessor. He
                        believed that this was in part at least a matter for the congregation to
                        decide, working of course with the ecclesiastic al anthorities of the
                        English Church. He intended to communicate with the Archbishop of Canterbary
                        on the subject, expressing his views as to the chaplain they required and
                        asking him to find them anch a man. He would wait for a fortnight before
                        sending the letter so that any member of the congregation. who had not been
                        present at the meeting and had any suggestions to offer could commauicate
                        with him on the subject, This be thought would be the best coarse to follow
                        under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Mr Harrison remarked that wisdom did not usually attend a moltitude of
                        enansellors, and spesking for the charch committee he considered that the
                        congregation could not do better than entrust the matter to the Archbishop
                        of Canterbury and Lord Cromer. This seemed to bim an ideal arrangement.</p>
                    <p>The meeting closed at 4.50 p.m., when large number of those who had been
                        present affixed their names to the list of subscribers. The sum of £548 has
                        already been sab- Boribed.</p>

                    <p>A CHILDREN'S OPERA COMPANY.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR THEATRICAL CORRESPONDENT.) </p>
                    <p>I owe the Khedivial Theatre all gratituds in that they repeated "Manon" and
                        left me free to go to the Abbas to see what the children's company was like.
                        It was quite delicious and I give the complete répertoire, so that others
                        may go and, I think, enjoy it as 1 did:-"Barbier de Seville," Bisir d'Amore"
                        (a most charming light Dzatti), "Educande di Sorrento," "Crispino e
                        Commare," "La Fille da Tambour Major," and "Carmen." "La Sonnam bula" was
                        done last night, and "Pipelé" to night. I don't know "Pipelé" or M. Ferrari,
                        the composer, bat it was not unlike the "Elisir d'A more"-good,ligh' music
                        and not commonplace or exaggerated. First of all, M. Guerra, the director of
                        the company and orchestra, plays the pisno and conducte. He deserves a
                        severe fate; he plays that piano and exaggerates those instraments as if he
                        was Ro-enthal in a concert hall; he seems to lose right of the fact that he
                        is playing for children; it might (as) conducting) be Mancinelli trying his
                        best to catch up his half bar of arrear in the pilgrims' march, or Lamoureux
                        paralysing the hall with an extra fortissimo, except that M. Goerra never
                        takes his eyes off his piano. The voices and acting alike were unique. A
                        pure child's voice is a wonder in itself and a child's acting is not only
                        imitative bat so spontaneous and light-hearted; they all enjoyed themselves,
                        and even "rugged" delightfully at times. Ml'e. Levi seems to be the
                        oldest-abcut 12 or 13, I suppose; and her voice is beyond the rest, more
                        formed, and full of talent. One boy, Maillot, did a recitative and aria
                        which was as good as could be. And a wee girl-she is pat down at 9
                        years-Bottari by name, showed herself to be the most perfect little actress
                        and singer. The whole house rose at her after her solo in the 3rd act
                        and-best of all-she had all the little mannerisms, the little bow, and the
                        movement of the hand to the conductor for the encore. Barlesi is the comic
                        boy of the troupe, and he has a gift for it. He bas ona delightful passge of
                        arms with the chorus who are all persecuting him. First of all he rolled
                        over and over the stage with another boy, then he eluded them all, and
                        jumped into an empty box! They found him there, lolling in ease and laxary,
                        and pulled him out. Ricciolini, another boy, had more falues and feeling
                        than therest, but not quite their spontaneity and youth. He and Mile Levi
                        are older. They are both children, pretty gracefal children, bat with a
                        touch of the born artiste in them which almost indues comparison with full
                        grown performers-on technical points only; for enjoy ment, they were far
                        above those one hears out here. After the curtain fell thres small boys came
                        on, one after the other, and sang Di quella pira" (from Trovatore ") The
                        first two (they tid it in taras) were serious, bat No. 3, Was comic, with
                        weird cries and heroic capers: then all three came on fogether, and No. 3
                        encouraged his comra les on the high note by his Cornell-Harvardian yells
                        and "monlinet" gestares. Altogether it was an experience, and I hope this
                        will justify my long expatiation thereon. It was far more amusing than our
                        dear Khedivial Opera; those delicions children gave a certain impression,
                        for all our laughter, with the keen innocence of their voices and acting,

                        well)</p>
                    <p>To conclude, I counsel all-the abonnement system excludes so many that this
                        should be of use to a huge section of Cairenes-to go to the Abbas. And I
                        reiterate the wish that that most esteemed director could be-but, wall,

                        was married to Miss Beatrice M.8. Jackson, daughter of Sir Thomas and Lady
                        Jackson, of Standsted, Essex. Bir Thomas Jackson gave his daughter away, and
                        Captain R. A. Markham, Coldstream Guards, acted as best man. The bride was
                        attended by four maids, Mise Dorothy Jackson, Miss Digby, and the Hon.
                        Lettice Digby and Hon. Geraldine Digby, the two little daughters of Lord

                        The title is on sidered here to be an attempt to show the Saitan that the
                        aim of the Bryptian National ist Party is not only Anti-Baropean bot sino
                        Anti-Torkish, and that its object is to conple'e y sever the political ties
                        that bind Beypt to the Sublime Porte. </p>
                    <p>I was talking on the sabjaot only yesterday to a bigb Turkish official who, I

                        considered most probable that the recent fraternization of Mastapha Pasba
                        Kamel with a seation of the advanced Ra diosl party in London slearly proved
                        that the "Patriot" was being infanced by the bitterent enemies of the Baltan
                        in Europe for it was this olique in Eagland who bad slways shown the most
                        fanatie bostility to his Imperial Majesty, and ware unremitting now in their
                        sudeavoors at mischief-making in Macedonia, just as they were in egging on
                        the Greeks to declare war a few years ago. He added that the political
                        siguificance of the choice which Kamel had made for the name of his
                        newspaper was quite well understood here, and that the Porte would not allow
                        the matter to pass opracognised, for such a pretended fervent sabjeet of the
                        Bultan to rise an independent symbol in Bgypt was nothing lers than trosson
                        to the Caliph </p>
                    <p>Whether these suspicions are correct, I havs no means of judging, but the
                        famoura ofloat on this matter are worth recording. Does Most.pba Pasba Kamal

                        polioy Kamel may be quite justified in raining the *Bgyptian Standard" as
                        siga of revolt against the pretensions of the Caliph in order to prove to
                        his supporters in London thist his only objest in the welfare of Egypt, and

                        between the lines, and angar that the appropriation of a treasonable emblem

                            advantage of any sorplas rayanga after the necessary expenditure for
                            each year has been met." </p>
                        <p>Hopeful Signa. | Other hopefal signs are the establishment I by the
                            natives of factories, cooperative banks, and local indastries of various
                            kinds. </p>
                        <p>This improvement, however, lends very | naturally to the presumption that
                            an increme in the price of commodities bas taken and will still further
                            take place. And snob i. indeer the ce. Every year--possibly every half
                            year- an apward movement is recorded in the oost of living. Articles of
                            daily consumption, @ 8., most, bread, egga,obaroon), all shows very
                            marked rise in value, some commodities having increased 200 and 300 per
                            cent in price during the last 4 or 5 years. Rise in Prloes. </p>
                        <p>The report refers to the high prions now paid for Cyprar ponies and the
                            unfavour able effect this has upon the mounts of the Cyprus polica, who
                            have to find their own hormon. A general rise in wage has followed </p>
                        <p>M &amp; matter of Dobrve, and both producers apd | labourers as well as
                            merobants have benefited by the expansion of trade. The official oaas is
                            practically the only section of the community which does not sbare in
                            this prosperity, bot, on the contrary, suffers sadly in consequence of
                            it, and the situation for those Bnglish Government officials receiving
