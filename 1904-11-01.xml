                    <head>THE SETTLEMENT OF THE QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>The satisfactory alleviation of the terrible state of tension which has
                        prevailed throughout the last week, in consequence of the Baltic Fleet
                        outrage, is a matter for the congratulation to the whole world, and as our
                        telegrams announced yesterday, the Continental Press is unanimous in
                        welcoming the agreement for the settlement of this incident by pacific
                        methods. We in Egypt have also special cause for congratulating ourselves on
                        the happy issue, for there is no doubt that had was ensued between England
                        and Russia the coming season would have been in a great measure ruined. But
                        there are larger and more permanent considerations involved in this
                        submission to peaceful settlement, inasmuch as it acknowledges the power of
                        arbitration to settle international disputes, even when they happen to
                        involve questions of vital interest and national honour. As germane to this
                        subject reference may be made to the important article on the settlement of
                        international differences in the latest Fortnightly Review to hand from the
                        able pen of Sir Thomas Barclay, who has had great practical experience in
                        preparing such treaties. It is to be noted, in the first place, that from
                        treaties of arbitration are excluded matters involving the "vital interests"
                        or "national honour" of either party, which is the exclusion of the very
                        matters which seem the only ones capable of influencing public opinion to a
                        dangerous point. What is a "vital interest?" The independence of a state
                        itself is a vital interest. A deliberate breach in the established usage of
                        nations of fundamental importance might be vital to one state and not to
                        another. "Vital," of course, means something of such gravity that it cannot
                        be settled by an award of damages, in which, in other words, there is no
                        solution but reversion to the status quo ante. "National honour" is very
                        like a "vital interest" but it generally arises out of the overheated
                        discussion of some questions which was originally a judicial one. Every
                        question <cb n="6"/> can become one of national honour in the hands of an
                        unskilled diplomacy, and very often what is called national honour is merely
                        the outcome of a one-sided view of a question in which honour plays a very
                        little part. On the other hand, does it much detract from the value of these
                        new treaties that there is a loophole offered by which either nation can
                        escape in an emergency from its obligations? Treaties between nations cannot
                        be viewed exactly in the same light as contracts between individuals. The
                        best we can offer as their sanction is the sense of honour and justice
                        between the contracting parties, and it will always be better to escape from
                        a treaty through its own provisions than by violating them. Peaceable
                        adjustment of differences in the dealings of nations with each other has
                        been the dream of every enlightened man who ever thought upon the subject.
                        The Alabama case, the establishment of a Permanent Court of Judicature at
                        The Hague, and the new obilgation entered into by Great Britain and France,
                        so rapidly followed by others, to submit all their differences of a judicial
                        order to The Hague Tribunal, are the three events which stand out as
                        landmarks of progress towards that ideal.</p>
                    <p>Crtics of these treaties have not understood what the practical effect of an
                        obligatory treaty of arbitration is. They view a treaty of arbitration in
                        the light of a restraint placed upon the contracting Governments. They
                        assume that Governments are bloodthirsty ogres only too anxious to plunge
                        their countries into fire and blooshed, and that a muzzle has to be put upon
                        them and that they only yeild to pressure and negociate such treaties with
                        reluctance. It is indeed a grave mistake to think that democratic
                        Governments, at the present day, can afford to view arbitration with
                        distrust. Foreign offices and diplomatists may have misgivings about
                        details, even very essential details, but they can have little objection to
                        pacific methods of any kind for the settlement of international differences
                        as they can have to the whole protocol system of diplomacy. Diplomacy has no
                        raison d'etre but that it is itself a pacific method, and its history has
                        been one of constantly adding of varieties to its provision of devices for
                        keeping a question open. A permanent treaty of arbitration is an additional
                        device in the hands of diplomacy for this purpose. It is not a shackle
                        impeding the free activity of the diplomatist, but an instrument in his
                        hands by which ha can make another last endeavour to settle any difficulty
                        when all his other instruments have proved unavailing. It is usual to speak
                        of arbitration as applicable "when diplomacy has failed," as in the Hague
                        Peace Convention, the treaty of 1897, etc., but it is evident that diplomacy
                        must be the medium of negotiation for this further stage in pacific efforts.
                        The de facto position "when diplomacy ahs failed," is that the diplomatist
                        is recalled by his Government, and there is then little hope of peace but in
                        the mediation of an independent Government and its acceptance by the two
                        parties. With a permanent treaty of arbitration in existence between the two
                        parties, the danger of such a breakdown is, at any rate, poatponed. The
                        diplomatist is not recalled. The only difference is that negotiations are
                        turned into a new channel, in accordance with the terms of the treaty. Under
                        the provisions of these new treaties there will be a number of questions for
                        diplomacy to settle. First of all, there is the question of whether any
                        "vital interest" or "national honour" is involved, and if not, and the
                        question is determined be judicial order, the exact subject of dispute will
                        have to be settled – that is to say, the subject will have to be narrowed
                        down to a precise issue, and even then the powers of the arbitrators and the
                        details of procedure will have to be fixed. All this means machinery at the
                        disposal of the diplomatist. When in 1856 the Treaty of Paris was under
                        discussion, Mr. Gladstone said, "No country ought to resort to arbitration
                        until it had reduced its claims to that</p>

                    <cb n="1"/>
                    <p>condition in which they were fit to be supported y force." It will be for the
                        diplomatists under these treaties to reduce the respective claims of their
                        Governments to the minimum, to bring them down to the essential point of
                        points beyond which neither Government will give way. In many cases,
                        probably this whittling process will suggest solution, as in private
                        litigation, and they will be "settled out of court."</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it would be mere optimism to think the diplomatist in this
                        further stage of negotiations will always be successful. There are
                        diplomatists of the "new school," who like to carry on their business in the
                        broad light of day, and think the hand-claps of an audience help them to
                        their task. There are others – and thank goodness they are the majority –
                        who prefer the more noble and, as history has proved, more successful
                        methods by which diplomacy has earned an honourable and a commendable
                        meaning. Lord Dufferin once observed that war, in his opinion, was generally
                        an accident of diplomacy. To avoid such accidents, men trained in the
                        courtesy of nations, and gifted with the necessary graces of mind and
                        manner, and with resourcefulness – the most essential quality of the
                        diplomatists – should of course be selected to fill, at any rate, the more
                        delicate positions. Mistakes inherent to things human can be laid to the
                        charge of most Governments in their choice of representatives; one of the
                        advantages of permanent treaties of arbitration will be to make errors
                        remediable. It is not, by the way, without its lesson that the United States
                        Governments select their diplomatic representatives from among men of the
                        whole party who seem to the President, by their natural gifts and character,
                        and experience and knowledge of their country's practical affairs, best
                        adapted for each responsible post. It is certain that the United States have
                        not been able, in spite of certain shortcomings, through their diplomatic
                        representatives, to make friends for their country all over the world. The
                        best engine can be driven inefficiently. The Anglo-French Treaty, in the
                        hands of a skilled driver, is quite a storehouse of resources for the
                        prolongation of negotitations. We may assume that when a difficulty arises
                        the object of the one or the other Government will be from the very first
                        peace or war. If it be peace, they will have ample means of removing the
                        subject from the danger of acute public contoversy. National passions, like
                        most other nervous maladies, are generally curable if left to the benign
                        influence of time. To gain time in an emergency is generally the difficulty.
                        The Anglo-French Treaty will certainly enable the Governemnts, if they wish
                        to profit by it, to gain all the time they want. The employment of paicifc
                        methods in arranging international difficulties in a commanding event in the
                        history of the progress of civilisation, and is one of the greatest works
                        with which statesmen can couple their names. "The greatest of British
                        interests is peace." At any rate, it is a "vital interest" of the democratic
                        elements of every nation, and the satisfactory solution of last week's
                        incident, whereby a Russian Trafalgar has been averted, should be acclaimed
                        by all who have the interests of international comity at heart. Just as
                        England was the pioneer of civilisation in her efforts to suppress the slave
                        trade, so here again she will be found in the vanguard of nations desirous
                        of maintaining the world's peace, and the entire civilised world should be
                        grateful from draing the sword when our national honour and sense of
                        humanity had been so deeply wounded by the piratical escapades of the Baltic
                        fleet.</p>

                    <p>– Names of African tribes are generally a puzzle to the uninitiated, but few
                        would suspect the origin of "Niam-Niam" – the name of the tribe to whose
                        country the Sudan Government is said to be sending an expedition. It is not
                        the designation by which the people call themselves, which is A-Zandeh. The
                        A-Zandeh are noted for their intelligance and for a degree of culture
                        considerably in advance of neighbouring tribes; they are also noted for
                        their cannibal proclivities, and it is credibly stated – by travellers such
                        as Schweinfurth – that "Niam-Niam" is nothing more than the nickname
                        bestowed by the Arabs in imitation of the sound made by the A-Zandeh when
                        enjoying one of their cannibal feasts. It is to the Arabs, by the way, that
                        we owe the common word Kaffir – i.e., and unbeliever in Mohamed.</p>

                    <head>NIAM-NIAM EXPEDITION.<lb/>UNFOUNDED REPORTS.</head>
                    <p>A number of our English contemporaries published the following telegram from
                        Cairo last week:– </p>
                    <p>"The expedition to the Niam-Niam country has now been definitely decided
                        upon, and, as already stated, it will be composed of about two thousend
                        Sudanese troops under British officers. The base of the expedition will be
                        Wao, in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. Stores are now being rapidly accumulated there.
                        It is hoped to make a start some time in December. It is now believed the
                        Niam-Niams have a force of fully 15,000 fighting men.</p>
                    <p>"Major Boulnois, R.A., of the Egyptian Army, will take command of the
                        expedition. His force will consist of a company of Mounted Infantry, the 9th
                        and the 10th Sudanese battalions, and half of the 15th battalion, with
                        Maxims.</p>
                    <p>"It will be remembered that in February of this year Major Boulnois, with a
                        force of about 1,000 men, attempted to reach the Niam-Niam country, but in
                        view of the threatening attitude of the inhabitants and the smallness of his
                        force he was compelled to retire. The Niam-Niams are a vigorous Sudanese
                        race, very jealous of their independence, and likely to resent any attempt
                        on the part of the Government of the Sudan to enter into relations with
                        them. They have Remington rifles, and also use bows and poisoned arrows. The
                        country is most difficult, being covered with long grass, and the paths
                        which intersect it are so narrow that it is only possible to march in a
                        single file. Water, however, is said to be plentiful."</p>
                    <p>We can only say that the above statements are greatly exaggerated. On enquiry
                        at official sources we learn that there is no question of a campaign against
                        the whole of the Niam-Niam tribe. The above story probably originated from
                        the fact that the Sirdar and Major Boulnois are going shortly on an
                        inspection of the Bahr-el-Ghazal garrison, and Yambio, gave some trouble to
                        the authorities a few months ago.</p>

                        I did not join Mr. Wells as a leader in his expedition, neither was the

                        halt at Um Garaiart to rest and water his camels, and I took the opportunity

                    <p>An application has been addressed to the Ministry of Public Works for
                        permission to institute a service of motor wagons for the transport of sand
                        and stones from the quarries in the neighbourhood of the Capital. Messrs.
                        Theocaridis and Adamidis, of Alexandria, are the applicants.</p>
                    <p>While the question of motor wagons is under consideration, it is worth while
                        asking why some energetic capitalist does not also apply for a permit to
                        work motor 'buses in Cairo. The present 'buses are eyesores as vehicles,
                        cumbersome in construction, constantly obstructing traffic, and far too
                        heavy for the miserable quadrupeds which have to draw them. We understand
                        that the Omnibus Company is composed of some of the most influential
                        capitalists in Cairo and it returns a substantial dividend of, so rumor hath
                        it, about 80 per cent. per annum. A 4 share in this company is now worth 20,
                        so there should be every chance for successfully launching a motor omnibus
                        company, as there are many streets in Cairo, especially in the native
                        quarters, which can never be tapped by the Tramway Company. Moreover, many
                        of the narrow streets in the native quarters, where a small motor 'bus
                        carrying sixteen passengers could circulate, would not be available for the
                        cumberous omnibuses now in vogue.</p>

                    <p>A Paris corespondent writes under date of the 23rd inst:– </p>
                    <p>An Egyptian adventurer, who gave himself out as Prince George, and is said to
                        be the son of a Cairo diamond merchant, has been tried and convicted for
                        swindling Paris jewellers and dealers in precious stones. This man, who
                        lived in a garret of the slums, was able by his representation to obtain on
                        credit rubies, diamonds, pearls, and sapphires from nearly a dozen dealers.
                        From one jeweller alone he had goods worth 2,000. The sham prince was well
                        known in the world of amusement. He associated with actresses, variety
                        artists, circus riders, tight-rope dancers, and several demi-mondaines,
                        including Blondinette Daleza, who was brought forward prominently in the
                        romance of the phantom millions as the friend of Romain Daurignac, Madame
                        Humbert's gay brother. Mdlle. Daleza, who has appeared occasionally on the
                        stage, was called as a witness yesterday in the Ninth Correctional Chamber,
                        where "Prince George," the Egyptian, was tried. She said that she knew the
                        prince cheifly through his little friend, Madame Karat, of the Marigny
                        Theatre. George was presented to Mdlle. Daleza at the Cascade Restaurant in
                        the Peir de Boulogne, and she subsequently saw him waiting for Madame Karat
                        at the Marigny rehearsals. One day George put two valuable rings on Madame
                        Karat's fingers. "Did he ever put any on yours?" queried the President of
                        the Court. "No," said Blondinette, "he never gave me anything. A few days
                        ago he came to me, and asked me to tell his little friend Karat that he was
                        called away suddenly to Brussels." Also, in answer to the President, Mdlle.
                        Daleza said that George spent a lot of money, and lived like a man who had
                        12,000 a year. He hired a carriage and pair for Karat, and had for himself a
                        luxurious motor-car of the most modern make. The Egyptian was sentenced to
                        imprisonment for two years and a fine of 20, this being the maximum penalty
                        in his case.</p>

                    <p>It is reported from Berber that a new Mahdi, named Abou Zeid Mohamed Farah,
                        of the Chanatir tribe, has arisen there. The Moudir, in presence of the
                        supporters of his divine mission, stated, after a medical examination, that
                        the man was suffering from religious mania, and so the false Mahdi has been
                        imrisoned.</p>

                    <p>Angier's Emulsion is the remedy above all others for healing the diseased
                        tissues and building up health and strength after fevers, or after any
                        illness affecting the digestive functions. Made with our specially purified
                        petroleum it possesses soothing, healing and antiseptic properties which,
                        acting upon the impaired digestive organs, restore them to a normal, healthy

                    <head>SUDAN IRRIGATION.</head>
                    <p>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector-General of Irrigation in Lower
                        Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>(Continued.)</p>
                    <p>The barrage proposed is estimated by Sir W. Garstin to cost L.E. 1,000,000.
                        For the canal system in connection with it he has allowed a figure of L.E.
                        2,000,000, of which L.E. 500,000 is included in the list of most urgent
                        works, together with the L.E. 1,000,000 for the barrage itself. If a weir
                        has to be combined wuth the barrage, the cost of the combined work would
                        probably be about L.E. 1,500,000. Sir W. Garstin, in his estimate of
                        returns, enters 700,000 acres of Ghezireh lands as paying taxes; that is,
                        after the eventual expenditure of L.E. 2,000,000 on the canal system, and
                        L.E. 1,000,000 on the barrage.</p>
                    <p>It appears to me possible to conduct basin irrigation as practised in Upper
                        Egypt alongside winter irrigation as practised in Lower Egypt. A
                        demonstration of the possibility exists – or until quite lately existed – in
                        Middle Egypt, where basin irrigation along the Bahr Yusuf has been carried
                        on alongside the Ibrahimieh Canal tract within which winter crops are
                        irrigated by field channels. The basin area could perhaps be embanked and
                        canalised at a less rate per acre than the winter irrigation area; but a
                        rate of L.E. 3 an acre as a mean for both would not be too much to
                        allow.</p>
                    <p>Sir W. Garstin's estimate is as below:– </p>
                    <p>Cost (Eventual). L.E.</p>
                    <p>Barrage in Blue Nile 1,000,000</p>
                    <p>Ghezireh Canal system, for 700,000 acres 2,000,000</p>
                    <p>Total 3,000,000</p>
                    <p>Revenues from Taxation (Eventual).</p>
                    <p>Ghezireh lands, say 700,000 acres, at P.T. 50 350,000 – that is 11 ½ per
                        cent. of the cost.</p>
                    <p>Using now, the figures that I have suggested, and assuming a tax of only P.T.
                        30 on the basin lands – a very low tax – the estimates would become:– </p>
                    <p>Cost. L.E.</p>
                    <p>Barrage and weir 1,500,000</p>
                    <p>Canal and basin system for 2,000,000 acres, at E. 3 per acre 6,000,000</p>
                    <p>Total 7,500,000</p>
                    <p>Revenue from Taxation.</p>
                    <p>Winter irrigation, 1,000,000 acres, at P.T. 50 500,000</p>
                    <p>Flood irrigation, 1,000,000 acres, at P.T. 30 300,000</p>
                    <p>Total 800,000 – that is, a little over 10 ½ per cent. of the cost.</p>
                    <p>One of the advantages of the system of basin irrigation for the Sudan is that
                        large areas can be cultivated with very few labourers, and, as population is
                        wanting, this seems to be an important consideration.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest, as a general idea for the utilisation of the Blue Nile
                        naturak discharges, the following elaboration of Sir W. Garstin's proposals
                        – a suggestion which has already been made by Sir W. Willcacks, in 1901, on
                        page 22 of his pamphlet entitles "The Nile Reservoir Dam at Assouan and
                        After."</p>
                    <p>A combined barrage and weir to hold up 6 ½ m. of water, with head works and
                        distributing canals on both banks of the river, would be built below the
                        Rahad River junction with the Blue Nile. The canal on the left bank would be
                        designed to irrigate 500,000 acres in the Gezireh, immediately to the south
                        of Khartoum, by field channels during winter. The canal on the right bank
                        would be designed to irrigate another half million acres by field channels
                        during winter, and, in addition, to feed the flood canals of 1,000,000 acres
                        of land to be embarked and inundated annually on the Upper Egypt basin
                        system; or a separate canal system for the basin area might take off from
                        above the barrage, probably the preferable alternative. These basin lands
                        would lie somewhere between Wad Medani and Shendy or Berber, but the actual
                        levels of the ground would determine their situation definitely. Probably
                        the larger portion of what is known as Meroe Island (an Area of some 30,000
                        square-kiloms., or 7 million acres, lying between the Blue Nile and the
                        Atbara) will prove to be too high to be commanded by the Blue Nile water at
                        the Rahad Junction.</p>

                    <p>As I write these lines England and the Empire are seething with indignation
                        and the crowning act of folly on the part of the Baltic Squadron – that
                        miserable collection of specimens and rattle-traps. Before these lines are
                        in print more will be heard of the matter in no uncertain tones, for there
                        is no mistaking the temper of the Empire. The Press, from the hottest
                        Imperialist to the most advanced Little Englander – aye, even the
                        disloyalest of the Irish paper – demands the utmost reparation for the
                        slaughter of defenceless toilers of the deep and the insult to the Empire's
                        flag. It was an act of unpardonable folly and cowardice to deliberately
                        bombard a helpless fleet of trawlers for twenty minutes, 12,000 miles
                        distant from the seat of war. In the nation's present temper it is safe to
                        say that it will take diplomacy all its time to avert war.</p>

                        after nearly six years'service in the ranks was given a commission in the
                        Seaforth Highlanders. With the Seaforths he went through the Hazara

                        adjutant of the 2nd Battalion (medal with clasps). In 1897 he was promoted
                        captain into the Innis-killings and was with the 2nd Battalion in the
                        closing stages of the war in the Petersburg district (mentioned in

                    <p>At the Guildhall, before Mr. alderman Morris last week, Mr. James Orchard
                        Oxley, of 31, Lombard-street. E.C., was summoned for committing an assault
                        upon Mr. Cavendish D.E. Liardet, of 16, St. Helen's-place, Bishops gate,
                        E.C. The defendant pleaded guilty, but said he received provocation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bennett, who prosecuted, sated that the assault took place at Winchester
                        House, Old Broad-street. The complainant was a share-holder in a company,
                        the name of which he need not mention, and on the day in question, the 12th
                        inst., a meeting was called to enable the shareholders to hear a statement
                        from the voluntary liquidator as to the promotion and financial condition of
                        the company. The meeting was held at Winchester House, and the complainant
                        attended, and read some letters he had received from the Egyptian
                        Government, which bore in a material way upon the promotion of this company.
                        At the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Liardet left the room, and had reached
                        the corridor when, without any warning, the defendant seized him by the coat
                        and struck him in the face. A second low felled him to the ground.
                        Complainant sustained a nasty cut on the cheek, evidently from a ring, and
                        two of his teeth were loosened. He had suffered very much from this
                        unprovoked assault, and had not yet recovered from the effects. The parties
                        were related, being first cousins. Defendant was a company promoter, and for
                        some time complainant was his general manager.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Liardet, whose face was still bandaged, was called, and stated that when
                        the defendant stopped him at the conclusion of the meeting, he said: "I will
                        give you something for reading those Egyptian letters in the City." He was
                        struck three blows in all; his glasses were hurled in one direction and his
                        hat in another, the latter being smashed. Witness was formerly general
                        business manager to Oxley and Co., but left them last July. Having recovered
                        himself, he went for a constable; but, in the meantime, the defendant had
                        disappeared. Cross-examined by the defendant, Mr. Liardet admitted raising
                        his umbrella between the second and third blows. He described the assault as
                        being a "fair knockout."</p>
                    <p>The defendant declined the suggestion of the Alderman to compensate the
                        complainant and was fined 40s., with 3 3s. costs.</p>
                    <p>[The meeting in question was that of the Egyptian and Sudan Minerals, Ltd. in

                        <p>Sir,– Would "Humble Imperialist" be surprised to learn that if India were
                            garrisoned as Egypt is now, 180,000 British troops would be required
                            instead of 70,000, which are now considered adequate? It is therefore
                            evident that 2,500 men are quite sufficient for Egypt with a population
                            of 11,000,000 if 70,000 be enough for India, the inhabitants of which
                            number 300,000,000; so that the authorities at home, in reducing the
                            garrison here, are quite as level-headed as we, and much more
                            disinterested.</p>
                        <p>In india there are 45 quasi-independent princes and chiefs who are
                            entitled to salutes of 13-21 guns; how many are there here? One. Egypt
                            has no enemy on her fronteirs. What about India? Anyone may "think in
                            millions," the great thing is to have the millions to think about.</p>

                        <p>Sir,– Surely the true interests of archaeology are not served when it
                            tries to overreach its importance. No one who is intimately acquainted
                            with the country can deny the great benefit of the Assouan dam; and when
                            men so eminent in their profession as Sir William Garstin and Sir
                            William Willcocks tell us that there is no alternative to the submersion
                            of Philae, archaeology has to draw the shorter. It is to be regretted
                            that Sir William Garstin's suggestion to transfer the temples to the
                            island of Biggeh was not acted upon. I could instance numerous cases in
                            Germany (where the preservation of monuments is admirably organised), in
                            which monuments under necessity have been raised or removed. The
                            principle of taking down and rebuilding has been admitted in the case of
                            temples of Karnak and Edfu, and though it is to be deplored if the
                            original site must be abandoned, there are cases of force majeure.</p>
                        <p>In germany a classified list of monuments from the Prehistoric down to
                            recent times has been drawn up and a conservator, quite independent of
                            museums, restoration committees, etc., been appointed for each province.
                            He acts as a kind of trustee for the monuments. Nothing can be done
                            concerning them without his being satisfied and giving his fiat, and it
                            is he who in case of need urges the respective departments to undertake
                            what is necessary, and he sees to the framing of laws required, etc.
                            Anyone throughly acquainted with this matter in Egypt knows how much
                            such a conservator is needed. We have the monuments of ancient time, of
                            the Moslem and of the Coptic period, and we must not ignore that they
                            from an important asset in a tourist country. The post might be attached
                            to the Antiquity Service, the Public Works, or even to Capt. Lyons'
                            dept., which seems to emulate the Court for Divorce, Probate and
                            Admiralty.</p>
                        <p>Had there been such a conservaotr much of the periodically recurrent
                            attacks upon the Irrigation Service would have been avoided. He would
                            have defended steps taken in unison with him, and archaeologists could
                            have had confidence in this ruling. As the case stands, Sir William
                            Garstin is in the anomalous position of having, as chief of the
                            Irrigation, to recommend steps which are diametrically opposed to the
                            preservation of monuments, which latter is one of his duties as Minister
                            of Public Works.</p>

                    <p>A circular has been sent out to shareholders in the Nubia (Sudan) Development
                        Company, Limited, containg a summary of the report of the engineer, Mr.
                        Peregrine O. Wilson, under whose direction and personal supervision the
                        company's concession has been prospected. The report is of an encouraging
                        nature, Mr. Wilson in his general conclusions stating:– </p>
                    <p>Reviewing the situation generally, I am of the opinion that, considering the
                        short time and the delays inseparable from starting new work in a distant
                        country, an immense amount of work has been done, and that future results
                        will amply justify the money and labour already expended. The promises
                        conveyed by such extensive discovereis of ancient workings, with the
                        satisfactory pannings and assays that they yielded, seem to fully warrant
                        the exploration work and the subsequent sinking of shafts in various reefs.
                        These reefs show every indication of proving permanent, and have given very
                        good pannings. The assays vary greatly, some giving as much as 3 ozs. to the
                        ton, and others only a few dwts.</p>

                    <p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
                    <p>Oranisation of the lottery. The Royal Hungarian Lottery consists of 110,000
                        Tickets of which 55,000 will be drawn with prizes and 1 premium. The tickets
                        bear the Royal Hungarian Arma and an English translation.</p>
                    <p>Drawings. The drawings will take place publicly under the auspices of the
                        Royal Hungarian Government, and in the presence of a State Notary.</p>
                    <p>Drawing Lists. After the drawings the participants will receive an official
                        list of drawn numbers with prizes.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence in English, French, Italian, and all principal languages.</p>
                    <p>The official prospectus will be added to each order and will be sent
                        beforehand on application.</p>
                    <p>Payment of prizes. All prizes are payable after the drawing in each, on
                        returning the drawn ticket. To our foreign correspondents we transmit small
                        prizes by mail, larger amounts will be paid out in cheques by the medium of
                        banking houses in all large towns of the world.</p>
                    <p>N.B. To prevent any misapprehension, arising but too frequently in the public
                        mind, we beg to point out that a winning ticket in the Royal Hungarian
                        Lottery, lawfully acquired and paid for, affords its owner the same
                        guarantee for payment as a banknote issued by the Bank of England.</p>

                    <p>Participation in all Six Drawings.</p>
                    <p>The majority of clients prefer to secure at once the right to paricipate in
                        all of the six drawings, which is judicious considering the appreciation in
                        value from drawing to drawing, and the great advantage offered, especially
                        by the 6th drawing, when the largest prizes and the premium of 600,000
                        crowns are drawn, amounting together to more than ten millions of
                        crowns.</p>
                    <p>In order to enable the purchaser to secure the full advantage thereof, we are
                        prepared to guarantee such participation in all the six drawings against two
                        equal payments: one payment on application, viz:– </p>
                    <p>Crowns 80 84 fr. 3 6/8 for one Whole Ticket.</p>

                    <p>And the other before the 5th drawing, but naturally the latter only to be
                        made in case the number of the tivket should not have already won a prize at
                        a previous drawing.</p>
                    <p>Every order must be accompained by its value by money order, which please
                        fill out in Crowns, on receipt of which the desired tickets will be sent by
                        return of mail. If you prefer remitting bank notes, cheques, coupons, etc.,
                        you are requested to have your letter registered.</p>
