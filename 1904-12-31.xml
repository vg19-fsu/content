                    <p>"Ring out the ol ring in the new."</p>
                    <p>Englishmen residing in Egypt often, as New Year's Day comes round, think of
                        the merry peals of bells, the sound of which comes floating on the midnight
                        air in the old, country, and tells of the end of one year and the
                        commencement of another The occasion cannot be divorced from sen ment, and
                        we hope it never will be. We do not attach too great importance to the good
                        resolutions for the New Year so often formed, for they seldom bear fruit,
                        and however determined we may be that we will "turn over a new leaf" and
                        adopt a new line of conduct, the end January finds u's slipping back into
                        the old grooves, and another month generally sees us following on the old
                        lines, just as if in the interim there had been no New Year's resolutions
                        formed at all. Why they should be is to some people a puzzle, for surely, if
                        a change in our habits is desirable, it is never worth while to wait a
                        single hour before effecting it, one day being quite as good as another for
                        the purpose.</p>
                    <p>Although nature makes no sign to mark the commencement of a new year, and the
                        sun rises later on the morning of the 1st of January than on the 31st
                        December, wile the daylight has for some days past been lengthening in the
                        evening, the business man could not dispense with a fixed date for the
                        closing of his accounts and the taking of stock. The past year has been one
                        of such abounding prosperity to this country that there can be few
                        Englishmen doing business in Egyptian cities who have not shared in the
                        general good fortune that has attended the year 1904. Nor is there the least
                        sign that 1905 will witness any check to the full tide of prosperity at
                        present flowing. We fully expect to find it running as strong as ever when
                        1906 takes the place of the year now opening.</p>
                    <p>But private enterprise needs to be accompanied by energetic action on the
                        part of those <cb n="6"/> in authority, and public improvements should keep
                        pace with, in order that the greatest benefits may be secured to the
                        community in general. Making the fullest allowance for the fact that modern
                        ideas take a long time to enforce themselves upon the Eastern mind, and at
                        the same time bearing in mind that Egypt belongs to the Egyptians and not to
                        treat Britain or any other Power, we still have a right to demand a quid pro
                        quo in many matters of the utmost importance to the general well-being. Take
                        for instance, sanitary improvements. While throughout the country, in the
                        towns and villages, where few but natives reside, we can only bring about
                        better conditions of life by a slow process of education, in the large
                        cities of Cairo and Alexandria a different order of things revails, and it
                        is only right that those who have by the employment of capital and business
                        ability enriched Egyptians as well a themselves, and by their enterprise
                        have so greatly helped to bring about the prosperity of which we have
                        spoken, should have the opportunity, afforded them of living in as good
                        conditions as it is possible to obtain. Unfortunately, sanitary matters are
                        not considered by many Europeans to be of the importance that we English
                        attach to them, and so it is somewhat difficult to arouse strong and united
                        action in this direction None the less should the desirability of good
                        sanitary conditions be pressed upon the authorities in season and out of
                        season,</p>
                    <p>The year now osing has witnessed a great stride on the pathet progress. Even
                        if the Anglo- French Agreement were the only step taken, that alone would
                        make 1904 a red-letter, year in the history of modern Egypt: The
                        possibilities resultant from its adoption are being so fully dealt with in
                        the various articles and reports we are now publishing from day to day
                        -especially in that entitled "Egypt in 1904" from the penot, Sir Eldon
                        Gorst,--that it is unnecessary fous to enlarge on this topic. Suffice it to
                        say at these resultant possibilities seem boundle and at present beyond
                        estimate.</p>
                    <p>Egypt is in the happy position of not having to trouble herself much as to
                        foreign complica tions. The share of the burden she would have to take in
                        these is for the present lifted from her shoulders, and there is nothing
                        whatever to interfere with her bending all her energies to internal reforms
                        and measures for the good of the people. It is somewhat the fashion to
                        minimise the influence of the ruler of the country, and H.H. the Khedive
                        sometimes gets very scant and grudging appreciation for his steady if little
                        notice efforts for the good of his people. Peop are ever ready to talk of
                        the excesses of Ismail, and how he plunged the country into misery and
                        financial ruin by his extravagances in future years, perhaps, if not now,
                        the share that Abbas II. has taken in the redemption of the country from its
                        burdens may be more generally known and appreciated. It is matter or
                        congratulation that Lord Cromer is still at his post, and that his task
                        promises for the future to be a comparatively easy one. He has piloted the
                        good Ship of State through the shoals and now to all appearance it is safely
                        anchored in the harbour. When the time comes-and we trust it is still far
                        distant -for him to retire, he will carry with him the well-nigh universal
                        gratitude of the Egyptian nation for the services he has so ably rendered to
                        the country. Want of space forbids us to touch upon the many questions on
                        which we could write, and we conclude by adopting the good old custom of
                        wishing our readers "A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR,"</p>

                            to spend the cold season. Consequently the number of tourists is always
                            increasing. A great many of these begin the study of English, French,
                            Arabic, Italian, German/etc., at the Berlitz Schools at Cairo (Sharia
                            Kamel) and Alexandria (26, Rue de l'Eglise Copte), while many others

                        of its steamers. Messrs. Mackie, of White Horse Whisky fame (Mr. N. Spathis,
                        agent), are giving away a useful ashtray, while Mr. Spathis himself is

                    <p>Much additional light is thrown on this subject by an article in the new
                        number of the Stock Exchange Gazette. Our London contemporary continues its
                        criticism on the methods of the Suez Canal, and, referring to the events
                        proceding the London Agreement, states as follows:- "We assert most
                        emphatically that it was nothing but the threat to build another canal which
                        induced M. de Lesseps to hurry over to London, where he approached the
                        Council of the Chamber of Shipping. By the energetic action of this body the
                        way was paved and all arrangements made for obtaining a rival concession,
                        and everything was in readiness for the construction of an alternative route
                        between the Mediterranean and Red Sea. As M. de Lesseps agreed to do
                        practically everything he was requested, it was not consid ered necessary to
                        proceed further with the rival scheme." It will be interesting to hear what
                        reply the partisans of the present Canal have to make to so definite an
                        assertion.</p>

                    <head>ORIENT LINE AND SUEZ CANAL.</head>
                    <p>Although the directors of the Orient Line have not yet made any definite
                        announcement on the subject, little doubt is felt that the company will
                        avoid the Suez Canal, and proceed via the Cape route, when the existing mail
                        contract with Australia expires to-day. Had it not been for this contract
                        the company would long ago have adopted the South Atlantic route, for it
                        would probably be found that were the Canal dues deducted from the sum
                        received for mail transport, very little has remained to the company as net
                        profit. For the year ended December last the accounts showed a net balance
                        of £34,524, a decline of £7,749, and if the dividend of 5 per cent. is to be
                        maintained it is absolutely necessary that the company should, by some means
                        or other, escape such a burden as is constituted by the Canal charges. It
                        is, of course, obvious that in adopting the Cape route there will be an
                        increase in the coal bill; this, however, should be more than compensated by
                        freights picked up in South African ports.</p>

                        inhabitants for weeks past with its untimely and dilatory renovation of the
                        streets of the Esbekieh quarter, has now for the time turned its attention
                        to the Sharia Mohamed Ali, which, it must be confessed, was in very urgent
                        need of relaying. The traffic through this thoroughfare is, as everyone
                        knows, one of the most important in the town outside of the Esbekieb, and it
                        is but just that it should have the advantage of the care of the T.D. from
                        time to time, but it really seems to be a favorite with the powers that be,
                        for it is being relaid with a celerity that had it been shown in the work of
                        the Esbekieh would have saved a number of your correspondents all the ink
                        and paper they employed to tell you of the woes we were enduring. Perhaps it
                        is that the Department has been stirred up to new activity by your
                        correspondents, but in any case the despatch they are now employing is to be
                        most highly commended.</p>

                        Massie Blomfield. The Swedish ships contributed platform ornamentation which
                        was universally admired. These, with a judicious use of palms from the
                        Signal Station and the pretty green of the newly-painted walls as a
                        background, gave the place a very picturesque appearance. The Municipality
                        sent a large selection of pot plants, which decorated the platform, and Mrs.
                        Crafton, Ramleh, gave flowers and ivy for the tables. The whole appearance
                        of the place was so sweet and harmonious as to elicit a very complimentary
                        remark from the chairman.</p>
                    <p>At 6.30 the doors were thrown open and the men invited to a sumptuous repast,
                        and the full seating capacity of the hall was at once requisitioned to
                        accommodate them. Every one got a liberal helping of turkey, ham, beef, or
                        tongue; and while they were still at table, a packet of tobacco, a 'Xmas
                        card, and an orange were handed to each. The tobacco was supplied this year
                        again by Mr. and Mrs. Gould, and a very hearty cheer was given to them for
                        their kindness before the men rose from their repast. When the wants of the
                        inner man had been attended to, the tables were cleared away, and the hall
                        was prepared for the concert which followed. The chair was taken by Mr. E.
                        B. Gould, I.S.O., H.B.M.'s Consul-General, Alexandria. The entertainment was
                        of such a high class order that closing time came before it was realised it
                        was so late. A most enjoyable evening was brought to a close by the usual
                        votes of thanks to the donors, committee, and artistes proposed by the
                        chairman, who took advan tage of the opportunity to wish the audience a very
                        happy and prosperous New Year. The audience then stood up to sing "God save
                        the King," and the meeting broke up with three lusty cheers, by which the
                        men expressed their appreciation of the kindness shown them.</p>

                    <p>With the Christmas season thoughts na turally come of "Peace on earth,
                        goodwill to men." There is little of the former, un- fortunately, for it but
                        two great nations are actually at war, unrest is to be seen in many
                        directions, and it seems only too possi- ble that at any moment, the torch
                        may be applied to some part of the imflammable ele ments so ready to
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>But "goodwill to men" is a very different matter, and applies in full force
                        to the indi- vidual, even if so little recognised by the nations. I cannot
                        do better, especially at the present season, than consider the question
                        dealt with in a leading article in the Gazette of the 9th inst., entitled
                        "Industrial Homes for Girls."</p>
                    <p>In this article the opinion was expressed that philanthropic work-especially
                        that esta- blished for the rescue of homeless and des situte children should
                        be undertaken by Government instead of being left to voluntary effort on the
                        part of private individuals. In this I cannot agrée with the writer, my
                        experience in such work leading me to pre- cisely, the opposite
                        conclusion.</p>
                    <p>No government in the world could carry on such a work as that of Dr. Barnardo
                        or get such an amount of work out of its officials as the doctor dos out of
                        his helpers. The ideal government has yet to be formed, and if I were to
                        attempt to enumerate what I would consider to be the duties of such a
                        government, I am afraid I should be classed by many as one of those
                        pestiferous characters, a social reformer.</p>
                    <p>The concluding part of the article referred- to the many homeless children
                        who may be seen sleeping on the Esbekieh footpaths in Cairo, as well as,
                        doubtless, in many other places. But would any institution, govern- ment or
                        voluntary, succeed in getting these children to enter its doors otherwise
                        than by compulsion? A few-a very few-might, but in England-where the climate
                        is far more rigorous and less adapted for sleeping-out-the effort to induce
                        such children as sleep out on the Thames embankment and in the London parks
                        to come into Homes has had to be aban- doned as productive of no good
                        results.</p>
                    <p>The cases of real destitution worthy of help seldom show themselves to the
                        public eye, they are only to be found by being sought out -at cast this is
                        so in England. We have only to read the awful cases of deaths from <floatingText>

                        suffering is endured in silence, where help would be freely given if only
                        the facts of the case were brought under the notice of the many charitable
                        societies existing. The Charity Organisation Society is the only institution
                        I know of in England likely to turn a deaf ear to such cases, and even that
                        sham of shams might try to avert absolute starvation.</p>
                    <p>From all I can learn there is far less likeli hood of such suffering among
                        Arabs, and my own observation leads me to precisely the same conclusion.
                        Poverty undoubtedly there is, but what appear to English superficial
                        observers as cases of hardship may in reality be nothing of the sort after
                        all, when differences in mode of living are taken into account.</p>
                    <p>Educate the rising generation, help the natives to understand the conditions
                        necessary to ensure good health, modernise their customs (if you can), and
                        you will bring them more into line with Europeans and lessen the chance of
                        epidemics of plague and cholera; but attempt to interfere with the free
                        open-air life of the natives except to repress crime, and I think you will
                        find such a course of action to be a mistake.</p>
                    <p>But if I am wrong, and if good really can be effected by Training and
                        Industrial Homes for the non-criminal class in Egypt, let such homes be
                        established by voluntary effort and the coming forward of some Egyptian Dr.
                        Barnardo. Far greater success would attend them than if Government
                        established and officialdom was left to manage them.</p>
                    <p>I regret that the article I referred to did not bring some expressions of
                        opinion from those who know Egypt and its need better than myself. I can
                        only speak from many years' practical experience of rescue work in England,
                        and on that experience base my conclusions, modified only to the extent of
                        my observations during two years' resi- dence in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>I have had, however, no hesitation in giving my opinion that work of this
                        kind is immeasura bly better done in the hands of private indi- viduals than
                        it could possibly be under Government supervision. You cannot imbue the
                        official mind with the enthusiasm necessary to the carrying out of such
                        work, and this quality is needed quite as much as organisation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Barnardo adopted his own methods, and as his work grew, so did he extend
                        his operations till the institutions under his. control number something
                        like 70 or 80 at the present time, and embrace almost every phase of
                        philanthropic work for the poor and destitute while he is no doubt the
                        indirect cause of the establishment of many of the Homes which have been
                        established since he took up the rescue work 40 years ago. T. A.</p>

                        Mediterranean Sta- tion, where she was in the Reserve, will be com-
                        missioned with a nucleus crew under the new conditions at Chatham on the
                        17th prox. Her new duties will include that of tender of H.M.S.
                        "Andromache," R.N.R. drill-ship at Harwich. While on her late station the
                        "Dryad" frequently did guardship duty at Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>A number of the new short rifles have been issued to certain home battalions
                        for use with a view to making some changes in the manual exercise.</p>
                    <p>The expenditure of £2,500,000 in the manu- facture of 12-pounder and
                        18-pounder quick- firing guns for the re-armament of the Royal Horse
                        Artillery and the Royal Field Artillery batteries is about to be sanctioned.
                        There is no mistaking the voice of the nation in the matter. The British
                        horse and field artillery guns are lamentably behind those of other leading
                        armies, whereas formerly our batteries were foremost in everything. The new
                        quick- firers can be loaded much quicker than the old guns. The 17-pounder
                        can deliver twelve shots per minute. The manufacture of these guns is to be
                        proceeded with at once but it will be well into next year before any are
                        available for the home batteries, and the sum about to be sanctioned will be
                        spread over three years. The construction of the guns will be divided
                        between the Royal Arsenal, Wool- wich, Sir William Armstrong &amp; Co.,
                        Elswick, and Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim, Barrow-in-Furness.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir, As you have thought fit to insert, on Dec. 9, some personal
                            statements about myself and my friends, I trust you will allow me to
                            correct what has been said. My friend Mr. Montague (not Monk) Porch is
                            not an Egyptologist, but has worked solely on pre- historic man. I have
                            shared in his re- scarches while he was with me, and no ques- tion of
                            age or health has anything to do with the choice of subject of my
                            present work. His work lies in Egypt and not in Sinal, which he only
                            visited in passing. I have nothing what- ever to do with any search for
                            modern mines, or any commercial subject whatever. I am not in search of
                            malachite, and (so far as I know) none was ever exported from Sinai to
                            Alexandria, as the mines were exhausted 1,000 years before your city was
                            founded. No business of the kind could ever be started now, as there is
                            no malachite here in perceptible quantities, so far as is known. With
                            Russian malachite and Lake Superior copper in the market, it would be
                            maduess for anyone to come to Sinai for such a commercial purpose.</p>
                        <p>The turquoise company which failed here has wrought the most hideous
                            damage to the earliest historical monuments, which had last- ed
                            uninjured for six thousand years. And it is earnestly to be hoped that
                            no more savages in search of dividends will be let loose on this barren
                            peninsula.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,-In complaining of the impropriety of the paragraph in the Financial
                            Adviser's Note referring to the Hellenic community of Alex- andria in
                            connection with hashish smuggling, your correspondent "Anglo-Hellene"
                            falls in precisely the same error of judgment as the one he imputes to
                            the Adviser, for he unreserv- edly concurs with his assertion that "they
                            are no less interested than the Egyptian author- "ities in putting an
                            end to the present state "of things." I confess I fail to see why the
                            Hellenic community of Alexandria at all or any more than the Russian,
                            Italian, Austrian, etc., should be interested in seeing that the fellah
                            does not consume hashish; why should they be solicitous of the latter's
                            morals, or assume sackcloth, just because hashish smug- glers are mostly
                            lower class Greeks ? Are there no smugglers in other countries? no
                            poachers in England? Hashish smuggling, like any other smuggling, is a
                            public offence, the suppression of which can only concern the
                            authorities. At any rate it is certain that the Adviser could not have
                            meant to offend Hellenic susceptibilities, being too well known both for
                            his classical tastes and Hellenic sympathies as well as for his perfect
                            tact. Personally, I believe that far from intending the incriminated
                            state- ment as 'a plain hint,' the Financial Adviser, desired rather to
                            dwell on the unfairness of the opinion, which unfortunately seems to
                            prevail in some quarters, to the effect that the Hel- lenic community
                            are answerable for the smug- gling operations of some unworthy fellow-
                            countrymen of theirs-a nonsensical hypocrisy which the Financial Adviser
                            would never, I feel certain, countenance.</p>

                        <head>ANGLO-AMERICAN HOSPITAL.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir, Most earnestly is it to be hoped that the necessary funds will be
                            forthcoming to enable this admirable institution to continue its
                            philanthropie labours. "Medico" must surely be mistaken in asserting,
                            that such a hospital was not needed. The recent opening of a similar
                            establishment the Hutchinson Nurs ing Home in the Sharia Falaki,
                            furnishes cogent evidence that his views are not univers- ally accepted.
                            Being in the country, though within easy reach of the town, this
                            hospital possesses advantages which are superior to all the rest. The
                            highest medical authorities concur in recognising the important part
                            play ed by fresh air in the cure, of disease, and we ought all to be
                            grateful to the founders of the Anglo-American Hospital for having
                            selected a spot for its erection which fulfils every hygienic
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>I have been told, however, that the hospital is being extensively used,
                            for maternity cases, and that, too, gratuitously as respects the wives
                            of soldiers of the Army of Occupation According to my informant, there
                            were, during the past year, no less than fifteen such cases in the
                            hospital at one and the same time. If that statement be correct, it will
                            largely ac count for the hospital's present financial em- barrassment.
                            This, I think, is placing an un- fair burden upon its subscribers, and
                            especially upon those of non-English nationality. English and American
                            residents and visitors ought not to be asked to contribute for such a
                            purpose, but the charge should be borne by the British nation at large
                            out of moneys provided by Parliament for the maintenance of our military
                            establishment. Moreover, in my opinion, the Anglo-American Hospital
                            should be used exclusively for the treatment of disease, and some other
                            equally suitable locale should be found for a lying-in hospital.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,-May I be allowed to trespass on your pages for the purpose of
                            making known to your readers a wast which is 'daily be- coming more
                            serious,ough apparently un- suspected by the autho ties and by the Egyp
                            tian public in general. The rapid growth and Europeanising of the ton of
                            Assouan, together with the steadily increasing number of winter
                            visitors, make the subject one of almost univer sal importance. Cairo is
                            now adequately provided with hospitals and nursing homes, and it is
                            possible to get every necessity and even luxury for thie sick without
                            any abnormal expenditure; but in Assouan, crowded as it is during the
                            winter months with tourists, health or pleasure-seeking, employés,
                            servants and couriers, there is no hospital beyond a native one, and no
                            trained nurses to be had without telegraphing to Cairo, hich involves
                            immense expense and often conderable delay.</p>
                        <p>It is commonly asseted that none but the rich visit Assonan. Tis is
                            certainly a fallacy, but it is only too true that none but million-
                            aires can afford to bill there. Take as an example a case which occurred
                            last week. Immediately on her arrival from Cairo with her mistress, a
                            lady's-maid was taken danger- ously ill. After two or three days the
                            malady declared itself to be the most virulent form of typhoid fever,
                            upon which the patient was moved to the hospital. By the courtesy of the
                            Syrian doctor who is charge of the hospital, European patients may be
                            attended by their own physicians, but that is the only luxury vouchsafed
                            to them. In this particular in- stance a German woman, who had received
                            hospital training in Alexandria, was able, quite by chance, to undertake
                            the duties of nurse; but as no food was obtainable in the hospital all
                            her meals ad to be brought from outside, and when, after two days, the
                            English nurse arrived from Caro, she was utterly at sea with the native
                            attendants who speak and understand nothing but Arabic. The barest
                            necessities are unattainable. A jug of barley water was several hours in
                            coming, and when it did come, was undrinkable; the milk is more often
                            than not smoked; the simplest acces- sories are not forthcoming, and the
                            most indis- pensable hospital furniture is wanting. The room where the
                            patient is now lying in a critical state is cold and draughty, and has
                            neither fireplace nor heating appa- ratus; consequently the danger from
                            complications in the shape of bronchitis or lung trouble is
                            considerable.</p>
                        <p>This case, and the difficulties attending it, are now preoccupying the
                            minds of all the visit- ors and residents in Assouan. The interest is
                            undoubtedly not entirely disinterested, for each unit has a secret fear
                            lest such a calamity befall him too, and if he be not the fortunate
                            possessor of millions, the consideration of the pecuniary side of the
                            question will weigh with him almost as much as that of the discomfort
                            and danger. Doctors there are and to spare, but comfortable
                            accommodation for patients, and the attendance of a trained nurse, are
                            wants which cannot be passed over except by the most thoughtless d
                            improvident. The need is so great, and t remedy so simple,. that it is
                            astounding th no attempt should yet have been made to obviate the
                            difficulty. Two or three rooms permanently engaged and two resident
                            nurses are all that is required to begin with. A fund started for this
                            purpose would not remain long without subscribers. All the past,
                            present, and future visitors to As- souan would, I feel sure, bail the
                            motion with eagerness, an eagerness not ummingled with relief, and give
                            generously to a cause which they know only too well to be worthy of
                            their liberality.</p>

                        <p>Dear Sir,-A certain Cairo contemporary of yours recently reported on last
                            Saturday's Rugby Football match at the K.S.C., Ghezireh, Military v.
                            Civilians. It would make the newspapers of Egypt better reading, if they
                            all followed your estimable example and either reported matters
                            correctly or not at all. The score even in the above-quoted report was
                            incorrect, so that it is not strange that other details were most
                            meading. We are told that the Civilians strengthened their team by
                            drawing on well-known players from the British Recreation Club and from
                            the Railway Institute. This, I am afraid, shows gross ignorance on the
                            part of an English Editor, ot our national games, for when may we ask
                            have either of these admirable institutes given evidence other than that

                            been omitted but for some reason your contemporary went out of his way
                            to drag them in. It never follows that good Association men will make
                            good Rugby men, and often the reverse happens, but as a matter of fact
                            one of the Boulac men, though never having played Rugby before and
                            therefore far from strengthening the team-in- troducing a very risky
                            element into it,--this man played an excellent game and thoroughly
                            warranted the choice the captain made in selecting him. I allow that the
                            Railway Ad- ministration was well represented and that in the team were
                            certain men who are members of the Recreation Club, but. I allow no
                            more. The team was, in fact, representative of civilians of Cairo, of
                            the community at large. The score at the finish stood: Army 1 try,
                            Civilians 3 tries, and both teams played a good all-round game, the Army
                            showing up better in their three-quarters, while the Civilian's scrum
                            did much of the good work on their side. </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITER OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir, I should like to draw the attention of the authorits to a very
                            simple method of relieving, the availing congestion in the port of
                            Alexandria. The Egyptian Railway Admini- stration continually keeps one
                            or two- generally two-teamers discharging coal by the coal-hoistes.
                            These steamers can be discharged at the most in four days, but the
                            administrationeeps them there often for ten or twelve days, ccording to
                            the size of the ships. It would be quite easy for the adminis- tration,
                            instead of keeping the vessels there, to get them scharged at once, and
                            save expenses bymediately putting the coal straight into the trucks.
                            This would also be a great saving of labor and wages. To-day (Thursday),
                            1 example, there is a ship lying idle by the hosts. Only a part of her
                            cargo is discharged. Another steamer, the S.S. "Togo," has arrived and
                            as soon as the S.S. "Flaminian" is off, she will take the latter's place
                            and leave the merchants without berths.</p>

                    <head>CAUGHT BY THE GRIP. RELEASED BY PE-RU-NA. </head>
                    <p>"The world of medicine recognize Grip as epidemic catarrh."- Medical
                        Talk.</p>
                    <p>LA GRIPPE Is epidemic catarrh. It spares no class or nationally. The cultured
                        and the ignorant, the aristocrat and the pauper, the masses and the classes
                        are alike subject to la grippe. None are exempt—all are liable. </p>
                    <p>Have you the grip? Or, rather, has the grip got you? Grip is well named. The
                        original French term, la grippe, has been shortened by the busy American to
                        read "grip." Without intending to do so a new word has been coined that
                        exactly describes the case. As if some hideous giant with awful Grip had
                        clutched us In its fatal clasp. Men, women, children, whole towns and cities
                        are caught in the baneful grip of a terrible monster. </p>
                    <p>The following letters speak for them- selves as to the efficacy of Poruna in
                        cases of la grippe or Its after effects. </p>
                    <p>After Effects of La Grippe Eradicated by Pe-ru-na. </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Fred Weinberger, Westerlo, Albany County, N. Y., writes : </p>
                    <p>"Several years ago I had an attack of la grippe whiçh left my nerves in a
                        prostrated condition. Then I had another attack of la grippe which left, me
                        worse. I had tried three good physicians but all in vain. I gave Peruna a
                        trial. In a short time I was feeling better and now I am as well as
                        anyone."—Mrs. Fred Weinberger. </p>

                    <p>what it is, serving on public boards a number of times. He endorses Peruna in
                        the following words: </p>
                    <p>"I am 68 years old, am hale and hearty, and Peruna has helped me attain it.
                        Two years ago I had la grippe—my life was despaired of, Peruna saved me."-

                        has the honor of being third cousin to Abraham Lincoln. He writes: </p>
                    <p>"I had la grippe five times before using your medicine. Four years ago I
                        began the use of Peruna, since which time I have not been troubled with that
                        disease. I can now do as much work at my desk as I ever could in my life, I
                        have gained more than ten pounds in weight."—S. S. Lincoln. </p>

                    <p>"Last spring I suffered from la grippe and was partially cured but the bad
                        after effects remained through the summer and somehow I did not get strong
                        as I was before. One of my college friends who was visiting me asked me to
                        try Peruna and I did so and found it all and more than I had expected. It
                        not only cured me of the catarrh but restored me to perfect health, built up
                        the entire system and brought a happy feeling of buoyancy which I had not
                        known for years."—Alice M. Dressler. </p>

                        attack of grippe, which left a serious catarrhal condition of the throat and
                        head. </p>
                    <p>"Some one suggested Peruna. As a last resort, after wasting much time and
                        money on physicians, I tried the remedy faithfully, and In a few weeks was
                        as well as ever."—Jean Cowgill. </p>

                        did, and was immediately benefited and cured. The third bottle completed the

                    <head>UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION.</head>
                    <head>TELEGRAM FROM THEODORE PRICE.</head>
                    <p>The well-known Syrian capitalist of Alex- andria, Mr. George L. Sursock,
                        received the following telegram, of 578 words, despatched from New York on
                        Wednesday night by the celebrated American cotton manipulator, Mr. Theodore
                        Price. We publish the wire textu- ally:-</p>
                    <p>I believe this season's crop of American cotton to be 13,500,000 bales or
                        over. The Census returns show that up to the thirteenth of December 737
                        cotton-producing counties in the South had ginned, counting two round pales
                        as the equivalent of one square bale, 11,848,113 bales of cotton. The Census
                        De- partment further states that the requiring (sic) inreported counties had
                        ginned this season prior to November 14, 1904, 89,261 bales, counting round
                        bales as half-bales. A very conservative estimate of the total quantity they
                        have ginned this season up to December 13 is 100,000 bales, on which basis I
                        estimate therefore that all the counties in the cotton belt had ginned up to
                        the 13th of December this year 11,948,113 or practically 12,000,000 bales.
                        To this must be added the cotton picked and unpicked but not ginned on
                        December 13. Last season there were ginned after December 13, 1,324,885
                        bales and the season before last 1,725,442 bales. I believe that much more
                        remains to be ginned this year than in either of the two previous seasons,
                        hence my estimate of 13,500,000 bales or more. The theory that this amount
                        will not be marketed is of no im- portance. Cotton is grown to be sold and
                        it will not be destroyed. It will shortly be re- cognised that the crop is
                        not to be reckoned by port receipts and the stocks at thirty-one arbitrarily
                        selected interior towns. The cotton so coming into sight is for the most
                        part sold and is not a factor of depression. It is the unsold cotton in
                        first hands yet to find a market which will carry prices downward."</p>
                    <p>On the 13th of December the indicated quantity ginned was as above 12,000,000
                        bales; there were in sight 6,852,332 bales; there were ginned but not in
                        sight, therefore, 5,156,668 bales, to which must be added still to be ginned
                        at least 1,500,000 bales, or a total of 6,655,668 bales in farmers' hands
                        invisible and unsold on December 13. Such a situation is without a precedent
                        in the trade; it cannot but result in a prolonged and acute depression to
                        probably the lowest prices ever reached. The world's spinning trade,
                        impoverished by last year's corner, is without the resources or credit
                        requisite for the accumulation of large surplus sock. Even were it otherwise
                        it is not to be expected that manufacturers will be so lacking in commercial
                        sagacity as to buy large- ly at prices that are not yet even moderate when
                        considered in relation to conditions pre- sent and prospective.</p>
                    <p>A surplus at the end of the season of approximately 1,000,000 baies has
                        generally resulted. n seven-cent cotton at some time during the spring or
                        summer. A surplus of over 2,000,000 bales has only once existed, and the
                        price fell to 5 9/16 cents and did not advance above 6 cents for near- ly a
                        year. In my opinion the surplus supply over the most liberally estimated
                        consumption for this season will not be less than 2,500,000 bales. It makes
                        no difference whether it is visible or not; it will be on hand and must be
                        sold. Its selling will probably carry cotton to prices as low as the
                        prospective situation is unprecedented. On the facts any other conclusion is
                        illogical.</p>

                        MEETING.</head>
                    <p>The seventh ordinary general meeting of the Khedivial Mail Steamship and
                        Graving Dock Company (Limited) was held on the 22nd inst. at Winchester
                        House, Old Broad Street, London, Sir Auckland Colvin, the chairman,
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman moved, "That the report of the directors produced, together with
                        the annexed statement of the company's accounts at June 30, 1904, duly
                        audited, be now receiv- ed, approved, and adopted." He said :-When we had
                        the pleasure of meeting you, towards the end of last year, you will remember
                        that we were sum under the shadow of the cloud that came over us during the
                        winter of 1902-3. Owing to circumstances which, as you are aware, were
                        entirely beyond our control, that year left us with a debit balance, in
                        round figures, of no less than £31,500; but we then expressed our hope that
                        matters had resumed their normal course. The results of our opera- tions
                        have shown that the hope was justified, and although we cannot present them
                        with a dividend on the year s account, we think that our shareholders have
                        every reason to be satis- fied with the working during the year under
                        review, and with the fact that the above heavy loss is more than wiped
                        out-(hear,. hear). If the net profits for the year have proved satis
                        factory, it is, let me aud, in part because ex- penditure has been kept
                        within limits corres- ponding with those of the previous year, although the
                        volume of trade of all kinds has been very considerably in excess of the
                        pre- vious periods of comparison. Disappointed as some of you may be at not
                        receiving a dividend on the year's working, and glad as we should have been
                        to have paid you a dividend, the present state and prospect of our affairs
                        have, therefore, nothing in them to discage you. The heavy loss we sustained
                        1902-3 has been entirely removed. We carry forward a small balance of some
                        £2,200 into the present year: During the six months of the present year
                        which have nearly elapsed, our receipts have held up well; the general
                        health in Egypt and the neighbouring countries is good; and the pilgrimage
                        season has commenced under.conditions which promise to be not less favorable
                        than those of last year-(hear, hear). If, following the practice of
                        preceding years, do not enter into details with regard to our trading, let
                        me observe that, from a study of profit and loss account a general view of
                        the resuits for the year can be easily ascertained, and that in a company
                        like ours it is not in the interests of the shareholders to publish for
                        general information, whether in the report or in the chairman's speech,
                        details of the business. We shall, of course, be glad to give any
                        shareholder who may desire it all necessary information on application at
                        our central office. I mentioned last year that our board hoped to find some
                        fair and equitable means of issue from the difficulties which had arisen
                        with the Daira-i.e., with the administration of the private estate of his
                        Highness the Khedive. It was not to be expected that the Daira would part
                        with the right which had been adjudicated to it by the Court of Appeal of
                        the Mixed Tribunals without demanding a compensatory equivalent, but I am
                        glad to be able to inform you that our differences with his Highness have
                        been put an end to by our taking over two steamers from the Daira at a sum
                        mutually agreed upon, which sum included, further, consideration for all
                        rights which the Daira consented to forego, the Daira having bound itself,
                        in the terms of our agreement, in consideration of that sum wholly to
                        withdraw both now and in future from any further competition in our business
                        (hear, hear). The relations between ourselves <cb n="2"/> and his Highness
                        have, thus been replaced on a footing which is satisfactory to ourselves and
                        we trust not less agreeable to his Highness. (hear, hear). The accounts for
                        the dry dock in Alexandria are not yet finally closed, but the Egyptian
                        Government is in posses- sion of the dock, and when the minor opera- tions
                        necessary to complete its equipment and to place it in full working order
                        have been completed, the board hope to receive the small balance of the
                        purchase money still due to them, as well as any sum that may still be
                        outstanding on account of measures carried out by them on behalf of the
                        Government in connection with the completion of the dock. I may add that we
                        are given to understand that the dock will be open for traffic some time in
                        the course of the next year. Since the close of our year-that is, since June
                        30- our operations having been of a very satis- factory nature, as I have
                        already observed, and your directors being hopeful that the profits of the
                        current year will not suffer by comparison with those of the more
                        remunerative of the preceding years, they recently addressed themselves to
                        the Alexandria office to ascertain whether, in the opinion of the board in
                        Alex- andria, the present position and prospects for the rest of the current
                        year were such as would justity them in the payment of an ad interim
                        dividend. The reply received was such as to justify them in their opinion
                        and in the opinion of responsible advisers whom they consulted, in paying to
                        the shareholders an ad interim dividend for six months at the rate of 5 per
                        cent. Demum on the 31st of this month. The board have accordingly arranged
                        that this should be done, and they hope that no great time will elapse
                        betore the loss on the year 1902-3 has ceased to make itself felt. (hear,
                        hear). In conclusion, I may add that in, April last I made what has now
                        practically become an annual visit to Egypt, during which time, with the
                        valuable assistance of Mr. Francis Allen and Mr. John Reeves, I was enabled
                        to come to terms with the Khe dive's Dairá, as above explained, and to do my
                        utmost to further the interests of the company in other important
                        directions. I was also able during my stay thoroughly to satisfy myself, and
                        I have much pleasure in reporting to you that the company's name and credit
                        is thorough- ly well sustained, and is growing steadily, and that its local
                        representatives and their subor dinates, from the general manager, Mr.
                        H.F.C. Parkinson, downwards, are carrying out their duties in a manner which
                        deserves the thorough appreciation and approval of the shareholders. (hear,
                        hear). I expect in the course of the next month or two to be again in Egypt,
                        when I hope to be able to push a step further other projects which the
                        company has in view. (hear, hear).</p>

                    <p>Mr. Francis Allen seconded the resolution. Mr. H. B. Henley congratulated the
                        chair- man upon the very satisfactory arrangement made with the Daira, and
                        inquired if the transaction was completed in the accounts be- fore the
                        meeting, or was subsequent to June last?</p>
                    <p>The Chairman: It is a capital charge, and is embodied in the accounts to June
                        30. B The report and accounts were then adopted unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman moved, "That Mr. Francis Allen and Mr. J. R. Reeves, the
                        retiring directors, be re-elected directors of the com- pany.</p>

                    <p>Mr. W. Daddo seconded, and the resolution was adopted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henley moved a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors for the very
                        satisfactory report presented, especially with regard to the important
                        question that had been at issue be- tween them and his Highness the
                        Khedive." They all knew that Sir Auckland Colvin thoroughly understood the
                        question, and they were aware of the anxiety that it had caused their
                        chairman. The thanks of the share- holders were due to the directors for the
                        satis- factory way in which the dispute had ended. (cheers).</p>
                    <p>The vote of thanks was accorded by ac clamation.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman thanked the meeting in the name of the board for the vote of
                        thanks. They were quite right in attaching great importance to the question
                        now so happily closed, which he believed had left them on better relations
                        than ever with the Khedive, but he hoped that when the next report was
                        presented things would be in a still more satisfactory position.

                    <head>NEW CAIRO PERIODICAL</head>
                    <p>A bi-lingual fortnightly and illustrated periodical is to be issued by the
                        Church Missionary Society in Cairo from the commencement of the New Year.
                        Its chief and distinctive features will be that it will be published half in
                        English and half in Arabic, and that some of the articles in Euglish will be
                        printed in parallel columns in Arabic. The character of the periodical is to
                        be threefold, namely, religious, moral, and literary, and it is hoped that
                        it may help to supply a long- felt want in Egypt. The contents of the paper
                        will include:-</p>
                    <p>1. IN ENGLISH, summaries of addresses and debates for students on moral and
                        social subjects, held in English in Bait Arabi Pasha from time to time: also
                        meditations and devo- tional readings.</p>
                    <p>2. IN ENGLISH AND ARABIC, verbatim reports of papers read before students in
                        Cairo on various historical, descriptive, and ethical subjects treated both
                        from physiolo- gical and theological aspects; also illustrated articles
                        seriatim on the progress of civili- sation and Christianity in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>3. IN ARABIC, illustrated portions of the Gospels and the Old Testament (with
                        short explanations), which will afterwards be re- printed in pamphlet form
                        for distribution; also dialogues, and question and answer co- lumns upon
                        leading religious topics and diffi- culties; religious poetry, hymns,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>The price of the paper will be P.T. 1 per copy, or P.T. 20 per annum (plus
                        postage) to subscribers.</p>

                    <head>THE CORPORATION OF WESTERN EGYPT, LIMITED.</head>
                    <p>We have learned on the best authority that the above company has been duly
                        incorporated in the terms of the contract with the Government, and the
                        following are the officials of the new Corporation:</p>
                    <p>Directors: Hon. Alexander 0. Murray, Chairman of the Corporation, Sir William
                        Willcocks, K.C.M.G., Chairman of the Egyptian Board, Charles E. H. Hobhouse,
                        J.P., M.P., E. Manville, M.1.E.E., Hon. W. Turlough O'Brien, Crookshank
                        Pasha, M. L. Carton de Wiart. Bankers: Messrs. Glyn, Mills, Currie &amp; Co.
                        Consulting engineers: Kincaid, Waller, Man- ville and Dawson, Lake and
                        Currie. Solicitors: Ashurst, Morris, Crisp &amp; Co., Brokers: Lazenby Bros.
                        and Paine. Auditors: W. B. Peat &amp; Co We are credibly informed that the
                        whole of the share capital has been applied for and allotted.. A portion of
                        the shares have been fully paid, and on the whole of the balance 10s. has
                        been paid. The company, therefore, starts with considerably over a quarter
                        of a million in cash. According to the terms of the conces- sion, two-thirds
                        of the half-million remain for working capital. It will thus be seen that
                        the concessionaires have already fulfilled their part of the contract with
                        the Government, and anti- cipated the date by some six months, the 7th June,
                        1905, being the limit put in the conces- sion by the Governement for the
                        completion of these formalities.</p>
                    <p>The parental care of the Government has never been more fully shown than in
                        the granting of these concessions, for they have not only fixed the
                        capitalisation of the company and stipulated the amount of working capital,
                        but have also approved the wording of the Corpo- ration's Memorandum and
                        Articles of Associa- tion-consequently the public should be tho- roughly
                        satisfied.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that the railway survey, in charge of the well-known
                        engineers, Messrs. Kincaid, Wailer, Manville &amp; Dawson, will arrive here
                        in the first week in January, and the whole of the staff for boring
                        operations, in charge of Messrs. Lake &amp; Currie, will leave for the oases
                        at the same time. It is rumoured that the chairman of the Corporation, the
                        Hon. Alex- ander C. Murray, Master of Elibank, together with Mr. Charles E.
                        H. Hobhouse,, M.P., one. of the directors, accompanied by Mr. W. C.
                        Heaton-Armstrong, are coming here about the middle of January. We are not
                        surprised to learn that owing to the large demand there has been for the
                        shares of the Corporation, the directors have been compelled to issue let-
                        ters of regret, and to return many applications.</p>
