                    <head>ANTHROPOMETRY AND CRIME.</head>
                    <p> For many years past Lord Cromer, in his annual Reports, has directed
                        attention to the Anthropometric Bureau which was established in Egypt in
                        1896. The steady progress made in this direction is evidenced by the fact
                        that while in 1897, the year after the system was established, the number of
                        identifications by means of finger-prints was only 177, in 1904 it had
                        reached 1,405, the old practice of measuring criminals having been quite
                        superseded by the later and more effective plan of taking impressions of the
                        shape and markings of the fingers. It is however some- what disappointing to
                        be told, in spite of the many proofs given of the value of the new system,
                        that, in the words of Colonel Harvey in his latest report on the subject,
                        "some few judges refuse to allow any attempt to be made before them in court
                        in identifica tion by finger-prints." On this Lord Cromer remarks: "It is
                        indeed astonishing that some Egyptian judges are still reluctant to avail
                        themselves of the services of the Anthro- pometric Bureau. The
                        identification system is singular'y adapted for application in Egypt. It is
                        greatly to be hoped that, as it becomes more thoroughly understood, any
                        hesita- tion to employ it will pass away." One great advantage of its
                        practice is that although mainly useful in establishing the antece- dents of
                        habitual criminals, it has been the means on several occasions of preventing
                        gross miscarriages of justice. Of these one instance is given in the Report,
                        where a man about to be sentenced at Damanhour protested energe <cb n="6"/>

                        him. The case was adjourned for expert evidence, which, when given, proved
                        conclusively that the 27 antecedents belonged to a prisoner at Alexandria.
                        The judge him- self investigated the case, and on proceeding to Alexandria
                        satisfied himself that this was so, and was convinced of the value of the
                        system, as to which he had previously been sceptical. A case is under
                        investigation in England which, in all probability, will cause renewed
                        interest in this question of finger-markings. We must make very guarded
                        reference to this, as we have no right, even at this distance from home, to
                        write a word that would tend to prejudice a matter that is sub-judice, and
                        involves the lives of two men, but we can with perfect freedom mention a
                        piece of evidence given, before the magistrates on oath, by the inspector of
                        the Finger Print Depart ment at New Scotland Yard. This official stated that
                        in the department, to which he had been attached since it was originated,
                        the police possessed 90,000 sets of finger- prints. He had had ten years'
                        experience in comparing finger, prints, and the highest num- ber of points
                        of identity found to agree in finger prints of two individuals was three.
                        When there were four or more the finger-print was from the same person. In
                        answer to questions from counsel the inspector stated that the system had
                        been in force since 1895, and was called a science, adding that he was not
                        aware that in learned circles there was any controversy as to the
                        correctness of the theory, or that it was said by some to be a danger to the
                        public. It acted in two ways, for it fre quently enabled a man to establish
                        his in- nocence of charges, and to correct errors made in personal
                        recognition, while it helped to strengthen the cases against the guilty. He
                        had not yet found any case in which a mistake had been made through relying
                        on finger- prints. This testimony should help to trengthen the case for a
                        more complete adop tion of the system in Egypt, where it is noto- rious that
                        evidence on oath can be little relied ou, and where, therefore, a perfectly
                        reliable method of identification is all the more valuable.</p>
                    <p>While any new system that can in any way increase efficiency and accuracy in
                        criminal procedure should be heartily welcomed, a far larger question lies
                        in the background, and should be kept in view by all reformers, viz., that
                        of the treatment of criminals. More and more is it becoming recognised that
                        criminality is in the nature of a disease, and simply the exercise of
                        natural abilities and gifts in a wrong direction; that our present treatment
                        of criminals is calculated to harden their na- tares and to make them worse
                        rather than better; and that if we want to turn the offender into a
                        respectable member of society, we must alter our system of treatment root
                        and branch, and, abandoning the old lines of "vindicating the law," proceed
                        on a more reasonable and enlightened policy than that of "an eye for an eye,
                        a tooth for a tooth." The fact that finger- prints can be made to establish
                        a man's identity has been amply demonstrated, and it is but another proof
                        that the more we study our fellow man, the more we shall find out about him
                        and the distinctive features that reveal themselves the closer our observa-
                        tion goes. Supposing instead of one uniform system of treatment in
                        accordance with the class of offence committed, our prisoners, espe cially
                        the younger ones, were examined phrenologically, and that their capacities
                        were estimated (even if not exactly ascertained) by means of the many
                        physiological and psycho- logical sciences of the present day, and that a
                        system of treatment suited to their several characters was adopted, which
                        would give them a chance of taking the place in the community for which
                        these examinations showed them to be fitted, would not a great step have
                        been taken for the lasting benefit of humanity, one that must inevitably
                        result in good from the very first If we are told that the idea is Utopian,
                        we reply that it is our aim not merely to keep abreast of the times, but to
                        be in advance of them. The very subject upon which we have been writing
                        (finger-marks) was dealt with in fiction long before the idea took prac-
                        tical shape, for we remember reading a short, tale, published probably
                        twenty or twenty-five years ago, in which the leading incident was the
                        detection of a murder and robbery by means of a thumb mark made by the
                        perpe- trator, one of a large body of workmen, of whose thumbs impressions
                        were taken. And as the fiction of yesterday is the fact of to-day,</p>
                    <p>and the dream of to-day is the reality of to-morrow, so it is not by any
                        means idle to anticipate the reforms of the future, and to indicate the
                        directions in which we think they may be accomplished,</p>

                        upon the pigmies he was struck in quite an unwonted way. The first of them
                        that he beheld was a captive, some four feet high, "but more venerable than
                        the Memnonium of Thebes." Here was the oldest type of primeval man. Forty

                        Mediterranean. The extension of the projocted railway bejond Maau, an
                        Arabian town- 84 miles south coast of Jerusalem, is being carried out only
                        very slowly, while the important section of the line between Demand Haifa,
                        which is the real line of exit leading to the Mediterranean, has suffered
                        severely from inundations, and cannot be built as it was intended; while,
                        lastly, tho plan of laying down a branch line to Akaba, on the Red Sea, has
                        been giving up, greatly to the keen regret of a number of young and serious
                        officers in tho Turkish Army. The disorders in Yemon havo shown clearly the
                        great value of. such a linc/of railway leading southwards from Damascus\to
                        the Rod Sea, for it would facilitate the trans- port of troops of the Syrian
                        Army Corps into Arabia, and there would not be the dreary march across the
                        desert. </p>

                    <head>THE MARIOUT DISTURBANCES.</head>
                    <p>We have received tho following official statement as to. the recent
                        disturbances at Mariout on Sunday last.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Finance despatched last week a sarraf, Ghirghis Effendi by
                        name, to Mariout in order to draw up a report ou the ownership of some laud
                        and crops in the Amrieh district. On Sunday last tho sarraf was in that
                        neighbourhood when he saw a number of fellaheen attesting to get to some
                        land belonging to Bedouins. The latter barred their way and told them that
                        if they persisted they would fight The fellaheen replied that the laud
                        belonged to them, and a discussion ensued which led to blows.</p>
                    <p>The sarraf was merely a witness of the fight and was not hurt at all. The
                        omdeh and sheikh and one mounted police man were with the sarraf, and this
                        escort was sufficient to protect that official.</p>
                    <p>The policeman belonging to the escort, on witnessing the disturbance, redo
                        off to the markaz to inform tho mamour, who at once saddled and bridled and
                        galloped off to the scene of the trouble. Ho arrived on the spot scarcely an
                        hour after the beginning of the engagement. When he arrived on the scene of
                        action he found three fellaheen slightly wounded with bows from nabouts.
                        About 12 of the combatants were then arrested and charged with riotous
                        conduct. They have been sent to Alexandria for trial.</p>
                    <p>There are now 30 police officers and men in the Mariout district Eighteen
                        months age there was a total of only seven police officers and men there.
                        Patrols are mode daily, and the Bedouins are gradually getting to reaped law
                        and order.</p>

                    <head>THE MADHOUSE MEMORIAL.</head>
                    <p>The scheme for erecting a madhouse to the memory of Mohamed Aly is meeting
                        with some criticism. In the first place, the idea of a madhouse as a
                        memorial is some- what bizarre, and it may well be doubted whether this
                        project, however useful it may be, is suited to the dignity of the occasion.
                        Moreover, in view of the fact that the Government intend building a large
                        lunatic asylum in Lower Egypt between Alexandria and Tantah, as is announced
                        in Lord Cromer's last Report, subscribers are hesitating, as they ask
                        themselves what is tho utility of giving donations towards building an
                        asylum when the Government has already decided to build one. Supporters of
                        the scheme may reply that the madhouse which is to be built by the
                        Government will not be actually situated in Alexandria itself. But as this
                        asylum is to be built on the "Villa Colony" pattern, it is far bettor to
                        construct it in a rural district. We may quote the actual words of Lord
                        Cromer on tho subject :—</p>
                    <p>"I am glad to be able to report that there seems at last to be a fair
                        prospect of providing adequate accommodation for lunatics in this country.
                        In the first place, LE. 21,000 is to be spent during tho current year and in
                        1906, on inclosing 75 acres of desert land adjoining the present asylum, and
                        on adapting and enlarging an existing building, now used as an army hospital
                        for the use of lunatics. Thus the number of bods will be increased from 500
                        te 820. In the second place, the construction ol another large lunatic
                        asylum is under conside- ration. Plans are being prepared, but the site has
                        not yet been chosen. It will probably be situated somewhere between Tantah
                        and Alexandra. The type of the new asylum will be that known as the "Villa
                        Colony." Ian informed that this system has been tried with great success in
                        Germany, and that it is eminently suited to the Egyptian climate."</p>

                        <p>For some time past the Suez Canal Company have employed a large number
                            (some 800) of Arabs on the now dockyard and workshops which are in
                            coarse of construc- tion so the Asian shore of the harbour. Arab town

                            evening about 6 o'clock I frequently see this horde of somewhat unruly
                            characters, in bands of 50 to 100, land at tho main passenger jetty.
                            Last evening they landed at the Custom House as usual and went up the
                            main street (Rue de Commerce) shouting and laughing, much to the alarm
                            of many lady passengers who had come ashore from the P. &amp;0.
                            "Mongolia," and who, fearing some sort of riot, took refuge in shops and
                            hotels. -Seeing that coal coolies are not on any pretext allowed to
                            traverse main thoroughfares, it is generally thought that the police
                            might well include these frequently equally dirty crowds in the
                            regulations, and so avoid such scenes. The name of Port Said is none so
                            good, though much improved, that this state of things can be allowed to

                        <p>The Appeal Court of the Mixed Tribunals gave judgment in the case of
                            Stagni v. Selinas on the 3rd inst, and as our readers are aware, the
                            text of this judgment appeared in full in our columns a few days ago.
                            Mr. Salinm, the well-known Alexandria stockbroker, won the case both in
                            the Mixed Court of 1st Instance and in the Appeal Court But both Mr.
                            Luigi Stagni and Mr. Salinas are Italian subjects, and the same case has
                            also pi-.es before the Italian Consular Courts and to the Appeal Court
                            at Ancona, where judgment was given in favor of Mr. Luigi Stagni. This
                            gentleman has naturally decided to abide by the decision of the court
                            which gave judgment in his favor, and two days ago levied an execution
                            on the furniture of Mr. Salinas, although the latter is the successful
                            suitor according to the Mixed Courts. Wo do not call to mind a more
                            striking instance of the conflict of jurisdictions prevailing in

                        <p>"A Native Landowner" (Helouan) writes:— Some merchants at Alexandria have
                            arranged a "corner" in May cotton and have artificially raised the price
                            by two dollars within the last three days. The price of May cotton is
                            now 15 3/4 dollars, while last Saturday it was only 13 3/4 dollars. What
                            is very strange is that while cotton is abundant in Alexandria, and
                            there is one hundred thousand cantars more than last year at this time,
                            still cotton at Alexandria is four dollars dearer than at Liverpool. Is

                    <p>London May 5 Awaiting the events ! The very largeness of the impending
                        struggle belittles all else. Mean time, rumors of peace negotiations are
                        persist- ent but no one knows through what channel they come. Hope is
                        perhaps "father to, the thought" that the Tsar may still have a grain of
                        sense left, and may use the factor of doubt yet remaining to obtain some
                        kind of terms. As yet there is no sign of activity in stock markets, and
                        moreover, there is little induce- ment to lead to an increase of public
                        business the position in the Far East being no clearer than it was a week
                        ago, though the somewhat strained feeling in European diplomatic circles as
                        reflected in financial circles seems to have almost passed away.</p>
                    <p>Japanese stocks have hardened a little, especially the new 4 1/2 per cent
                        issue, the special settlement in which took place today, Consols are dull,
                        and dealers in all quarters seem anxious to avoid having any position open,
                        until the horizon is clearer.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks are steady, but inactive. Daira Sanieh shares are a trifle
                        lower at 285/8, ex a dividend of 3s.; and Bank shares are unchanged. In the
                        mining section the tone is dull. The market at the moment is a neglected
                        one, and suffers, in company with Booth Africans, from sheer want of
                        business. Specu- latively—i.e. for any intermediate improvement -there is
                        nothing tempting about this market, but, to take op and put away, prices are
                        near, if they have not already reached, a cheap leveL</p>
