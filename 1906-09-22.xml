                        colours. Mr. 'Edgar: Speyer has had the hardihood to .reconimend in his
                        minority report that directors. who have neg- lected their duties should be
                        held- responsible 'to the shareholders. As the law étands at "present the
                        diréctor who entirely neglects to attend-meetings is exonerated from the
                        result of his neglect, and companies come to'grief in ' large numbers
                        without the "guinea-pigs" pegs rolled in thé mud as they. deserve to be. .
                        'There is no doubt'that the oj pprobrium of failure is that which compels,
                        individual traders' to be careful and diligent, and that the absence of'
                        blame in 'the case of directors. is produetive of extravagance and reckless
                        management. Mr. Speyer points out. that in Germany management is much more
                        intelligent 'because directora are held liable for neglect and
                        mismanggement, Asa matter 4 vf. fact, English companies are better managed

                        of its past, and ideas of the fature of the business, and he as a rule

                        .In.some cases. there is no doubt the 'system has worked well. Directors who
                        are ignorant of the business in hand may 'easily , wréck .@ company by

                            golden wedding, was born on the 29th September 1826. He succeeded his
                            father as Regent in 1852, to the exclusion of his elder brother Louis,
                            who was mentally incapable of governing. He spent much of his energy in
                            continuous struggles with the ecclesiastical power and at the end of
                            1855 he banished the Jesuits from the duchy. In the following year he
                            narrowly escapel assassination. He assumed the title of Grand Duke in
                            September 1856 and on the 20th of that month married the daughter of the
                            Emperor William of Germany. He was an ardent advocate of German unity
                            and became an ally of Prussia in the Franco-German War, in which the
                            Badenese contributed in no small degree to the success of the German
                            arms, thereby making themselves extremely unpopular with their former
                            Alsatian friends and neighbours. He was one of the first to accept the
                            constitation of the new German Empire and warmly acclaimed the new
                            Emperor at Versailles. In i981 he was seriously ill and for a year Baden

                        against the British Occupation during the Akaba crisis, have now again been
                        suspected of resuming similar proceedings. The Cairo Gouvernorat has issued
                        a warning to this society in reference to its course of action, and, if it
                        is persisted in, strict measures will be taken.</p>
                    <p>All the Nationalist Press of Egypt give great prominence to Mr. Wilfrid
                        Blunt's extraordinarily bitter attack on Lord Cromer and the Anglo-Egyptian
                        Administration, which he has embodied in his work entitled "The Atrocities
                        of Justice under British Administration in Egypt." The astonishing spectacle
                        of a well-known Englishman coming forward to bespatter with invective the
                        work of England in Egypt is much relished by all the Pan-Islamic Press and
                        consequently the greatest publicity is being given to the pamphlet in order
                        to arouse all the latent fanaticism of the populace. The most violent among
                        the vernacular newspapers have found a useful ally in their Anglophobe
                        campaign, for Mustapha Pasha Kamel and his journalistic compeers have never
                        excelled Mr. Wilfrid Blunt in the terrible vehemence of that gentleman's
                        attacks on our administration of this country.</p>

                    <head>THE TURKISH SUCCESSION.<lb/>AN ACUTE SITUATION.</head>
                    <p>The question of the succession to the Throne of Turkey threatens to become
                        acute. </p>
                    <p>A few days ago, says a contemporary, Abdul Hamid held a private council at
                        the Palace. There were present the Grand Vizier, the Sheik-ul-Islam, Izzet
                        Pashs (the Sultan's Second Secretary), as well as the Ministers of War,
                        Marine, Foreign Affairs, the Interior, and "Pious Foundations." In spite of
                        the insistence of Izzet Pasha, the Council came to the conclusion that
                        before it was definitely decided to modify the legal order of succession to
                        the Throne, the whole question should be subjected to prolonged and mature
                        inquiry.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless the Sultan, at the instigation of Izzet Pasha and Fehim Pasha,
                        has determined the moment that the state of his health is beyond hope of
                        recovery, to summon to Yildiz Kiosk the heir presumptive, Reshad Effendi and
                        Prince Youssouf Izzeddin, who is twelfth in the legal succession, and there
                        shut them up in close confinement. Meanwhile Prince Barhaneddin, who is
                        Abdul Hamid's son, will be proclaimed Prince Regent until the death of his
                        father, and, afterwards, the real Sovereign of Turkey.</p>
                    <p>Izzet Pasha, who, with certain others, instigated the Armenian massacres and,
                        still more recently, was the evil genius of the Sultan in the Tabah affair,
                        is using every means, in concert with those in immediate attendance on the
                        Sultan, to dissuade him from postponing to his last moments the carrying out
                        of this coup d'état.</p>
                    <p>The Liberal Ottoman Committee of Union and of Progress, sitting in Paris, has
                        launched in these last few days a manifesto on the subject, exhorting every
                        Ottoman to offer the most strenuous resistance to the realisation of this
                        scheme of Abdul Hamid's to rob the presumptive heir, Reshad Effendi, of bis
                        legitimate rights in favour of Prince Barbaneddin. </p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped, both for the happiness of all the races of Tarkey and, for
                        the peace of Europe, that at least one or other of the Great Powers, without
                        delay and before they are faced with the accomplished fact, will let its
                        voice be heard at Constantinople, and, if only in the interests of humanity
                        and civilisation, will insist on the strict observance of the laws and
                        customs governing the succession to the Turkish Throne.</p>
                    <p>The health of Abdul Hamid, who is suffering from cancer, gives rise to
                        increasing anxiety among his attendants.</p>

                    <head>A SERIOUS AFFAIR.<lb/>NATIVE KILLED BY A POLICEMAN.</head>
                    <p>Great excitement was occasioned in the Labban quarter of Alexandria yesterday
                        evening by the death of a native who was killed by an onbashi of police, and
                        it was feared at one stage of the scene so caused that a riot would ensue,
                        but happily the affair ended without serious disturbance.</p>
                    <p>The details of the case are particularly revolting, and the charge, of
                        course, gains in gravity from the fact that the death of the victim was due
                        to the inexcusable action of a non-commissioned officer of police, who is
                        now under arrest. The facts of the case, in so far as, we have been able to
                        learn them, are as follows:– </p>
                    <p>Having heard that a quarrel took place between his son and a native grocer's
                        son in the Labbane quarter of Alexandria a native shawish attached to the
                        Labban caracol went to intervene, accompanied by an Italian ombashi, Di
                        Natalli by name.</p>
                    <p>A certain Osman Ahmed was sitting in front of the grocer's shop when the
                        Italian policemen arrived and tried to arrest the grocer's son. Osman, who
                        was a witness of the quarrel, said to the policeman, "the grocer's son did
                        no wrong and it was your son who attacked him, and I am ready to give my
                        evidence to that effect."</p>
                    <p>The onbashi and the shawish were greatly enraged by Osman's assertion and
                        poured forth a torrent of abuse, and the three of them then went to the
                        caracol. There the shawish asked Osman if he was really going to give
                        evidence against his son, saying in Arabic Bardo aiz tishhad? "Yes. of
                        course," was the reply. After farther abusive language had been exchanged
                        between the three, the two policemen attacked Osman. The shawish gave him a
                        severe blow on the left side of the chest and the onbashi kicked him in the
                        lower part of the abdomen. The man fell to the ground and died almost
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>El Kaimakam Cobbe Bey, acting Hakemdar, and Haddayé Bey, Mamour of the Public
                        Security Department, hastened to the caracol to open an inquiry, but up to
                        the present, we have no information of its results. This morning the body
                        was taken to hospital for the holding of a post-mortem examination.</p>
                    <p>When news of the unfortunate man's terrible death reached the streets the
                        people collected in numbers in front of the caracol, many trying to force
                        their way in, but happily they were held back by the police and trouble was
                        averted.</p>
                    <p>The following is the report that was given to the Press this morning by the
                        Gouvernorat:-</p>
                    <p>'Osman Ahmed, a native of Alexandria, who was summoned yesterday to give
                        witness regarding a quarrel at the Labban Police station suddenly fell down
                        dead in the caracol. The body was taken to the hospital for post mortem
                        examination."</p>
                    <p>That such meagre details should be officially furnished to the Press is
                        exceedingly regrettable, and we can see no reason for the authorities to
                        keep such a remarkable silence over the affair, as they must necessarily
                        have been in possession of important details, the publication of which could
                        in no way affect the subsequent proceedings.</p>

                    <head>TOTEMISM IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Much important information which the Egyptologist should not miss is included
                        in M. Victor Loret's Musée Guimet lecture on "L'Egypte au Temps da
                        Totémisme." Although one finds it very hard to believe that the objects in
                        the Negadah vase-paintings are not galley, but stockaded villages, and that
                        the neter sign is not an axe, bnt an ensign, these are not very essential
                        parts of his theory, which is, bric fly, that the gods of the Egyptians were
                        the totems of the different Egyptian clans before they were worshipped as
                        gods. The theory, which is set forth with all M. Loret's ac: customed skill
                        and wealth of illustration, has much to recommend it, and would certainly
                        explain that worship of animals which ever since Roman times has formed one
                        of the standing puzzles of Egyptian religion. The examples which he takes
                        from the so-called slate "palettes" and other relics of arobaio times are
                        convincing enough; but he is not altogether so satisfactory when he comes to
                        define the meaning of "totem." To speak of the emblem as a "signe de
                        ralliement" and an "attribut ethnique" does not take us the whole way,
                        unless he can explain why one olan should choose one emblem, and another,
                        another. It is easy, to understand, for instance, why the royal tribe should
                        call itself "the Hawks" and another "the Elepharts," and such names can be
                        paralleled by the usage of Red Indians and other races. But why should any
                        body of men call themselves the "Tresses of Hair" or the "Crossed Arrows,"
                        as according to M. Loret's theory, two of the Egyptian tribes must have
                        done? An opponent of the totemistic theory of religion might sore'y reply
                        that it was because the tribe worshipped, for other reasons, gods of whom
                        the objects in question were, for some reason or another, the emblems, that
                        they gathered under their banners, in the way that we hear under Rameses II,
                        of a Regiment of Amen, a Regiment of Ptab, and the like. Yet the longer one
                        studies M. Loret's theory, the more interesting and probable does it
                        become.</p>

                        <p>The Turkish papers publish summaries of the speeches delivered at the
                            inauguration of the Maan-Tabouk section of the Hedjaz Railway. General
                            Rahmi Pasha, who represented H.I.M. the Sultan at the ceremony,
                            delivered an elequent speech and dwelt lengthily upon the importance
                            from every point of view of the Hedjaz Railway, which will so greatly
                            facilitate the pilgrimage to Medina. The line traverses country through
                            which the Prophet journeyed in days of old, said the General, and it
                            will lead to the welfare and prosperity of the whole of Arabia--the
                            desert will be transformed into a fertile oasis. The success of the
                            undertaking is enhanced by the fact that the railway is being built
                            under the greatest difficulties which Divine Providence helps to
                            overcome.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND TURKEY.</head>
                    <p>In Wednesday's issue we made some comments in our leading article on certain
                        statements made in our selections from the article on England and Germany in
                        Turkey, which appears in the current number of the "Contemporary Review."
                        The article is very interesting and we advise our readers to peruse it in
                        toto. For those, who may be unable to obtain this issue of the
                        "Contemporary" we append the following further extracts, which are of
                        considerable local interest :-</p>
                    <p>Germany is still supported in Turkey by the Palace party, and by no one else.
                        The likings and the hopes of the mass of the population, so far as they
                        think and hope, are turned to England. When, in the recent crisis over the
                        Egyptian frontier question, it was expected that the English ships were to
                        seize some part of Turkish territory, a Turk of high rank and long
                        experience, said in conversation, "If the English ships come, I believe that
                        the Turks here will rise in a body and entreat them to remain." Many people
                        in Turkey, and, not least, a considerable body of the more educated
                        Mohamedans, openly expressed the wish that the Sultan might stand firm and
                        make no concession, and the hope that strong action on the part of England
                        might ensue, for the opportunity was favourable to England in such a degree
                        as might not occur again; and probably no one doubts that, if the Sultan had
                        received even slight encouragement from any important quarter, or if England
                        had made any concession from the terms of the Ultimatum, he would have
                        refused to withdraw his troops. It was said quite freely in Constantinople,
                        as the Ultimatum was approaching its term, that English officials there had
                        urged the English Government to make some small concessione, in order to
                        open a more graceful way of retreat for the Sultan, and the prophecy was
                        repeatedly made in my hearing, hopefully by some, anxiously by others, that
                        any concession would precipitate a conflict. There was, however, a general
                        feeling of relief, even among the most bellicose, when it was whispered one
                        morning, at the expiry of the term allowed in the Ultimatum, that on the
                        previous night at eleven o'clock a telegram from London had intimated the
                        resolve of England to made no concession, and that the British Ambassador
                        had in person carried this message to the Palace at that late hour, and
                        allowed twelve hours more for deliberation, whereupon the Council had sat
                        till four o'clock in the morning. I do not mean to assert that these were
                        the exact facts as they really occured. These were the reports current in
                        well-informed ciroles and generally believed.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir, To those who remember Cairo
                            before the great Pyramid was accurately measured inside and out, when
                            the great explorers rode there on donkey back, and camped for their
                            serious work in the adjoining cave tombs, the change to an electric
                            tramway and luxurious modern Hotel is very striking. But all signs of
                            progress and civilization vanish as soon as the Pyramids are entered,
                            and visitors can only examine their grim interiors with candles in hand,
                            supported by two perspiring men, and at the risk of their necks. Perish
                            the thought of antiquarian research. These monuments, however, are no
                            longer the hunting grounds of Arab Sheikhs, and the vampires of
                            bakshish. It ought not to be difficult at the present day for the
                            department of Egyptian Antiquities to clear the passages of dirt and
                            sand, and introduce electric lighting, which is installed close by, and,
                            more important still, to lay down in the interior passages specially
                            designed handrails, and ladders, such as are provided in engine rooms,
                            to give access without interfering with a view of any feature. Those
                            should be made of gun-metal; and no doubt it would be possible to secure
                            them in position by clamping, and without boring holes in the priceless
                            masonry.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Sir,-In a remarkable article
                            appearing in the "Egyptian Morning News" of to-day "Bernie" says in
                            reference to the Denishwai Case: "As men on the spot, and having heard
                            all the evidence in connection with the case we were entitled and still
                            are in the absence of rebutting testimony to give an expression of
                            opinion worthy of weight (sic) vis-a-vis with the parlour journalists
                            who only sit and wait for an ex parte report."</p>
                        <p>I would merely ask whether "Bernie" was on the spot, and if so why full
                            accounts did not appear in the "Egyptian Morning News." Would "Bernie"
                            care to publish what space was given in the English portion of that
                            paper to the account of the Denishwai trial other than those portions
                            copied word for word from the "Egyptian Gazette" and written by

                        <head>OFFICIALS AND CIVILIANS.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE' Sir,-Having noticed the
                            correspondence in your estimable journal about National Anthems and the
                            charge of "A 20 years Resident," against civilian Englishmen, as if they
                            were all Government officials, it has occurred to me that perhaps he has
                            been mistaken in the matter and that the delinquents were most probably
                            some of the unofficial class who like to pose for what they are not, and
                            in thinking how to prevent this it has occurred to me that the best
                            means would be for every Englishman in the Government service to wear
                            some distinguishing badge so that no mistake can possibly be made
                            between the two categories, and as I can well remember that during the
                            reign of the late Khedive Ismail Pasha it was considered an honour for
                            Europeans to wear the tarbush and stambouline, as a distinguishing mark
                            of the superiority of the Government functionary, that it might be a
                            good thing if every one of the Englishmen who draw their pay from the
                            Egyptian Government were to wear the headdress of the country.</p>
                        <p>They all engage to wear the tarbush, and do so, in their office, when
                            earning their pay, and if they were to continue its use in the evening,
                            it would prevent their being classed with, and often taken for the
                            common herd of commercial people that are now flocking in Cairo, and are
                            to be seen when the entertainments are gratis or nearly so. It would
                            have another advantage as the powers that be could immediately
                            distinguish a man who committed an act of discourtesy, or want of tact,
                            and see whether it was or was not an official. And I feel sure that the
                            above charges could never be made against any of the former who are
                            always so willing to show their loyalty to the Head of the State that
                            employs them.</p>
                        <p>The British Officers in the Egyptian Army wear their tarbushes after 8
                            p.m. and very becoming they look; why therefore should not the civilian
                            English Officials follow their example, and thus avoid being taken for
                            the persons above mentioned. The tarbush has an advantage over the hat
                            by being very comfortable to the head, inexpensive, easily stowed away
                            when indoors, and kept on the head in a gale of wind.</p>
                        <p>I have often been amused to see the imitation Englishmen (Levantines of
                            various sorts) being saluted by Cairo policemen because they have taken
                            to the straw hat and wear their trousers turned up at the bottoms and
                            with a fly whisk in their hands pose for what they are not.</p>
