                        a large Greek element, and while the Anglican Pro testant Church and the
                        Latin Cburcbea gener ally celebrate the birth of Christ on December 2ôth,
                        the Greek and Eastern Cburcbea defer their celebration till the 7th of
                        January—the period of the Epiphany. Consequently we get in Egypt two

                        all kinds in that world's centre.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to study the early records of the obeervanoe of Christmas
                        Day. In a previous Christmas article we showed that its origin was
                        distinctly pagan and quite unoon uected with the birth of Jesus Christ
                        Indeed many early writers hold that it was s special providence that
                        appointed the birth of Christ to take place in the midst of pagan festivals.
                        Menander gives a long account of them, and considers that a festival held on
                        the shortest day-the winter solstice—presented the opportunity of a
                        transition to the Christian point of view , Christ, the sun of the spiritual
                        world, beiug compared with the sun ot the amtenal world. The comparison was
                        carried still further, for as in the material world it is after dark ness
                        has reached its highest point that the end of its domiuion is already near,
                        and the light begins to acquire freeh powet, eo, too, in the spiritual world
                        Christ, tbt spinteal eon, must appear to make an end of the kingdom of
                        darkness But the date to be observed presented a difficulty, and while the
                        Western Churches decided on the 25th December, the Eastern Cburcoes deferred
                        it till the Epiphany. Heoce the difference of dates at the preeeot time.

                        Coupled with these, no doubt, in the minds of many Englishmen resident in
                        Egypt, is the regret that they cannot be in the old country "to put their

                        existing assets and liabilities of the branch and loses £880or the sale.</p>
                    <p>The land at Rod el Farag was purchased with a view of erecting larger maun

                        present state of finances they propose selling this land at the first
                        favourable opportunity, at an estimated depreciation of £9,000 The loss on
                        the building contract at San Stefano amount* to £1895, due to tbe injudi
                        cious technical supervision , the company adds that this loss brought about

                        expenses has been written ofl, as it was felt that the gradual extention of
                        this sum would reuder the payments of dividends impossible for years</p>

                        Lord Vivian had obtained a divorce from his wife owing to her having
                        committed adultery with Mr Alfred Curphey, th* well known Anglo Egyptian
                        financier The case came be fore Mr Justice Bergrade last Tuesday. The
                        detail* are as follows :—</p>
                    <p>His lordship gTSLted a decree nisi to the Right Hoo George C'reapigny
                        Brabaion, Baron Vivian, on the ground of the misoooduot of his wife, Barbara

                        defense.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rayford said Lord and Lady Vivian were married at St Michael'*, Pimlioo,
                        in August* 1603, and lived at North Audley street. The married life for a
                        time was a happy one There were two children In 1906 the petitioner went to
                        Canada, and on his return, in October, oc d (ÿlrred the first real trouble,
                        because be found a (hat hi* wife had arranged to take part in some
                        theatricals at the Royalty Theatre He object ed, and finally per*uaded her
                        to give up the idea</p>
                    <p>The following winter they arranged to go to Cairo, and then on a shooting
                        expedition Be fore going, however, the petitioner spoke to his wife about
                        tbe co respondent, whose acqu aintonce *he had made in Cairo Lord Vivian had
                        got to know something about the oo respondent, and felt he was not a
                        desirable person for hi* wife to know. The petitioner mentioned the matter
                        to Lady Vivian before departing for the shoot in the neighbourhood of
                        Khartoum On his ret urn to Cairo Lord Vivian found that his wife had made
                        the aeqas in tance of tbe co respondent and some of the latter's friend*, to
                        whom the petitioner strongly objected </p>
                    <p>Subsequently I^idy Vivian told her husband that she had arranged to go on a
                        motor tour through France, but when he found that the co-respondent was to
                        be one of the party he objected, and told the co respondent that Lady Vivian
                        would not be one ot the party In the end there was no motor party, and the
                        peti tioner and hi* wife retained home</p>
                    <p>The co-respondent and some of his friends shortly afterwards returned to
                        England, and Lady Vivian was constantly going about to different places, and
                        would have nothing to' do with her husband In tact (said counsel', from the
                        time Lord Vivian returned from the shooting axpedition Iiady Vivian refused
                        to live with him as hi* wife In Apnl last she left her husband s house,
                        intimating that she would not return Lord Vivian had made every endeavour to
                        get his wife to return *nd give up the co-respondent</p>
                    <p>On one occcasion Lord Vivian went and saw hi» wire at the Coburg Hotel, where
                        she was staying, and promised to forgive her if she would return But she
                        absolutely declined his offer, and left the hotel in a motor-car Sub-
                        sequently, it was ascertained that she was constantly in the society of the
                        oarespondent in the Isle of Man, and with whom she stayed at the Boston
                        Hotel on the night of October 25 last.</p>
                    <p>Lord Vivian, in his evidence, corroborating counsel's statement, said that
                        after the shoot ing expedition near Khsrtcnm his wife refused to live with
                        him an his wife</p>
                    <p>His Lordship: What was the reason? — She refused, saying she did not wish
                        it.</p>
                    <p>His lordship inquired who the co respondent wn*, and counsel said he believed
                        him to lie a man of considerable wealth, who lived in the Isle of Man, and
                        spent a great deal of his time at Cairo</p>
                    <p>Other evidence was called, and a decree nisi, with cost», and the custody ot

                    <p>LES FILS DE R. PICARD V. JACQUES MISRAHI AND OTHERS</p>
                    <p>This was a dispute concerning some goods parebased by the Defendants and sums
                        of money alleged to be due therefor. Maitre Morpurgo for the Plaintiffs
                        claimed payment of £E. 100 in lieu of the £E. 7.500 admitted by the
                        Defendants. A safe sold to the latter by his clients, to be paid for in
                        monthly ins. talmente, was still in the defendants' sbop, the Plaintiffs
                        having been unable to remove it as the door was too narrow (Laughter). His
                        clients were claiming the remaining instalident of the price of this safe.
                        Maitre Nahas, who appeared for the Defendants, contended that the safe was
                        an old one and that his clients were willing to pay what was just, adding
                        that certain other goods belonging to the Defendants and beld "en dépôt" by
                        the Plaintifts were amply sufficient to cover his clients indebtedness to
                        M.M Picard. This Maitre Morpurgo disputed, pointing out that the pledges
                        aforesaid had already been forfeited and sold by the buissier of the Court.
                        Judgement was deferred for a week.</p>

                    <p>In the matter of the Concordat Preventif sought by the above named debtor,
                        Maitre Terrante representing Messrs. Sebutz and Payer the principal
                        creditors, alleged had faith on the part of the applicant, pointing out as a
                        curious rirenmstance that the registers producel shered all the entries for
                        two years past to have been written by the same hand, and | further
                        complaining of the delay in putting in the account Maitre Biggiavi said bis
                        client (the debtor) would require time to settle the account with Messrs.
                        Schutz and Payer. Dacrour was ooly a small trader and, although not legally
                        entitled to a concordat, his bills having been protested be appealed to the
                        Court to sbew a little indulgence, as was usual both in Egypt and in Italy.
                        Schutz, in fact, controlled the committee of creditors the other two members
                        being his nominees. The registers would be seen to be genuine on inspection;
                        their age was apparent. Moreover, be added, the bills produced did not
                        correspond with the bankrupts' re gister, Schutz had only been a creditor
                        since 1905.</p>
                    <p>CORRIER v. AUTO GARAGES AND AUTO-CABS CO.</p>
                    <p>This was an action for compensation by the Plaintiff who alleged that he had
                        been dismissed from the Company's service with inadequate compensation.
                        Maitre Manu sardi, for the Company,contended that the Plaintiff bad been
                        fairly treated by his clients; and that, although he had given trouble in
                        refusing to obey orders, and had cansed a strike of employés, the Company
                        bad offered to retain him in its service on his signing a document and
                        promising to conform, to its wishes in future. This he refused to do unless
                        the manager were dismissed. So lately as last October the Company again
                        offered to take back the Plaintiff if he would promise to obey orders as
                        other employés did, especially with regard to the control of the entrance to
                        the garage, in fact he was to con form to his original agreement of February
                        1905. Five days were allowed him in which to | reply, failing which he was
                        taken to bave defi nitely resigned He therefore, said comsel, was only
                        entitled to his salary for the three months ending on September 30. 1907,
                        viz, L.E. 300, instead of the L.E. 500 now claimed. The work bad to be
                        carried on somebow and accordingly his post had since been filled np. Maitre
                        Oriel for the Plaintiff urged that the weakness of the Company's case was
                        shown by the fact that Mr. Galli, a director, had in July (while the dispute
                        was pending) offered Mr Corrier L.E. 20 out of his own pocket, in addition t
                        L.E. 60 put forward by the Company as an indemnity. His client might bave
                        been a little hasty in his language towards the Company, but certainly not
                        impolite, as alleged. On October 30 he was ready to make reparation if the
                        Defendants would take him back. Corrier bad resigned a good position in
                        Paris to come to them, and had now lost 6 months' work and salary amounting
                        to L E 120. He was justified in asking for a large indemnity since the 2
                        years' contract bad been broken. This closed the case, and judgment was
                        deferred for a fortnight</p>

                        which is well known as an importer of coal into Alex Andria. It is
                        registered in accordance with English law, and has &amp; capital of
                        £20,000), divided into 4,000 shares of £5 each. Objects Transport by towing
                        of coal and other mer chandise between Port Said and Cairo, either through
                        the Suez Canal or the lsinailia fresh water canal. The advantages of this
                        Lew route are numerous. There will be no trans shipment in regard to the
                        land transport, and the Capital will thus be in direct cominunication by
                        water with Port Said. Material required by the new company is now under
                        construction in Eng land, and the new service will be inaugurated in April
                        next. The rates of freight will be the sane as those now in force on the

                    <p>A NEW STERNWHEELER</p>
                    <p>A new stern wheel steamer, built by the Sudan Development and Bxploration
                        Company, Limited to the order of the Repression of Slavery Department, was
                        successfully launched on Saturday afternoon, the 14th. December, at the
                        Company's Workshops, Khartoum North. Owing to the limited time at the
                        disposal of the builders for the completion of the vessel, no othcial
                        ceremony was arranged, as it was essential that the boat should take the
                        water immediately the last rivet had been put in place At the request of
                        Captain McMurdo, the Director of the Slave Trade Repressjon Depart ment,Mrs
                        Asser, wife of the Adjutant. General, Egyptian Army, graciously performed
                        the informal ceremony of christening the vessel. The following were also
                        present ;-Colonel and Mrs. Hunter, Colonel Asser, Mr. and Mrs. More, Mr. and
                        Mrs. Harcourt Paine, Mrs. Cross, Mr. Norman Wilkinson, Mr. Harold F. Hall,
                        etc. | Five minutes after the arrival of this party trom Khartoum, Mrs.
                        Asser severed the ribbon connecting the orthodox bottle of wine, and gave
                        the vessel the name "LORD CROMER", which immediately took the water in
                        record style. Great credit is due to Mr. Sharp, the com pany's foreman of
                        works, and his staft for the admirable arrangement made for the launch,
                        which was an unqualified success. This stern wheel steamer, from its
                        graceful appearance, promises to eclipse any boat at present afloat south of
                        Khartoum A speed of ten miles per hour is guaranteed by the buil ders, and
                        they have every hope of exceeding this when the steam trials take place next
                        month During the ceremony, the following telegram was received from Captain
                        A. McMurdo :--- "'Thank Mrs. Asser for the houour she has done the
                        department of christening the steamer which will help to perpetuate the
                        memory of the great statesman after which the boat is named." In a few well
                        chosen words from Mr. Wil kinson, who represented the Departinent, the
                        success of the boat was proposed and the toast duly honoured Mr. Haruld F
                        Hall, Manager of the Sudan Development and Exploration Company Limited,
                        proposed a vote of thanks to Mrs. Asser and those present, which brought the
                        proceedings to an end.</p>

                    <p>The Cairo Correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," in discussing the number of
                        cases Judge Cator had to judge, remarks that the recent sessions of the
                        Supreme Consular Court "have once more brought to the foreground a very real
                        necessity, namely, the residence in Egypt of a British judge, or the
                        increasing of the powers of the mixed tribunal. For as the British community
                        increases in size and in wealth, 90 do its legal necessities grow, and it is
                        becoining more and more impossible to meet these necessities by ineans of a
                        judge, however able he may be, whose place of resideboe in Constantinople,
                        added to the fact that he is of necessity out of touch both the feelings and
                        the needs of a community with which he so seldom comes in contact.</p>

                    <p>TERRIBLE KIDNEY DISEASE FOLLOWS A CHILL</p>
                    <p>Mr. John McCrorie, 11, Preston Street, Govanhill, Glasgow, Scotland, gave an
                        account of his illness to one of our representatives. He said My illness,
                        which I trace to getting wet and cold, Coinmenced about November, 1901, with
                        sharp, shooting pains in the small of iny back, het weep my shoulders, in my
                        head. right side, and occasionally about my heart. 1 was also troubled with
                        heallache, drowsiness, dimoess of sight, geeing spots before my eyes,
                        sleeplessness, poor appetite, and general weak nese, which gradually grew
                        worse and worse, About three weeks ofter my illness commenced iny face,
                        hands, limbs and body began to swell, and at the same time I was attacked by
                        urinary disorders which caused 19 ere pain. When I called the doctor in he
                        informed me that I was suffering from a inost severe torin of kidney
                        disease, after he bad trested me a short time he told me that he could do
                        little for me and that I must go to the hospital. I went, and lay there for
                        14 weeks, but the treatment did me little good Eventually I was advised to
                        leave the hospital as no more could be done for me. "I heard of Doan's
                        Backache Kidney Pille and decided to give them a trial After taking them
                        about three weeks I felt that tbey were doing me good, and from tben onward
                        I grew better and stronger every day, so that I knew at last I had obtained
                        a medicine which was aoting directly on my trouble. I kept on with the pills
                        until I felt that I was the same man in health and strength that I had been
                        betore my illness. Then, 4 years after his cure Mr. McCrorie said: "Since my
                        cure I bave never had the least returi of my old trouble.' Doan's Kidney
                        Pills are for sale by all chemists and dr ggists at 13 PT per box, or 71

                    <p>ITS INFLUENCE IN STAMBOUL.</p>
                    <p>The financial crisis prevailing in Egypt appears to have had an effect in
                        Constantinople, which has a crisis of its own. Renter's correspondent writes
                        : The causes of the crisis are many and various, one factor being the
                        tendency of bauks to give large eredit. The first setback which the local
                        market experienced was the result of the orisis in Egypt. The Egyptian
                        krach" greatly undermined the predit of Near Eastern business paper
                        generally and especially in London. The local banks thereupon, began to
                        insist on more cover, and, scared by the failure of one or two big Armenian
                        firms, refused to show any indulgence, thus greatly accentuai ing the
                        difficulties of their clients, npon whom they had previously pressed almost
                        unlimited credit.</p>

                    <p>The Fancy Sale at this lostitute passed off very successfully. Apart from the
                        two large | fancy stalls where many pretty and useful 1 articles were
                        displayed, there was the great attraction of the Christmas tree for which
                        many of the little folk impatiently waited. Mrs. Morrison, who had spent
                        much time on the previous day in decorating the tree was unable to be
                        present, but the Misses Davis sussisted by three or four gentlemen, most
                        ably and quickly distributed the prizes to the satisfaction of all the
                        little holders of tickets. Shortly before 4 o'clock the refreshment tables,
                        over which Mrs. Algernon Ward presided, were all occupied, and by 5.30
                        o'clock 156 persons had partaken of an excellent tea. The ladies, who
                        assisted Mrs. Algernon Ward, were the the Hon. Mrs Hopkinson, Mrs. Neville
                        Borton, Mrs. Hicks Paull, Miss Garnett Botfield, and Miss Phyllis Mo88. Mrs.
                        P. H. Kingham who presided at one of the fancy stalls was most successful
                        and although most of the articles on this stall were trifles, at low prices,
                        over £18, (including sale of tickets by Miss Gwendolen Kingham) were
                        realized. Mrs. Benwell Rees and Mrs. Stanley Gordon, assisted by Miss Lang
                        Anderson, Miss Gertrude Carver, ani Master Basil Rees, as usual, did a brisk
                        trade, more than £22 being gained at this stall A pleasant afternoon was
                        rendered still more enjoyable by the excellent music played by the string
                        band of the 2nd Bat. Royal Inniskitling Fasiliers, kindly lent by the

                    <p>The fact of Lord Coomer being elected a Fellow of the Zoological Society is
                        interesting because the rulers of this country with which he has so long
                        been associated have contri buted many magnificent specimens of the fauna of
                        that historie territory. The first giraffe ever brou ght alive to this
                        country was that presented I to King George IV, by the Pasha of Egypt -
                        Mohamed Al-while soon atter the foundation ot the society his Highness
                        Ibrahim Pasha -Viceroy of Egypt - made an important contribution, consisting
                        of a giraffe, two drome daries, four antelopes, two ostriches, and two
                        gazelles. This was in 1849, and five years later the Pasha presentad &amp;
                        notable hippopotamus, the mother of the animal known familiarly as 'Guy
                        Fawkes," which has been a resident in the gardens ever since the year
                        1872.</p>

                    <head>THE MAMELUKE MASSACRE</head>
                    <p>If writer in the "Spectator" declares that up Ito two years ago an old sheikh
                        was living in Cuiry, who had witnessed the great massacre of the Mamelukes
                        at the Citadel He writes :e Unul two years ago there was living an old
                        1Sheikh who ou state occasions sat at the chief estnance to the citadel, in
                        a chair especially made for him, over which are written the words, in Arabic
                        and English: "Only be, who by the favour of God, bas reached the age of a
                        hundred years may sit in this chair." At his death in 1905 he was said to
                        have been a hundred and fourteen, and on the only occasion, just four years
                        ago, when I had the pleasure of speaking with him, he gave me a graphic
                        description of the massacre of the Mamelukes, saying how "the blood poured
                        down the steep pathway to the gate like a river of water." Even it he was
                        ten years younger at his death than theage ascribed to him and in Egypt what
                        native knows his age!), he might very easily have been old enough to
                        remember the details. His father was, according to his story, "Bowab" or
                        gate keeper of the citadel, and he himself was play. ing near the gate just
                        as the Pasha was wreaking his vengeance on the unfortunate Mamelukes It is
                        of course possible that frequent repetition had embroidered the original
                        tale but in any case it is interesting to think that until such a short time
                        ago there was one still living who was actually spectator of this scene.</p>

                    <p>THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION.</p>
                    <p>Some of our readers have requested us to publish a summary of the arguments
                        of Mr. Robert Devonshire, who represented the Bourse and Banking Company of
                        Egypt before the Supreme Consular Court, where he contest ed the
                        jurisdiction of the H. M's Consular Courts re an application by a
                        shareholder for removal of the Liquidator appointed by the shareholders and
                        for the appointment of another liquidator in his place. The following is a
                        resumé ot Mr. Devonshire's arguments:On behalf of the liquidator it was
                        argue on appeal to the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court that the Court
                        has jurisdiction to en tertain this application. The bends of the argument
                        are as follows: 1. L'nder the Companies' Act 1861 Section 141 "the Court"
                        may on due cause shown remove any liquidator and appoint another •
                        liquidator to act in the matter of a voluntary winding up. The Companies'
                        Winding l'p Act 1890 Sec tion 32 defines the Court" As meaning the Court
                        having Jurisdiction under that Act to wind up the Company 2. The only Courts
                        having jurisdiction in England to wind up a Company are the High Court, the
                        Chancery Courts of the County Palantine of Lancaster and Durham and the
                        County Courts 3. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Consular Court is governed
                        by the Order in Council 1899. Article 107 of this Order in Council Exvides
                        that.</p>
                    <p>"the Supreme Court shall as far as cir"cumstances admit for and within the
                        "Ottoman dominions with respect to "British subjects all such jurisdiction
                        "'except the jurisdiction relative to diso "lution or pulity or jacuitation
                        of marriage "as for the time being belongs to the High "Court in England." </p>
                    <p>The Circumstances do not adunit of the Bupreme Court having jurisdiction of
                        the High Court with reference to the winding up of Coinpanies. The
                        complicated procedure under the Companies Acts involving certain special
                        powers given to the Board of Trade make it imposible in practice for the
                        Consular Court to exercise the powers of the High Court. Article 167 of the
                        Order in Council is as follows</p>
                    <p>"Where, by virtue of this order or "otherwise, any Imperial Act, or any Law
                        "in force in a British Possession, Colony, "or Settlement is applicable in

                        deemed applicable "so far only as the constitution and juris "diction of the
                        Courts acting under this "Order and the local circunstances per "mit, and,
                        for the purpose of facilitating "the application of any such Act or Law, it
                        may be constructed with such alter "ation and adaptions not affectmg the
                        "ubstance as may be necessary, and any "thing by such Act or Law required to
                        be "done by or to any Court, Judge, officer or "authority may be done by or
                        to a Court. "Judge, officer, or authority having the "like or analogous
                        functions, or by or to "any officer designated by the Court for "that
                        purpose, and the seal of the Court "Inay be snostituted for any seal
                        required by any such Actor Law; and in base "any difficulty occurs in the
                        application of "any such ct or Law, it shall be lawful "for the Secretary of
                        State to direct by and to whom, and in what manner, any "thing to be done,
                        and much Act or Law "shall, in its application to matters aris ing within
                        the limits of this Orier, be *onstructed accordingly."</p>
                    <p>The Companies' Acts, so far as winding up is concerned, are not applicable in
                        any place within the linits of the Order If and so far as they are
                        applicable in theory the constitution and jurisdiction of the Con sular
                        Court do not perinit of their application 5. Article 12 of the Owler in

                        Creditors, To sun np the arguments the Consular Court is incompetent by
                        reason of the conflicting jurisdiction of the High Court in England and also
                        by reason of the conflicting jorisdiction in Egypt Mr. Gooiling in replying
                        for the respondent in this appeal made remarks to the following effect He
                        felt sure that all who hart heard Mr. Devonshire were under an obli gation
                        to him for his very interesting address to the Court on behalf of the
                        appellant. The point, however, which had been raised by his learned friend
                        dit not materially affect the case. On the one hand was a Company register
                        ed under the Companies Acts 1862 1900 with an office registered in London to
                        bring the Company within the jurisdiction f London and therefore a corporate
                        body, an English body and on the other, was an Englishman who had brought
                        this action on broad general principles, and in the interests of the public.
                        | The powers of the London Courts had been conferred on the consular Courts
                        of Egypt by the Orders in Cotineil known as "The Principal Order 1899" --
                        and he relied on that Order which had long guided the Consular Courts in
                        dealing with these matters He said that the I point raised by Mr. Devonshire
                        had been dealt with by the leamed judge whom he asked to do nothing at this
                        junetore when the confidence of the publie was much shaken in directors of
                        public companies, to interfere with or limit in any way the jurisdiction
                        hitherto exercised by the Consular Courts of Egypt and to dismiss the appeal
                        of the appellant company It was ordered That the appeal be dismissed with

                            those objections and difficulties may no tonger exist, but be sure that
                            either some old or new ones still be snay the Government path to a
                            solution ; yet it is still open to Interested" or anyone else to make a
                            further essay. Muebas I should like to, I feel I ought not to trespass
                            on your space in detailing the various attempts made to obtain from home
                            the financial sup port with which to establish a civil service
                            cooperative society with which was to have been incorporated a building
                            society based on the lines of the Birkbeek, Starr Bowkett and kindred
                            institutions, but it "Luterested" chooses to make my personal
                            acquaintance (I sball res. pect his desire to remain anonymous) I would
                            give him an interesting resumé of these. I regret that I did not make it
                            clearer that those I had in mind were the better class, well educated
                            but poorly paid civil servants (and not the highly paid otheials) who
                            have long yearned for a home which they might call their own, and from
                            which they could not be turned out or bad their rents doubled at the
                            whim of a capricious landlord. My suggestion is to commence by aiding
                            those employés who some years since bought building sites of about 1,000
                            metres square each, at prices from LE. 10 to L E. 50 per plot. Compare
                            these prices with those of the cheapest lands now obtainable On these
                            1,000 metre sites a good bun galow pattern house (six or 8 roomed with
                            usual offioes) may be soustructed, Jearing say 600 square metres for
                            kitchen and ornamental garden, poultry run, fruit trees etc. The size
                            and therefore cost of each house would be governed by the requirements
                            and means of families or individuals, but accept As a general average
                            LE. 400 as the cost of the largest houses, the probable bighest monthly
                            charge would be L E 4, viz : 7% interest and 5 amortization per annum.
                            As a set off to this charge there would be taken into con sideration the
                            economy resulting from the growing of ones own vegetables and otber
                            green food, plus a considerable saving in the lighting charge, and other
                            small items which will at once occur to those who have been compelled to
                            "keep house" in the city itself. Of course the proposed bailding group
                            or syndicate wonld not be expected to confine their energies to the
                            amelioration of the lot of government officials only, but I have made a
                            particular point of their case as the bousing problem, as I have
                            indicated, has been a much debated question amongst them for years,
                            while in the respective government depart ments and administrations the
                            bon-technical employé can appeal to his professional and technical
                            colleagues to belp him over his difficulties ; for example though I do
                            not suggest that he should expect all services to be given gratuitously,
                            be might have at his disposition the advice of civil, mechanical and
                            sanitary engineers, architects and draughtsmen, agricultural and
                            gardening experts and so on, at nominal fees. It has been suggested to
                            me that there are quite enough companiesas it is, and the creation of
                            another one is not desirable; true, but I do not suggest the creation of
                            another company similar to some already existing ; far from it. The
                            company I suggest is one that is actually wanted, is being asked for,
                            and whieh ust come, for of six companies (two Rgyptian and four English
                            with a combined capital of L.E. 1,500,000) one of whose objects as per
                            their respective prospectuses is the construction of economical
                            residences on the deferred payment or annuity system, not one is
                            prepared to carry out this part of their programme except may be on
                            lands belonging to themselves. Such being the case, no one of them may
                            cavil at the formation of a group or company to aid small proprietors to
                            build their own houses on their own lands, tor not one of them may be
                            con-idered as an even very remotely possible client of any one of the
                            existing companies. It is agreed op all sides that this housing problem
                            is one calling for immediato attention, and as pointed out, none of the
                            present ompanies are inclined, or in a position, to tackle the matter in
                            the way it should be tackled, and although ove may be sorry for some of
                            the shareholders, it is unreasonable to expect that they should
                            monopolize whatever consideration and sympathy may be left when all of
                            such consideration and sympathy should be extended to those who, ekeing
                            out a precarious liveli. hood, are suffering, and so aoutely, as a
                            consequence of the wild speculation and gambling in building land and
                            house properties for which some company prospect uses are directly
                            responsible Now Mr. Interested, I think you will have seen that the
                            scheme I put forward is not so Utopian after all ; will you not "Come
                            overand help us"?</p>

                    <p>The St. Andrew PC. on the 21st instant met a detachment of the Dublins at
                        Mustapha Pasha. The Saints won the toss and elected to kick with the wind,
                        which was blowing strongly. The visitors immediately pressed but in spite of
                        the fact that they had for the first 20 minutes the most of the play they
                        were not sacoesgful in scoring. On several oecasions tbe Dublins broke away
                        but, thanks to the nseful work of Keill and Cassels at back, registered no
                        points during the first half. At half time no goals were | scored. On
                        resuming, the bome team kept the ball almost continuously in the Saints'
                        territory, and ten minute: from time put the ball between the sticks froun a
                        free kick near the mouth of the Saints' stronghold. Five minutes later the
                        Saints were successful in forcing the ball through the Dublins' goal, but
                        unfortunately the whistle had previously blowo for a foul against them.
                        Cassels played a remarkably strong game | for St. Andrews and he and Keill
                        composed a very reliable defence. Result. Dublins 1. St Andrews 0.</p>

                        explanation of its appearance so far from land is that it had been chased by
                        one of the large falcons common on the Red Sea coasts, and in its flights
                        bad flown out to gea, fearing to return until land had long been lost to
                        sight, and the passing steamship became the only refuge for its tired

                    <p>DEAR MR> SPICER.-The work of which you send me photos is certainly of very
                        high quality and I have rarely seen Heads' mounted with such skill and
                        finish. Only an Artist could bestow the amount of care and modelling which
                        appear in the faces of Deer, and in your works you are so highly successful
                        there is little left to be desired.</p>
                    <p>Yours very truly,</p>

                    <p>Mardi 24 Decembre</p>
                    <p>Bien que l'ouverture ait eu lieu dans le même sens qu'hier il s'est produit à
                        la suite de quelques aobats un relèvement partiel qui a rompa la monotonie
                        des séances précédentes. Dans l'ensemble pourtant les offres ont continue
                        poser sur les cours et à déterminer une nouvelle dépression. Parmi les
                        valeurs qui ont joui d'un retour de faveur i faat signaler la National Bank
                        en avance do 19 18/16 a 19 7/8, los Markets de 21/9 22/8, la Salt and Soda
                        de 19/9 a 13/5 les Lots Turcs de 161 &amp; 168, la Banque d'Orient de 111
                        1/4 a l'11/2, et l'Obligation nouvelle Crédit Poucier de 250 à 260 1/2. La
                        Daira passe ici de 12 9,16 à 12 8/4 sans vendeurs, pendant qu'à Londres elle
                        est demandée à 13. A noter snoore une reprise de la Sidi Salem qui,
                        délaissée depuis quelque temps à 1 7/8, a donné liec ce matin a un certain
                        mouvement aux environs de 2 livres. Ce réveil serait dû à la nouvelle que la
                        Société aurait vendu en tout depuis sa constitution 625 feddans de ses ter.
                        raing un prix moyen de 78 L.E. environ. Ona traité aussi l'Unifiée
                        Egyptienne et la Khedivial Mail. La Delta Light a été recher chée. En
                        revanche, ou a beaucaup offert l'Ur. haine et la Delta Land, qui ont fléchi
                        pour ce motif la première de 3 116 à 2 7/8 et la seconde do 1 18111/6. Ea
                        baisse également la Ramleh de 4 5/16 &amp; 4 3/16, la Banque d Athènes de
                        112 1/4 &amp; 112, les Nungovich Hotels de 14 34 à 14 1 2, l'Ordinary
                        Khodivial Mail de 20/3 à 20/-, lo Comptoir de 2 3/16 4 2 1/8, la Building
                        Lands de 1 7/16 à 1 3/8, l'Union Foncière de 4 5/16 à 41/4, la fondateur
                        Allotment de 46 à 42 PT, et la Port Said Salt de 11/10 1/2 à 11 3. Il n'y a
                        pas d'autre changement à signaler. Comme on le voit, l'ensemble continue à
                        être déprimé. Le petite reprise partielle que nous venons de constater n'en
                        est pas moins encou. rageante, si l'on pense que les ciroonstances sont
                        plutôt défavorables. Elle est attribuée à des achats de portefeuilles qui
                        estiment avan. tageux les cours atteints par les valeurs en question. Le
                        fait est que précisément à cause du bas niveau actuel, les détenteurs ne
                        vendent plus qu'à la dernière extrémité. C'est ce qui explique le
                        fléchissement inogi de l'Obligation Crédit Foncier 274 vendeurs. Ce titre
                        étant toujours négociable et répandu parmi la petite épargne, celle-ci le
                        liquide pour se faire du numéraire pour ses écbéances de fin d'année. On
                        critique beancoup la vente aux enchères publiques faite au Caire par une
                        banque de la ville. Paute de publicité donnée à cette vente le paquet a été
                        écoulé à des prix très bas, Le taux privé d'escompte en Angleterre, qui

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
