                        <p>The weather yestereday was decidedly warm but the heat tempered by a dry
                            wind. During the night the wind rose and became somewhat gusty. This
                            morning opens very fine and bracing, with a light W. breeze and a steady
                            barometer.</p>

                    <head>AUSTRIA AND HUNGARY.</head>
                    <p>The political troubles of Austria-Hungary usually begin again as soon as they
                        are settled. Hungary is always striving to realise its historic ideal of an
                        independent autonomous <cb n="6"/> Kingdom. Austria can never forget that it
                        has for centuries had the actual primacy in an Empire which was for many
                        generations the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, then for two
                        generations an Austrian Empire. The Austrian Dachies owed their privileged
                        position to their being the marches of the German nation on the Eastern
                        frontier, while their Dake Was Germany's defender against Tarks and other
                        dangers from the East, a function which he was able to fulfill when he
                        combined with his authority in Austria proper the position of King of
                        Bohemia, of Emperor of Germany, and of King of Hungary. Of this quadruple
                        authority the most dignified portion was that which belonged to the Imperial
                        title, and it had for the Germans of Austria proper the great advantage that
                        it gave them a disproportionate share in the administrative offices of the
                        German Empire, as well as of Bohemia, and for a long period of the
                        Nineteenth Century of Hungary also. Of the new or restored position of
                        Hungary as an autonomous Kingdom, united to Austria by little more than a
                        personal tie, and by a settlement which was more like a treaty than a
                        Constitution, the Germans of Austria have always been jealous. They are in
                        perpetual political feud with the Hungarians and within their own half of
                        the Monarchy, which includes the Tyrol, Styris, and Carinthia, as well as
                        the Kingdom of Bohemia they are always at issue with their fellow subjects
                        of Slavonic race. The latest quarrel tarns on the new tariff agreement
                        between the Western and Eastern halves of the Dual Monarchy. One day it was
                        believed and announced by the Hungarian Ministry that an agreement
                        satisfactory to both halves of the Monarchy had been reached. Next day the
                        Austrian Ministry denied that there was such an agreement and resigned. The
                        Emperor-King has spent a great part of his life in the attempt to find
                        settlements which can be accepted by the different groups of his subjects,
                        who are all loyal, but never agree with one another for long. It seems that
                        his Majesty had on this occasion assented to the Hungarian proposals. But
                        this seems to have been more than his Austrian Ministers were prepared for.
                        The consequence is that a fresh Austrian Ministry will have to be formed and
                        that. there will be a new period of discussion and negotiation. Meanwhile,
                        of course, opinion in Vienna is with the resigning Ministry and the
                        sentiment of Buda-Pest is one of exaltation at what is regarded as the
                        success of the lately appointed national Ministry of Hungary.</p>

                    <head>THE DUTCH MERCANTILE MARINE.</head>
                    <p>In a report to the Foreing Office on the trade and navigation of Rotterdam
                        for the year 1905, Consul Taring states that the fear entertained in 1904
                        that some owner of vessels might be forced to reduce their capital or to
                        liquidate their business as a result of the unsatisfactory state of the
                        freight market was partially verified. During the first seven months of the
                        year rates continued low, but an improvement subsequently set in and several
                        companies running cargo boats reaped the benefit. The larger companies
                        having regular lines of steamers were less affected by the depressed rates,
                        and their financial results for 1905 are satisfactory. The Holland America
                        Line operated very successfully as the result of the large increase in the
                        carriage of emigrants and the improved rates of freight from America, the
                        company's earnings allowing of the payment of a dividend of 15 per cent. A
                        new steamer of 17,250 tons, built at Belfast by Messrs. Harland and Wolff,
                        accommodating 440 first class, 246 second class, and 2 200 steerage
                        passengers, commenced her maiden trip on April 7, 1906. The Rotterdam Lloyd,
                        trading between Rotterdam and Java, increased their fleet by four steamers
                        and declared a dividend of 9 per cent. The Steamship Company Nederland,
                        likewise trading to the Dutch East Indies, built three steamers of much
                        larger tonnage than those hitherto running. The South Ameries Line of
                        steamers chartered two vessels with a view to opposing the competition of
                        German companies, and as a result the cutting of rates has ended and the
                        company has joined the pool of the lines running to South America</p>

                        accompanied by &amp; number of the Ulema and notables of Alexandria, who had

                        were inspected by the Khedive, who remained about half an hour in the
                        mosque. Several odes were submitted to his Highness, who expressed himself
                        in terms that were most complimentary to the diligence of the mosque
                        students and the ability of their teacher. The ceremony over, H.H. the

                        into a subdivision of the province of Dakablieb, while it retains the title
                        of gouvernorat and continues to dispense with the post of omdeh which forms
                        part of the administration of ordinary markazos. The Markaz of Paraskoor is
                        absorbed in the new organization, of which it will form part as an outpost
                        of police. A redistribution of jurisdiction between Damietta and Faraskoar
                        in connection with the surrounding villages has also been carried out.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of the Interior bases its decision on an equitable consideration

                        detriment of Damietta since this place will retain all its main features as

                    <p>Trovators was given by the Castellano company at the Abbas Theatre, Cairo,
                        with all the melodramatic effect it exacts : truly a most thunderous,
                        flaming sonority-mediæval Surrey-side. For actual singing we had the debut
                        of Siga. Riga 48 Eleonora, looking very handsome, genre Walter Soott, raven
                        locks, and pale face, and singing very well, in a fine, tall rounded voice.
                        Siga. Esposito was Ezucena, a mezzo soprano with an excellent range of lower
                        notes. She was really the best of the whole caste. Signor Grandi was rather
                        too overpowering at first, and lacked delicacy. His voice and action were
                        too pronounced, too staccato, but his prison song earned him a well deserved
                        temporary release from the dungeon, and he was admirable in the finale.
                        Signor Arrighetti was, as usual, too much inclined to draw out his high
                        notes (one was tempted to time the longer notes with &amp; stopwatch !), but
                        he has a good, sonorous voice In all, it was a good performance of a most
                        enlivening and "awakening" opera.</p>
                    <p>The performance of Rigoletto, except for the 2nd act, and rather better
                        acting than before by Rigoletto himself (Signor Arrighetti), was not as good
                        as on the first occasion, a few days ago. Siguor Battani seemed to be
                        affected by the comparative smallness of the audience and did not trouble to
                        introduce the exquisite delicacy he had shown before. He was rather on the
                        "loud" side, and as he has a voice which could fill a full-sized
                        opera-house, the effect was not perfect. But, as we said, in the 2nd act his
                        duet with Gilds was quite perfect as was her "Caro nome" song. The "Donna è
                        mobile" was good enough for anyone else, but only medium for Signor Battani,
                        because of that same apparent carelessness, but the little snatches of it
                        that keep coming into the rest of the 4th act were most delightful. We must
                        mention the base - Sparafucile-who has some exceptionally good low notes,
                        one, indeed, in the 2nd act (in his interview with Rigoletto), sustained,
                        long, and absolutely faultless.</p>

                    <p>We have received a copy of an open letter to the Ottoman High Commissioner,
                        written from Constantinople in Turkish, and dated May 16, 1906. Translated
                        it runs as follows:</p>
                    <p>Excellency, -The crown of prosperity cannot be easily won in this world.
                        Charce, working strangely, never permits the traveller on the road of good
                        fortune to stop half way. He either attains prosperity without a halt on his
                        climb, or falls heavily and headlong. To-day, behold your Excellency exposed
                        and indeed condemned to this overthrow. Being myself a man of religious
                        feeling, and considering your old age to be honourable, I would have wished
                        you, after your defeat in the matter of Akaba, had kept silence and so won
                        the respect of the world. But alas ! you are still supporting your own
                        error, so hear what I have to say.</p>
                    <p>It is a principle of statesmanship that if a grievous political error be
                        committed. Even by a Government, those responsible for that error must
                        resign, and bear on their own shoulders the shame of their Government and
                        their nation. In the Akaba question you were the author of the differences
                        that arose between the Governments. You sought, after a long inactivity in
                        Egypt, and an earlier renown in war, to crown your military glory by
                        diplomatic success. It was you who advised your Government to concern itself
                        with this question and your advice being mistaken, you did not prosper. You
                        wished to go forward from Tabah to Tor, but you have been driven back into
                        the sea of contempt whose waves have engulfed you.</p>
                    <p>We hoped that you would prove a good guide for as in Egyptian matters, and we
                        believed that a Vizier like yourself, who had passed many years in the
                        Valley of the Nile in the great position of High Commissioner of the Empire,
                        would surely be conversant with international questions. However, long
                        delays passed in the discussion of the question and we began to tremble and
                        to doubt your powers, nor did we desire to see you follow a dangerous road.
                        But perhaps you were intoxicated by your high position. You said, "Have no
                        fears ; follow me; my followers will climb Mount Sinai as Moses climbed."
                        Unhappily we trusted and followed you—but instead of leading us to that
                        lofty eminence you led as and your Government over a precipice.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian question once entrusted to you, the fall of our Government
                        began. Your weakness was made manifest to the world. Yoar ill.guidance was
                        our rain. To-day the honour of our Empire is under toot Through you we are a
                        laughing stock. Moreover, the future of our country has been compromised
                        (lit. fell down) with the honour of our Government. Your ill-guidance has
                        lost us Egypt and will lose us part of Syria. Remember Lord Fitzmaurice's
                        words to the House of Lords.</p>
                    <p>"I need not remind the House that the principal cause of our occupation of
                        Egypt in 1882 was the fact that the agitation in that country threatened the
                        Suez Canal. I need not say that after an occupation designed to protect the
                        Canal against danger from the West, we cannot show ourselves indifferent, 24
                        years later, to similar dangers threatening it from the East."</p>
                    <p>Justice demands of you a material, not merely a moral penalty. In these days
                        a Government does not dismiss an old and tried official - but the nation
                        expects you to resign.</p>
                    <p>Your fall from so exalted a position is a painful spectacle. But when blind
                        fortune is accompanied by ignorance, a fall is meritable. To save his
                        honour, Mukhtar Pacha must resign his office. Cease to mislead your
                        Government and your nation for merely personal ende. Our Government's
                        representative at the Ismailieh Palace must be enlightened by the virtues of
                        our Faith and of our national character. After 24 years Mokhtar Pacha has
                        proved unequal to his duties through advancing age, and our people have no
                        wish to see him continue to represent them in Egypt after his defeat in the
                        Akaba question, and the blackening of his reputation. Save yourself from
                        further shame.</p>

                    <head>MIKADO AND ISLAM. <lb/>EGYPTIAN MISSION TO JAPAN.</head>
                    <p>A subscription has been started in Cairo for the purpose of sending a Moslem
                        Mission to Japan to convert the Japanese to Islam. The news of the alleged
                        conversion of the Mikado has given rise to some strange reflections in the
                        native Press. We give some of them :</p>
                    <p>"Al Umma'': The Mohamedan religion being, in fact, a spirit for the soul and
                        a light for the heart, H.M. the Mikado of Japan inclined to profess
                        Islam-the religion of prosperity and nature which originated among Bedouins,
                        spread without preachers, and took a wonderful and firm hold on the
                        civilised world. The news of the conversion of that great Emperor has
                        created a great amount of interest. The ulema have been called to cross the
                        Ocean and preach Islam to the Japanese, and it has been suggested that the
                        Wakfs Administration should pay the expenses of the Mohamedan Mission, while
                        others say that the Wakfs' money cannot be disposed of for the scheme. But
                        we are of opinion that the spread of Islam and the Jehad in the way of God
                        are the most sacred duties for which the Wakfs Administration must spend
                        money generously. To spend money for the spread of Islam is, in our opinion,
                        more laudable, and more meritorious before God and his prophet, than to
                        cover the Kaaba with precious coverings. H.H. our Emir (the Khedive) also
                        sees that preaching is more sacred than any other necessary and sacred
                        objects. His Highness's religious duties make him support the scheme of
                        sending a Moslem Mission to preach Islam in Japan at the expense of the
                        Wakfs Administration.</p>
                    <p>"Al-Zaher": We are afraid that while we are shouting and babbling here the
                        conference of religions in Japan will have been held and dissolved and the
                        Mikado will have chosen a suitable faith for his people. We are of opinion
                        that if anything is to be done it must be done promptly; and we suggest that
                        the mission be composed of the following gentlemen: Sand Bey Zaghloul
                        (chairman), Ahmed Fethi Bey Zaghloul, Ibrahim Bey Hilbawi, Mahmoud Bay
                        Salem, Sheikh Ahmed Abou Khatwa, Sheikh Mohamed Bakhit, and Sheikh Mohamed
                        Radi, members.</p>
                    <p>"Al Lewa" says that the project of despatching a Mohamedan Mission to Japan
                        is not an easy one, which can be achieved with such small subscriptions as
                        have been received. Oar contemporary expects to get generous donations from
                        Mohamed Shawarbi Pachs, Ali Fehmy Pacha, and other wealthy people.</p>
                    <p>Numerous lettera have been received by our contemporary declaring that the
                        conversion of the Japanese is a matter of the first importance to the Moslem
                        world but containing no very definite suggestions as to how such a task is
                        to be carried out. "Al Lewa" was recently mach exercised over the attempts
                        to proselytise which it imputed to British and American missionaries. But of
                        course that is quite a different thing!</p>

                    <p>Lord Cromer has sent the following reply to Mr.Canessa, which we are glad to
                        reproduce:</p>
                    <p>Sir, I have received your letter of this day's date in which you ask for my
                        support in obtaining the unanimous consent of the shop proprietors of Cairo

                        gentlemen to whom you allude; but I venture to express a hope that they will
                        before long acquiesce in the adoption of a measure which has been so largely
                        and successfully put in force in other countries, and in favour of which so
                        many powerful arguments, founded on considerations of humanity and of the

                        85 at 8 a.m., and 40 at noon. The amount of the collections at matins and

                        help to the Delta Chaplaincy from St. Mark's. These services were also well
                        attended, and heartily rendered. At both the anthem "God is a Spirit," from

                        effectively as an unaccompanied quartette. The decoration of the font was

                        leotern was due to Mrs. Byre ; that of the choir-stalls to. Mrs. Roberts and
                        Miss Roberts ; and the altar vases to Mrs. Firminger and Mrs. Ward. The

                    <head>THE BRITISH SCHOOL AT SPARTA.</head>
                    <p>The work of the British School is now in fall. swing at Sparta, and for the
                        moment the whole staff has been transferred from its usual headquarters at
                        Athens to the banks of the Earotas. Mr. Bosanqaet, the Director of the
                        School; Mr. Dawking, who will shortly succeed him in that post ; Mr. Wace,
                        who has rendered such good service to archaeologists by his catalogue of the
                        Sparta Museum; Mr. Dickens, and Mr. Tillyard are all engaged on the work
                        which the school has undertaken there; while Mr. Traquair, the architect, is
                        at present making a tour of the Frankish Castles of Lakonis, and has just
                        visited Passava, the splendidly-situated castle of Jean de Neuilly,
                        hereditary Marshal of Achaia, whence his war cry of passe avant used once to
                        awaken the echoes of the rocks when, far in the valley below, armed men
                        passed through the narrow defile into Maina. Mr. Traquair has made plans and
                        sketches of this fine Prankish fortress, as well as of Gay de Nivelet's
                        baronial castle of Geraki, with its interesting Byzantine churches, and of
                        Monemvasia, the Gibraltar of mediæval Greece, "the sacred rock,” which was
                        the last refuge of Hellenism against the Franks, and which, after its
                        retrocession by the latter in 1262, furnished the ablest seaman to the
                        Byzantine Navy for close on 200 years. It is enormously to the credit of
                        British scholarship that a fellow-countryman of George Finlay should be the
                        first to make a systematic plan of those fortresses, whose fortunes the
                        great historian of mediaeval Greece has described in his famous work.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile at Sparta itself 70 men, 65 Lakonians and five Cretans (the latter
                        all picked men specially skilled in excavation work), are engaged on the
                        exploration of the ancient city near the Eurotas. The idea of these
                        excavations arose in 1904, when it was reported that some Spartan schoolboys
                        had found clay figurines at the spot. The actual work of digging began in
                        April of the present year, and in the short time which has elapsed since
                        then great progress has been made. The diggers have laid bare three
                        different strata, two Greek and one Roman, and the "excavation house,” in
                        which the school has taken up its abode, as well as a cottage opposite, are
                        already full of the objects discovered. Nearly 10,000 lead figurines, votive
                        offerings of the pious, and numbers of votive pots and little statuettes
                        have been found, some of them of considerable artistic value, and all
                        emanating from the Artemision. From the discovery of several strigils
                        bearing the name of Artemis Orthia, to whom they were dedicated, it is
                        certain that the foundations which the school has unearthed belonged to the
                        temple of that goddess. Another building, Greek or GræcoRoman in date, has
                        also come to light, and the foundations of an unknown edifice have just been
                        laid bare, possibly the stylobate of another temple. But Spaits wag &amp;
                        Byzantine city op till the time when Mistrå was built by William de
                        Villebardouin, Prince of Achaia, about 1248, just as it had formerly been a
                        Greek and a Roman town, and from the Byzantine settlement curious pieces of
                        pottery, coins, and other things have already been collected We know that
                        Byzantine Sparta was a place alike of some military and commercial
                        importance, for the "Chronicle of the Morea" mentions its high walls at the
                        time of the Frankish Conquest, and the author of the life of Bt. Nikon, its
                        patron-saint, alludes to the large colony of Jews which existed there in the
                        latter half of the Ninth Century, when that holy man tried to expel them
                        with all the zeal of a mediæval fanatic. It is not surprising, therefore,
                        that it should field considerable stores, as well as the Greek and Roman
                        towns which it Bacoeeded.</p>
                    <p>At present fervet opus, and such will be the case till about the end of June,
                        when the work will be temporarily suspended till next season. Modern Sparta
                        has every reason — no less than archæology-to bless the school's work, for
                        it provides occupation to a number of labourers, and is a ceaseless source
                        of conversation to the extremely numerous bodies of lawyers and doctors who
                        live in the small + which Otho and Amalia created some years ago to bear the
                        great name of S rta. Modern Sparta, it must be confessed, is only magnis
                        nominis umbra. One does not detect Spartan physique among the modern

                    <head>CRESCENT AND CROSS.<lb/>WESTERN INFLUENCE IN THE EAST.</head>
                    <p>The name of Professor Arminius Vambéry is familiar to those whose studies
                        have led them into the romantic East, and his work, "Travels in Central
                        Asia," is remembered as a masterly treatise on life in that vast and
                        historic continent.</p>
                    <p>In his latest work, Western Culture in Eastern Landis," which has just been
                        published by Mr. John Morray, Professor Vambéry compares the methods adopted
                        by England and Raggia in the Middle East. One object of the work is to
                        defend himself against the accusation often laid against him in his
                        criticism and appreciation of the civilising work of the two countries that
                        he showed partiality to England, and did not fairly represent the Russian
                        position.</p>
                    <p>We fear that those critics who have-somewhat unjustly, we think-made this
                        accusation will not be satisfied with the arrangement of this "vindication"
                        of the Professor's attitude, and we expect to be reminded of the odiousness
                        of comparisons. That such an analogy as is here made is not quite to the
                        aesthetic taste, we admit, but it serves a useful purpose in helping us to a
                        clearer judgement of the claim often made that Rassia, by reason of her
                        situation and nationality, is best fitted to carry on the work of
                        civilisation in Asia. Professor Vambéry is undoubtedly favourably disposed
                        towards Britain, but we cannot but feel that in those pages he has made out
                        a good case for the subject of his choice. He lays a strong indictment
                        against the methods of Russia in Central Asia. He is nothing if not a
                        generous critic, and he points out that even the best intentions of the
                        Russian Government most often fail through the unreliability, corruption,
                        and arrogance of its servants. These unfortunate traits in the character of
                        those to whom the work of penetration was delegated seem to have been
                        largely responsible for some of the unhappy results of the Russian policy.
                        We have heard bitter complaints of the cruel domination of the peasant by
                        the Russian bureaucracy, and the same unhappy combination of oppression and
                        coercion appears to have been resorted to, in the Middle East, to an
                        inordinate degre. As the author pats it: "In the hierarchy of the Tsar,
                        among the representatives of the starving millions of Asis, decked out in
                        the garments of European culture, there are but few who are actuated by a
                        real desire to promote the good of the natives, or who possess a spark of
                        love or enthusiasm for the work of reformation they are undertaking. Many of
                        them have no conception of the task that awaits them. Distinction and
                        promotion, cards and drinking boats, are the high ideals which rise up
                        before their mind's eye, and Bathral them." We have not forgotten the
                        accounts sent through from the front during the Russo-Japanese war of the
                        debauchery of the Tsar's officers in times of oritical moment. In both cases
                        Russia appears to have suffered from the mistakes and irresponsibility of
                        her servants. Conversion by coercion is never a satisfactory operation, but
                        when the "civilising" efforts are accompanied with cruelty and immoral
                        habits in the "civilisere,” wa can well imagine what the effect upon the
                        minds of the Mohamelan is likely to be.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding his unsparing condemnation of Russian methods, Professor
                        Vambéry again shows his sense of fairness in his summing up of the results
                        of Russian influence. He says : "Judging dispassionately, and without
                        prejudice, as is seemly to do in matters of sach moment, we must frankly
                        acknowledge that the Rassians have done good work in Asia, that with their
                        advent order, peace, and security have taken the place of aparoby and
                        lawless noas, and that, notwithstanding the strongly Oriental colouring of
                        their political, social and ecclesiastical institutions as representatives
                        of the Western world, they have everywhere made 1 change for the better, and
                        inaugurated an era more worthy of homspity."</p>
                    <p>Reviewing the work of the British in India, the author sets out in contrast
                        our methode in that country against those of Russia in Turkestan and other
                        parts of the Middle East. The foundation of the British Empire in India he
                        <cb/> clearly demonstrates to be the result of the <!-- illegible -->,
                        combined with the justice and forbearance, of British role. The Hindus had
                        for generations been oppressed and exploited by the despotic native rulers,
                        and kindly and just treatment was new to them. Hence "their affections
                        naturally went out to the masters whose role brought peace, and blessing,
                        and order." As Professor Vambéry remarks: "A good name the English will
                        certainly leave in history. Their labours in India will form the worthy
                        apotheosis of our Western culture, and when to-day we rightly admire Rome's
                        cultural influence upon the Old World, what England has accomplished in
                        lndia will in after-ages receive the greater recognition, as the work in its
                        future development promises to be still more imposing, mightier, and more
                        far-reaching in its results. Even now her influence reaches from India
                        across the whole of South and East Asia, and in this portion of the ancient
                        world English is considered the language of civilisation par
                        excellence."</p>
                    <p>What Professor Vambéry says with so much pride of the British influence in
                        India can be said with truth of that same influence now operating in Egypt.
                        The results are the best test of any policy, and we are content to be judged
                        by that standard in regard to both countries. Formerly misery and oppression
                        were rampant, but now order has taken the place of chaos, ani, as the good
                        work continges, those who tɔ-day are apt to assume the role of carping
                        critics will be silenced.</p>
                    <p>The third part of this admirable and fascinating work is devoted to "The
                        Futore of Islam." On this subject also Professor Vambéry speaks with the
                        assurance of one who has gained his knowledge by direct personal contact
                        with Islam, and his conclusions, therefore, are valuable. He sees to day
                        increasing signs of the awakening of that interesting race. The struggle
                        with prejudice has been keen and long, but the mighty influence of the West
                        is beginning to make itself felt in a very marked degree. The fierce
                        antagonism with which new ideas were hitherto received is disappearing, and
                        the present generation of Mohamedans throughout the East show an increasing
                        desire to share in the advantages of Western culture and civilization.
                        "After thoroughly inquiring into the position of the Islamic world during
                        the first half of the nineteenth century, and comparing this with the
                        present condition of things, in the various departments of human thought and
                        activity in Moslem lands, we come to the conclusion that a decided
                        intellectual evolution has taken place ; that the foundations of the ancient
                        structure have been shaken, that the building itself shows deep rents and
                        tears, and that great changes in this wide sphere of action are imminent.
                        The generally prevailing idea that this crisis only manifests itself in the
                        upper circles of society cannot be maintained. The movement has been noticed
                        everywhere."</p>
                    <p>With regard to the political future of Islam, the opinion is freely expressed
                        by the Professor that "it is absolutely and unalterably true that the reform
                        movement, as it has been carried on thus far, will not lead to a radical
                        political regeneration of the people who profess the Islamic faith, and that
                        a transformation for the better will only be possible when the leadership is
                        taken out of the hands of the present weak and lazy rulers, and given to
                        strong and capable men. Judging from past experiences, the course thus far
                        pursued by the Turkish, Persian, Afghan, Moroccan, and other independent
                        Moslem Governments must end in the total collapse of the reform agitation,
                        because the rulers of these countries fear that the least yielding towards a
                        more modern view of life will weaken and imperil their absolute autocratic
                        power. Consequently they are hostile to all serious and radical reforms.
                        This does not exclude the possibility however, although an unlikely one,
                        that at some future time some Moslem Prince, in imitation of the Emperor of
                        Japan, my become reconciled to reasonable reforms, may conform to the spirit
                        of the age, and say to himself: 'Better go of my own accord than be
                        driven."</p>
                    <p>We commend this work to the careful attention of our readers. It is well
                        worthy of their careful study.</p>

                    <head>RESEARCHES IN SINAI.</head>
                    <p>Egyptology is decidedly one of the most fruitful departments of modern
                        scholarship. and provides some of the most deeply-interesting yields. We
                        have long been accustomed to associate brilliant discovery with the name of
                        Professor Flinders Petrie, and his new book, published to-day, is not less
                        happy in this respect than its many predecessors. Owing to the recent
                        dispute with Turkey about Akabah, newspaper readers have been rendered
                        familiar with some of the leading natural features of that barren stretch of
                        desert and mountain, the Sinaitic Peninsula. Professor Petrie's expedition,
                        starting from Suez, did not cross due East towards Akabah, but turned South
                        for the ancient "three days' journey into, the wilderness" to the first
                        Oasis of Wady Gbaran del, and then went on to the mountains to search for
                        inscriptions out ages ago on the face of the cliffs by the Egyptian
                        turquoise minors at Maghareh. If proof were needed of the ancient
                        overlordship of Egypt over the Bedouins of the peninsula, it is supplied by
                        Professor Petrie. He has found at Maghareh sculptured rocks, bearing the
                        image of King Semerkhet, of the First Dynasty, whose reign dates back to
                        5291 BC. Soven thousand years have passed over the stone, but have hardly
                        left a mark upon it. The original face does not seem to have lost even a
                        single coat of sand grains. One can see the King, armed with a mace,
                        striking the crouching figaro of a Bedouin chief, whose features, says the
                        author, strongly resembles those of the present chief of the district, Abon
                        Gbanéym. The place affords no means of abstinence, and never can have
                        afforded any. All provisions and supplies must be brought up from the Red
                        Sea, three days' distance. Yet it contains a number of elaborate rook
                        inscriptions, very many of which were wantonly ruined three years ago by a
                        turquoise syndicate, holding a concession from the Egyptian Government. One
                        is ashamed to read that the company was an English one. For this is its
                        record :</p>
                    <p>The Khufu sculptures were smashed up. The half dozen Assa inscriptions were
                        all destroyed or buried. The Pepy inscriptions were annihilated. The whole
                        of the Amenemhat inscriptions at the mines have likewise disappeared. The
                        Sneferu scene has been brutally bashed about with a hammer, and the only
                        portrait of Sneferu has been destroyed. The Sahura Boone and the Mon-kan-hor
                        tablet have both been partly blasted away. The Ra-nuser tablet has bad
                        pieces knocked off it. Only the Semerkhet scene, high up above the quarries,
                        the second Sneferu scene, and the tablet of Tahutmess III. have escaped the
                        wanton mischief done by the ignorant savagery of so-called educated
                        men."</p>
                    <p>More disgraceful destruction was never perpetrated, and it is lamentable that
                        no panishmønt is possible. These tablets showed how during scores of
                        centuries the Kings of Egypt used to send turquoise mining expeditions to
                        the interior of the peninsula, which remained there for a few weeks, during
                        the favorable season, and then returned with their spoils, leaving behind
                        them, in their patient, orderly way, a record in imperishable stone of their
                        sovereigns, and a register of their own achievements.</p>
                    <p>These rugged mountains of the Sinai region were valuable only for the
                        turquoises hidden in the veins of their risks, and the presiding deity of
                        the locality was Hathor, the Mistress of Turquoise, who had a shrine and
                        temple at Serabit, in the heart of the stony hills. The earliest cave
                        shrine, says Mr. Petrie, dates back to 4750 BC. ; the temple itself expanded
                        outward, and was continually added to between the years 3450 and 1150 B.C.
                        Hat-hor was not an Egyptian, but a Semitic, goddess—a point of great
                        importance. The Egyptian accepted hor, just as the Romans accepted the local
                        gods of the lands they conquered, and they associated with her in later
                        times the worship of one of their own gods, Sopdu. But the ritual at Serabit
                        was purely Semitic, and its significance is just this, that for a thousand
                        years and more before the time of Moses and the traditional authorisation of
                        the ritual of the people of Israel a closely similar ritual was practised in
                        the Sinaitio peninsula. The ruins of the temple are littered with broken
                        altars for burnt sacrifice and incense ; great beds of ashes, estimated to
                        weigh fifty tons or, more, are still to be soon, the fuel for which most
                        have been brought from a great distance; a variety of broken stone tanks and
                        basins show that a whole series of ablations was required of the wo:shipper.
                        Most interesting of all, the remains of a large number of stone cubicles
                        show that the devotees of Hathor sought oracular dreams by sleeping in the
                        precious, in the hope that the goddess would reveal to them where her
                        precious blue jewels lay bid. And those who enjoyed good fortune in their
                        mining gratefully erected memorial stele or pillars to Hat bor, with
                        inscriptions of thanks that may still be read. Mr. Petrie naturally
                        illustrates this latter custom by quoting the Biblical story of Jacob's
                        dream at Bethel, and be established beyond reasonable doubt that 'the law"
                        as given by Moses was no rew invention, but a codification, as it were, of
                        ancient Semitic customs that were by no means confined to the family of
                        Abraham.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Petrie was most fortunate in his finds among the ruins, for though, when
                        the suzerainty of Egypt was no longer maintained, the Bedouin came and
                        smashed everything that could easily be broken they 1 ft the pieces behind
                        them, and in the dry climate of the desert the tooth of time has no
                        destructive edge. So he tells us how, side by side he found the ancient
                        flipt tools of the earliest workers and pieces of beautiful alabaster vares,
                        the craftsmanship of the latest dynasties. His greatest find, however, was a
                        script on the stones that <cb/> was not Egyptian, but Semitic. This script,
                        the writing, no doubt, of Syrian or Arabian servants of Egyptian masters,
                        disposes of the theory that the Hebrews were unacquainted with the art of
                        writing until they learnt it from the Egyptians, and it is not without an
                        important bearing upon Biblical criticism. It makes it almost certain that
                        the Hebrews kept records and registers of their own people long before the
                        time of their captivity in Egypt during the reign of Ramses II., from 1300
                        to 1234 B.C. And so when, under the early monarchy, the Hebrews came to
                        gather together the materials for the general history of their race, and
                        produced the books known as the Books of Moses, "all the external
                        probability shows that it was an editing of actual documents, and not merely
                        of oral tradition." And Professor Petrie adds :</p>
                    <p>"There is, indeed, also strong internal evidence that written documents were
                        used, for if only oral material was available could we except any editor of
                        such to refrain from unifying the usage of names and the varieties of style?
                        Could we expect such an editor to insert so frequently two versions of the
                        same statements only slightly altered? In such duplications and variations
                        of the text in Genesis and Exodus are the strongest proof that written
                        documents were before the editors, and that they were so ancient and revered
                        that no unification was to be tolerated."</p>
                    <p>There is one other chapter in Professor Petrie's book which is of profound
                        interest to Biblical scholars, that in which he re-examines the story of the
                        Exodus by the light of his own journeys in the peninsula. He holds that the
                        traditional view as to the direction taken by the Israelites on leaving Suez
                        is the correct one. That is to say, they turned to the south to Wady
                        Gharandel, and did not essay the crossing of the desert towards Akabah. The
                        natural oasis, where the Midianites would collect to oppose an invader, was
                        the Wady Feiran, then, as now, the most fertile spot in the whole peninsula.
                        Mr. Petrie brings good evidence to show that the climatic conditions cannot
                        have changed during the intervening three thousand years, and he holds that
                        it would be physically impossible to take a host of more than five thousand
                        people through the desert, owing to scarcity of water and supplies.
                        Population, indeed, is so scanty that the Bedouins consider that four tents
                        are sufficient to constitute a city and one a village. The author,
                        therefore, does not accept the census lists of the tribes of Israel as given
                        in Numbers i. and xxvi., or, rather, he accepts them, but makes a most
                        ingenious and plausible suggestion as to their true interpretation. Those
                        lists give a total of 603,500 at the beginning of the wanderings in the
                        desert, and of 601,700 at the close, hosts which could never have been fed
                        in such a desolate and almost waterless country. Mr. Petrie, however, points
                        out that the Hebrew word "alaf" means either "thousand," or "group," or
                        "family," and suggests that the numbers have been misread. Instead,
                        therefore, of the tribe of Reuben numbering 46,500 persons, he would read
                        that Reuben consisted of forty six families, amounting in all to 500 souls,
                        and so on through the lists. If this be done, the results are surprising,
                        for they show 598 tents or families at the first census, with 5,550 people
                        in all, an average of 9.3 to a family, and at the second census 596 tents,
                        with a total of 5,739, an average of 9.6. These are precisely the probable
                        figure; they are exactly in accord with the known historical Conditions,
                        both of the number that could leave Goshen, and the number that could live
                        in Sinai. And if it be objected that so small a band of
                        fighting-men-probably not more than 1,500-could not have captured Palestine,
                        the answer is that Palestine was a depopulated land, having suffered from
                        repeated incursions of the Egyptians, and that the Hebrews drew to
                        themselves the scattered tribes with which they came into contact. Mr.
                        Petrie's ingenious theory restores to the Biblical story the historical
                        verisimilitude, the lack of which was urged with great force by Bishop
                        Colenso in the middle of last century. It should be added that the book is

                        Reynolds has given us in the past will welcome her most recent and probably
                        best work in this line. The story is not only original, but written in an
                        attractive and distinctive style. As an idyll of the dream life of a child
                        the story shows a remarkable insight into the character and imagination of
                        children. In attempting such a work Mrs. Reynolds has dared a, most
                        difficult essay and only in the hands of one possessed of an intense love of
                        nature and in whom maternal instincts have found expression in a charming
                        literary style the authoress has demonstrated that it is possible to portray
                        such subjects without arousing any criticism usually aimed at such

                    <head>SYRIA OTTOMAN RAILWAY CO. <lb/>LADY AND THE OFFICIAL RECEIVER. </head>
                    <p>In the Chancery Division, last week, before Mr. Justice Swipfen Eady, the
                        case of Owen v. the Syria Ottoman Railway Company was heard.</p>
                    <p>This was a motion by the receiver, appointed in an action brought against the
                        company by persons claiming to be its secured creditors. The company, a
                        Turkish one, was originally formed to construct a railway from Acre to
                        Damascus, but had surrendered its concession to the Turkish Government and
                        had been wound up in England, as stated in the law report published in the
                        Times" of March 16. Of the money received from the Turkish Government on the
                        retrocession a part still remained in Constantinople, and the Courts there,
                        which did not recognize the receiver as representing the company, had given
                        judgment in favour of a lady who alleged a claim on the fand as a secured
                        creditor. 'In this she had obtained the assistance of a Mr. J. R. Pilling,
                        who, having been the promoter of the company, had convinced the Government
                        of his right to act as its representative, in which character he had
                        consented to the judgment. The object of the present application was to
                        restrain him from aiding the lady in those or further proceedings, from
                        holding meetings of the company in Constantinople (one of such meetings
                        having been called by him for Tuesday last), and from otherwise interfering
                        with the receiver. The motion also asked for his committal to prison.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cozens-Hardy appeared for the receiver; and Mr. Howard Wright also
                        supported the motion on behalf of the official receiver acting 28
                        liquidators of the company. Mr. Pilling did not appear.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Swinfen Esdy made the order in the terms asked, except for
                        committal, as to which he directed the motion to stand over.</p>

                    <p>Argentina looks like being a formidable rival of the U.S., says the
                        "Financier," not only in moat, maize and broadstaffs,but in commercial raw
                        materials. Attention is now being given to cotton growing, and the American
                        Congal General at Buenos Aires admits that Argentina's cotton zone is
                        capable of producing large crops of excellent staple. The growth of such
                        crops is no more conjecture : its certainty has been demonstrated during
                        recent years, as well as by earlier experiment. The chief drawback to
                        development is lack of labour in districts where population is sparse and
                        facilities for cheap transport are lacking.</p>

                    <head>MR. MOUROMTSEFF.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Mouromtseff is tall, broad-shouldered, but otherwise of slight build, and
                        with a fine expressive look in his clear eyes. Affable and polite, he, at
                        first sight, impresses one as being reticent and cold of bearing; but in an
                        ethical argument, when he endeavours to elucidate the truth, he is as bright
                        as a pellucid stream in the sun's rays. He is an admirable jurist, having
                        studied in the noted school of Jering, in Germany, and in Moscow, where he
                        succeeded Professor Kriloff as expounder of Roman law. At that time he was
                        twenty-five years of age.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Meuromtseff has written &amp; "History of Roman civil law" that ranks as
                        a classic, and a polemical work, "What is Justice?" which stamps him as a
                        modern innovator. He never would have given up his dry law studies were it
                        not that he forfeited his professorship by expounding liberal theses opposed
                        to autocratic rule.</p>
                    <p>The affection of his pupils sustained him in his work in the "Law Journal,"
                        where he continued to expound liberal ideas, and among the members of the
                        "Society of Jariste'' of Moscow where, during the reign of Alexander III.,
                        he strove for the maintenance of the liberties granted by Alexander II. The
                        journal was suppressed, and the society dissolved by the authorities, but it
                        only served to increase Mr. Mouromtseff's influence and reputation. People
                        opposed to him in politics consulted him juridically. Even to this day he is
                        held in high esteem as jurist by those leading officials who are antagonists
                        of his progressive ideas.</p>
                    <p>It should not, however, be assumed that Mr. Mouromtseff is at all a
                        demagogue. He is not even an orator in the strict sense of the word. His
                        words, sober, precise, and logical, are eloquent simply by reason of their
                        convincing effect. He addresses his audience in the style of a Roman jurist
                        with so apparent a love of truth that he imparts to the least important
                        subjects a tone of high elevation. His ideal constitution is that of
                        England, which he considers normal. He had already expressed his sentiments
                        in regard to it at the university in a speech on the occasion of the
                        centenary of Pouchkine, and he has developed that ideal in a scheme
                        submitted to Count Bolsky, the actual President of the Council of the
                        Empire. The formula which he has at heart, and which is also the formula of
                        the party to which he belongs, is that after having freed Russia from the
                        bureaucracy whose errors have been placed to the account of Tsarism, a
                        constitutional Tsar must remain as the guarantor of order and having the
                        same attributes as a king of England.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the future of Russia, Mr. Mouromtseff's opinion is that it
                        entirely depends on what may be the fate of the bureaucracy. It remains
                        powerful and oppressive while it disposes of the army. The only
                        counterbalance effectively opposed to it must be a unanimous juridical
                        influence. "Will the ferment now in operation among the differing sections
                        come to an end?" queries Mr. Mouromtseff. "Should armed repression engender
                        revolution, the constitutional democrats of whom I am the leader will be
                        wiped out. With a view of our programme being a success, the Dama must be
                        legislative and not consultative." For home legislation Mr. Mouromtseff and
                        his party demand universal suffrage, free speech, and a free Press, the
                        respect for individual liberty, the responsibility of Ministers to the Dums,
                        enforced primary instruction and allotment of land to country people, but on
                        terms of an equitable indemnity to the landowners. It is on this latter
                        point that the Socialist Democrats differ from the Constitutional party.
                        They demand an act of expropriation for the benefit of the country people
                        without indemnity of any kind.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mouromtseff's present aim is to bring the two antagonistic parties in
                        unison. He is assisted in that objective by the support he received from the
                        electors whose votes gained him the presidency. His study of Roman law has
                        endowed him with analytical and systematic force. He has lived on a level
                        with Roman history, the most elaborate judicial history in the world-and the
                        question is, will he succeed in imparting his own convictions to the
                        majority? Will he succeed in silencing the merely talkative members of the
                        Dama with a view of obtaining a fair hearing for the enlightened orators?
                        The srcзess of the Dams as a legislative body depends on the answer to these
                        two questions. It is either evolution or revolution-and such is the belief
                        of Mr. Mouromtseff himself. ("Globe.")</p>

                    <p>MRS. ANNA MUNDEN</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt about it that the tendancy to resort to surgical
                        operations has been too great in the past ant that this harmful tendancy is
                        growing less every day.</p>
                    <p>SURGICAL OPERATIONS AVOIDED.</p>
                    <p>Experience has demonstrated that many ailments which seemed to require
                        surgical operations in the past are now being cured by the use of harmless
                        remedies. Peruna has done as much as any other remedy to establish this very
                        important fact.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of people have been condemed to undergo surgical operations or to
                        lose their lives.</p>
                    <p>After this they have resorted to Peruna and found relief.</p>
                    <p>Other good remedes have accomplished the same result, but it is safe to
                        assume that no other remedy has equaled Peruna in its beneficent work.</p>
                    <p>Many of the alleged incurrable derangements of the pelvis are dependent upon
                        catarrh.</p>
                    <p>There is no cure for these except the remoyal of the catarrh.</p>
                    <p>Peruna seemingly works miracles in some of these cases. The explanation,
                        however, is very simple. Peruna removes the catarrh and Nature does the
                        rest.</p>
                    <p>ANNA MUNDEN, Brinkley, Ark., writes:</p>
                    <p>"I suffered with female troubles for thirteen years, and tried the best
                        doctors in Louisville, Ky., without relief.</p>
                    <p>I spent thousands of dollars at the Springs.</p>
                    <p>"The doctors desired that I have an operation performed to remove my ovaries,
                        which I would not consent to.</p>
                    <p>"I saw an advertisement of your Peruna and bought one bottle and before I had
                        taken it all I could get out of bed and walk about.</p>
                    <p>"After taking three bottles I was as well and hearty as ever.</p>
                    <p>"I gained in flesh. From 118 I increased to 186 pounds.</p>
                    <p>"If it had not been for your great and wonderful medicine, I would now be in
                        my grave.</p>
                    <p>"I would advise all women sufferers to try it.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Caroline Kramer, Fort Collins, Col., writes:</p>
                    <p>"The majority of women who are suffering from disordered periods and other
                        troubles, have such strong faith in doctors that they allow them to
                        experiment on them for kidney, liver, or stomach troubles, until they become
                        discouraged and their money is gone.</p>
                    <p>"This was my unfortunante experience for nearly two years, when my attention
                        was called to Peruna.</p>
                    <p>"I hardly dared believe that at last I had found the right medicine, but as I
                        kept on using it and was finally cured I could only thank God and take
                        courage.</p>
                    <p>SATISFACTORY RESULTS FROM PE-RU-NA</p>
                    <p>"I have had most satisfying results from the use of your medicine and have
                        advised dozens of women who were suffering with woman's ills to use Peruna
                        and let the doctors alone, and those who have followed my advice are better
                        to-day and many are fully restored to health."</p>

                    <head>INHUMATIONS PRECIPITATES.</head>
                    <p>Un meeting vient d'être tenu à Londres par l'Association contre les
                        inhumations précipitées, où ont été exposés quantité de faits vraiment
                        effroyables.</p>
                    <p>Le docteur Stenson Hooken a la a l'assemblée en mémoire faisant un lugubre
                        dénombrement de cas de mort apparente en suite desquelles l'inhumation avait
                        été ordonnée.</p>
                    <p>Le docteur Hooken a ajouté que, dans sa carrière en Angleterre, il a souvent
                        découvert que l'extrême bate que l'on mettait généralement dans les
                        funérailles avait souvent occasionné de ces horribles méprises.</p>
                    <p>Il a produit multitude de cas où l'exhumation avait fait découvrir que les
                        présumés morts étaient encore en vie quand ils ont été mis dans la tombe. En
                        voici la lugubre statistique:</p>
                    <p>Enterrés en vie, 149; échappés au dernier moment à l'inhumation précipitée,
                        219; disséqués alors que la vie existait encore, 10; re. Condos en vie,
                        tandis qu'on allait procéder à la dissection, 3; embaumés vivants, %; brûlé
                        vivant, 1. Cette statistique est d'autant plus épouvantable, qu'on ne peut
                        compter que deux exhumations sur cent mille corps enterrés dans le
                        Royaume-Uni. Combien donc d'erreurs ont pu se produire, qui n'ont jamais pu
                        être reconnues!</p>
                    <p>Il relate que quand on a remué les terres de vieux cimetière, quantité de
                        corps ont été trouvés dont la position pouvait certainement laisser conclure
                        qu'ils avaient été enterrés. tandis que la vie subsistait.</p>
                    <p>Le docteur Hooken cite encore le cas d'un enfant de cinq ans, dont le décès
                        est déclaré. Quand on vint pour enlever le corps, on 80 tronya en présence
                        de l'enfant jouant avec les floors qu'on avait posées sur son linceul. La
                        mère, qui était atteinte d'une maladie de cœur, fut tellement émotionnée par
                        le retour à la vie de son cher petit, qu'elle mourut subitement.</p>
                    <p>Les conclusions du docteur sont que, comme en Allemagne, on ne procède aux
                        inhumations que lorsque les premiers signes de putréfaction apparaissent sur
                        le corps. Il préconise ainsi la mise en contact d'un doigt da soppo é décédé
                        avec une batterie électrique, de façon à ce quo pendant la veillée du corps,
                        le moindre signe de vio puisse immédiatement être enregistré. Il y a on, on
                        Allemangne, a-t-il dit, plusieurs sauvetages dus à cette précaution.</p>
                    <p>En suite de ce rapport, l'Association pour prévenir les inhumations
                        précipitées a adopté une résolution tendant à ce qu'aucun certificat de
                        décès ne fut reconnu valable avant qu'on examen supplémentaire ait été fait
                        par un praticien spécial, et qu'en attendant l'inhumation, des chambres
                        mortos très d'attente fassent établies pour que la surveillance des cas de
                        survivance possibles puisse être dûment assurée.</p>
                    <p>Nous ne croyons pas qu'il soit un pays où une association semblable ait
                        raison d'être comme en Égypte. La chaleur qui active la décomposition et
                        peut, de ce fait, amener des épidémies dangereuses, oblige à enterrer les
                        cadavres, pour employer l'expression, encore chauds.</p>
                    <p>Qu'une personne meure le matin : le soir même, le lendemain an plus tard, on
                        procède aux funérailles; or il est un fait avéré, de l'avis de tous les
                        docteurs, qu'en certaines maladies la décomposition seule peut amener la
                        constatation de la mort.</p>
                    <p>Il suffit de jeter les yeux sur la statistique du Docteur Hooken pour se
                        persuader que le ou d'ensevelissement vivant, étant donné la précipitation
                        avec laquelle on procède, a dû se produire en Égypte. Depuis quelque temps
                        on s'occupa fort d'édifier aa Caire un four crématoire pour la destruction
                        des cadavres ; ne serait-il pas plus argent de constraire à l'instar de
                        l'Allemagne une chambre d'attente qui permettrait, dans les cas douteux,
                        d'obtenir une certitude absolu de décès.</p>
                    <p>Une idée semblable aurait certainement tous les suffrages, car, s'il est une
                        crainte que l'on puisse avoir, c'est celle d'être enterré vif.</p>

                    <p>"Whether," said the Chief Boatman, reflectively, "midshipmen or monkeys is
                        the most to mischievous is a thing I've never rightly wh sorted out, so to
                        speak, in my head." He was off duty, and seated on the low wooden bench slit
                        in front of the whitewashed wall surrounding the coastguard-station, which
                        looks out over he the estuary, where all the ships of all the the world pass
                        to and fro upon their various ou Occasions. To the eastward the pale yellow
                        all gold of the sandbanks showed up in patches, fas as the ebb tide left
                        them bare, lipped and edged by a creamy ribbon of foam, which marked the
                        line between them and the clear ba green water which rustled around the
                        great a buoys marking the channels, and chattered past the bluff bows of the
                        squat, red-painted rig light vessels. Southward, a giant crane and an
                        indistinct blur of masts and funnels indicated the great naval port some
                        four miles away; while west, a spider-legged pier crept seaward tip in its
                        monstrous length. There was a pleasant hum of insects in the flowering gorse
                        in front the of the low bank on which the station stands, th and the silent
                        summer peace was only broken by the tramp of the coast guardsman on duty
                        over the shell-strewn path on which he kept cig his watch over sea and land.
                        The Chief Boatman pulled out his ancient pipe, but the stranger offered him
                        a cigar, which he graciously accepted, saying, however, at the same time: "I
                        doubt it won't have much taste to the likes of' me, sir, what's accustomed
                        to 'ship's" (ie., tobacco).</p>
                    <p>"You were saying," remarked the stranger, "that midshipmen- "Was limbs of
                        Satan, if I recollect rightly, and don't you make no mistake about that
                        there: likewise monkeys, which is own brothers to 'em. In Singapore Roads it
                        were, one time, I recollect, than we ad a fair old razz'e-dezzle along of a
                        midship man and a monkey. The mid, 'e goes ashorefor once 'is leave not
                        bein' stopped-and when he comes off he brings with 'im a monkey, a fair,
                        active, middle- iz 3d sort o' monkey, what could race about the riggin' like
                        forty mad maintopmen lashed into ore. He goes to the Firat Lootenant, and 'e
                        Bays: If you please, sir, I've brought a monkey aboard, and 'e's a very
                        'armless kind o' monkey, and I wants to take 'im 'om 3 to my ms.' Now, the
                        First Lootenant, 'e 'ad a sort of a likin' for this young fir limb, so 'e
                        says, 'Very well,' 'e says, 'when the Captain comes aboard to-morrow I'll
                        ask him if you may keep him.' Well, that night the monkey got loose, an'
                        found 'is way under the t'gall'n fo'o'sl, where Chippy, that's the carpenter
                        you understand, and 'is men 'ad been work ing, and had left a medium-sized
                        glue-pot, with the glue in it, what was still liquid. The monkey goes
                        moseyin' around, and presently 'e shoves 'is hand into the glue-pot, up to
                        his d wrist, and 'owever it was, I can't say, but he couldn't get his 'and
                        out of it. Well, he starts in a tearin' and a rampagin' round under the
                        fo'c'sl, where the men was in their 'ammocks fast asleep, and first one
                        wakes up and then another, and ses one to another like, 'What's up, now;
                        what's broke loose? At last they turns out, and Ginger Jones, what was a
                        ordinary sesman, sings out, Strike me pink, if it ain't a monkey with the
                        boxin' gloves on.' With that the crowd gets a move on 'em, and chases that
                        there monkey till 'e takes to the riggin', and they goos back to their
                        'ammocks. The quartermaster, what 'ad the first watch, didn't take much
                        notice, but says, 'Well, if the blighter 'as gone aloft, just let 'im stop
                        there. This was at ten o'clock, and when 'is relief comes up at midnight, 'e
                        clean forgot all about the monkey, and see nothin' about 'im.</p>
                    <p>"Well, about one in the mornin' the ship's corporal, what 'ad the middle
                        watch, comes up from the galley with two basins o’ boilin’' cocos. one for
                        'isse'f, and one for the quartermaster. 'Ere, Bill,' 'a sings out, "'ere's a
                        little drop of all right for to warm you up. Standin' in the gangway, 'e
                        was, with his lantern in one hand, stretched out above the basin o' cocoa,
                        what was in 'is left. Bill, 'e pats out 'is hand for to take the cocoa, when
                        the monkey, wot was a settin' on the mainyard, immediately over their 'eads,
                        at this pertiklar moment, gets his hand out of the glue-pot; it come down
                        what straight as a die on top of the lantern what was one o' them
                        old-fashioned iron and glass things, with a parser's dip inside, and smashes
                        it to atoms, an' not only that, it drives the iron bottom o' the lantern
                        through the basin o' cocoa, breaks the basin, and scalds the ship's corporal
                        and the quartermaster somethink cruel. They sets to work a holleria' and
                        swear in', till the First Lootenant comes out of his cabin to find out what
                        all the row's about.</p>
                    <p>"Next day the Captain didn't come off, bat sends word to 'ave steam ready on
                        the engines, and the anchor short-stay, at one o'clock, all ready to weigh
                        when 'e comes aboard; and in the meanwhile nobody couldn't find the monkey,
                        nor see 'im nowheres, and 80'e was sort of forgotten, 'cept by the
                        quartermaster and the ship's corporal, what was scalded. Well, at one
                        o'clock aboard comes the Captain. All ready to weigh, sir!' says 'All right!
                        an: wers the Captain; 'did you get that parchment of confidential despatches
                        wot I sent off yesterday ?' 'Yes, Bir,' says No. 1, 'and the paymaster, 'e
                        'as them locked up in the ship's office.' The Captain goes into his cabin,
                        and in one moment 'e's out, ragin' and swearin'. 'Where's the First
                        Lootenant? Who's been in my cabin ?' he sings out. What's up, sir ?' sings
                        oat No. 1. You come here and look,' answers the skipper. I must tell you
                        that 'e was a mighty particular officer, was the skipper, an' 'ad a
                        beautiful cabin, with a white carpet, with crimson rugs. No. 1, 'e goes in,
                        and there's the big inkpot, wot held about a pint of ink, lying bottom up in
                        the middle of the cabin, all the blottin' paper and the Navy List torn up,
                        like for a paperchase, an' the ink runnin’ about in rivers. 'Who has
                        perpetrated this ere <cb/>outrage ?' asks the skipper ; and No. 1, 'o looks
                        blank, till at that moment the monkey skips op from behind a chair, and
                        darts oat o' the port. Well, they swabs up the ink, and picks up the paper,
                        and goas on the poop for to get the ship underway, when the skipper, .what
                        was standin' in the starboard dicky, very angry and cross like, sings out,
                        'Who's that: Blingin' things out o' the main deck port, there, contrary to
                        order"; and then, 'Good Heavens!' he says to No. 1, 'there's someone
                        throwing them despatches overboard !' and, as bespoke, out o' the port comes
                        a big parchment envelope, all tore to bits, and a shower of envelopes, all
                        fastened down with big red seals. "Jerusalem!" says No. 1, it's that
                        blighted monkey again, I'll bot a pint.' And so it war, sure enough ; but,
                        Lord, they couldn't catch 'im, not for a week, they couldn't, and by the
                        Captain's orders that there mid spent all is time in the riggin' after the
                        monkey, save when he was at his meals or in his 'ammock."</p>
                    <p>"What come to the monkey.?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, after a week of chasing 'e missed 'is tip, did the monkey, an' fell
                        off the gaff o' the maintopgail, into the sea, just as the mid. thought 'e'd
                        grabbed him at last. I tell you that there ship was not 'ove to for to pick
                        up that monkey."</p>
                    <p>The Chief Boatman paused, and re-lit his cigar, which had gone out. "But I
                        thought it was midshipmen you started to talk about ?" questioned the
                        stranger.</p>
                    <p>"And if I talks about monkeys, which is the most mischievousness," was the
                        somewhat cryptic and superlative reply. "But I seen a torn-out down to.
                        Devonport Dockyard by midshipmen what boat monkeys bellow."</p>
                    <p>What was that ?" "Well, we was fittin' oat in a corvette, and we'd got the
                        lower yards across, topmasts fidded, and riggin' eet up, an' the First

                        the senior mid and says, 'You go ashore into the dockyard, and try an' learn
                        something aboat steam.' So off they goes, six of 'em. They splits op into
                        two parties of three, and the lot what I'm talkin' about, they gets into
                        convorsation with a man wot was drivin' a slephant What's &amp; elephanti
                        It's a sort of locomotive on wheels, what drags chain cables and snch like
                        heavy weights about a dockyard. Wel, the elephant man was very kind to the
                        youngeters, an' showa 'on how to start, and how to stop, and how to go
                        astern, and how to fire ap, and where the steam went from the boiler to the
                        engine, and all the rest of it: Next thing, the big bell rings at noon, and
                        the elephant man, 'o goes off to 'is dinner. 'As we knows 'ow to start 'er
                        and stop 'or and steer 'er,' says the senior mid., 'I votes we gets aboard,
                        and as a ride.' So said, eo done ; and the senior mid. 'e takes the steerin'
                        wheel, for all the world like ono of these 'ere motor cars, and gives 'is
                        orders : Fall speed aboad!'One o' the other youngsters lots steam oa to the
                        engine, and oft they goes, in grand style. "Stop 'er ! sings ont the senior
                        mid., 'S:op 'er, you silly fool!' 'She won't stop ! bleated the other one ;
                        and, to make a long story short, Dono of 'em could remember 'ow it was done.
                        Then they gets frightened. 'Let's jump off aforo she goes too fast !'
                        soggested one of 'em, and next minute they was off."</p>
                    <p>"What happened ?" asked the stranger, breathlessly.</p>
                    <p>The Chief Boatman grinned. "I'm tellin' you : ahead of her was a brand new
                        graving dock, what was forty-five foot six inches from sill to floor, and
                        that blighted old elephant, what weighed nigh on to three tone, she just
                        puffed ca'mly ap and over the edge Land dropped the whole of that forty-five
                        foot six inches, onto the granite floor. With that out come the whole

                        tracks To the old elephant spread out all over the floor of that there
                        dock."</p>
                    <p>"But what happened to the midshipmen ; didn't they catch it ?” asked the
                        stranger.</p>
                    <p>"It's very evident," answered the Chief Boatman, tolerantly, "that you 'ave
                        no experience of the likes of them. Why, radshanks wasn't in it with the way
                        them young limbs out their lacky, and five minutes after the orach the

                        more, to this day no one never found out who doing it.</p>
                    <p>The Chief Boatman rose, and throw away the end of his cigar. Now I must go in
                        and have my tes, as I come on duty at six; some day, it you're this way
                        again, sir, I will spin you the yarn of what the midI, shipmen did in the
                        Sunda Straits." 1. </p>
                    <p>The stranger strolled off homeware, meditating profoundly on the ways of

                    <p>The "Vossische Zeitung '' reports that the visit which the German Emperor's
                        brother-in-law, Duke Ernest Günther of Schleswig-Holstein, recently paid to
                        Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria came to an abrupt and unexpected termination.
                        Duke Ernest Günther, in proposing the toast of the Bulgarian Army, at a
                        banquet given in his honour at Sofia by Prince Ferdinand, was reported to
                        have said that the Bulgarians were the Japanese of the Near East. It was
                        further stated that this and other utterances of the Dake gave offence to
                        the t Sultan of Turkey.</p>
                    <p>When the report of Dake Ernest Günther's speeches at Sofia reached Berlin, by
                        way of Constantinople, the Emperor immediately telegraphed to his

                        The Vossische Zeitung' demands an official explanation whether the rumours

                    <p>In the German journal "Philologus" for 1905 Herr Ausfeld has an article
                        interesting to inhabitants of Alexandria upon the quarter of the city known,
                        in Roman times, by the duplicate titles of Neapolis and Broucheion; for ty a
                        topographical dissertation he proves they were partly identical.</p>
                    <p>Broucheion, from Παρουχεῖον "wheat granary," a name given, in derision, to
                        the district in which the Museum and Library being situate should have been
                        the seat of culture, was a title which became popular during the Roman
                        epoch. The quarter, however, did include the chief granaries, and lay along
                        the Dromos; therefore must have partly corresponded with the new city, or
                        Neapolis.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, during the first three centuries of our era the terms were used for
                        the same quarter of the town: Neapolis being the official, and Broucheion,
                        the popular, and at first derisive, name.</p>
                    <p>After the destruction Alexandria suffered under Aurelian, the name Broucheion
                        continued until well into the fourth century and then ceased to be used,
                        whilst the official "Neapolis” was the appellation up to the date of the

                    <head>PALESTINE FOR THE JEWS.</head>
                    <p>Presiding at the first meeting of the British Federation of the Jewish
                        Territorial Organization held last week, Mr. Israel Zangwill said the
                        organization was to-day world-wide, with branches in Europe, Asia, Africa,
                        America, and Australia. A branch was even about to be formed in East Africa,
                        while one of the strongest branches was in Palestine. Not only had the
                        British Government now formally expressed its willingness to treat with the
                        Ito, but Mr. Chamberlain had empowered him to say that, so far as his
                        Parliamentary influence went, the Opposition would cordially support
                        whatever his Majesty's Government might decide to do for the Jewish people.
                        They were in the market to day for a territory and if Palestine could be
                        obtained on an autonomous basis their programme was fulfilled to perfection.
                        If, on the other hand, their opponents could not show them how to get
                        Palestine, it was equally their duty to the Jewish people to come over and
                        help them. The international council would meet in the summer, and a
                        practical decision would probably be taken. When their scheme was ripe a
                        Jewish loan would be raised. They were tired of talk; they had seen too many
                        Russian corpses. They wanted to see a land to which the Jewish wanderer
                        might turn his steps, knowing that he want to a land of rest. Mr. Lucien
                        Wolf moved the following resolution;-"That this mass meeting of London Jews
                        and of delegates 5 from leading towns of Great Britain and Ireland records
                        its conviction that the unhappy condition of the Jewish people in many parts
                        of the world and the increasing volume of Jewish emigration urgently demand
                        the provision of a territory upon an autonomous basis for those Jews who are
                        unwilling or unable to remain in their present lands, and pledges itself to
                        promote by every means in its power the acquisition of such a legally
                        assured place of Jewish settlement." The resolution was seconded by Mr. C.
                        Salzberger, trustee of the United Hebrew Charities of America, and
                        adopted.</p>

                        close of last year.</p>
                    <p>Three second lieutenants of the King's Royal Rifle Corps have been promoted
                        lieutenants-Lieutenants G. M. Atkinson, W.J. ! Davis, and A. D. Borton. The
                        latter two are with the 2nd Battalion at Ranikhet and the latter with the
                        3rd Battalion at Aldershot.</p>
                    <p>Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., has been appointed a
                        Colonel Commandant of the Royal Engineers in succession to the late
                        Lieutenant General Sir T. L. J. Gallway, K C.M.G. The gallant sappers will
                        feel honoured by this appointment of "K. of K.", to their distinguished
                        corps.</p>
                    <p>When the U. Battery R.H.A. recently left Christchurch for Cairo, it was
                        intimated that that pleasant station would cease to be &amp; R.H.A. station,
                        and that it would be taken over by the Royal Engineer. This, however, has
                        fallen through, and the K. Battery R.H.A., after gunnery, will proceed to
                        Christobarob, and Manchester will cease to be a horse artillery station.</p>
                    <p>Considerable interest is being taken in the firing of the Mediterranean
                        Fleet. Lord Charles Beresford is a great gunnery enthusiast, and the
                        performance of his flagship, the battleship Bulwark, will be closely
                        watched, after the fine shooting of the other flagships.</p>
                    <p>When the Cape Squadron is amalgamated with the East Indies Squadron, the
                        latter will patrol the same between the Cape and the Red -Sez. Io event,
                        however, of the Suez Canal not being available in war-time, the naval
                        establishment at Simonstown will be kept on a 3 reduced footing, so that it
                        can be filled up at short notice. Apart from the grounds of economy, the
                        maintenance of a squadron at The Cape and expansive establishments ashore
                        Jis not justified by the prezent international outlook Bo say the apologists
                        for the reduction. How many foresaw the Tabah incident ?</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
