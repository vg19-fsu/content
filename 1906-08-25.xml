                        <p>The newspapers report that Mr. Bryan, the probable candidate in the
                            future presidential elections in the United States, was disappointed to
                            find that in the Museum at Cairo, the greater part of the explanatory
                            inscriptions were in French, a language that Mr. Bryan does not know. If
                            he had only frequented the schools founded by Mr. Berlitz, his
                            illustrious compatriot, he would not have lived to-day to deplore his
                            misfortune. How many people perhaps are in the same case as this
                            American, but happily, thanks to the Berlitz system, they can rapidly
                            put themselves above such a con-tingency, and avoid mishaps even more
                            serious than this which we report. [Advt.]</p>

                    <p>The whole village of Kom Elris, in the district of Tahta, has been destroyed
                        by a huge fire which broke out yesterday evening.</p>
                    <p>A strong wind was blowing at the time, and this beginning at one end fanned
                        the flames in all directions, the conflagration being helped by the maize
                        stalks stored on the roofs of the doomed dwellings.</p>
                    <p>It was a most awful spectacle, the glare being visible at a great distance,
                        and so rapidly did the surge of flame envelop the village that the

                    <p>The Cairo police are waging as keen and determined a struggle against
                        gambling as are the Alexandria police against immorality.</p>
                    <p>The latest move of the police in the Capital is directed against the game of
                        poker, and it is probable that a test case will be brought before the Mixed
                        Courts in order that a legal decision may be obtained as to whether this
                        popular game is a mischievous form of gambling or merely a permissible
                        distraction. We believe that as the law stands at present poker is
                        allowed.</p>
                    <p>"Al Mokattam" says that the police encounter great obstacles in their
                        endeavours to completely suppress gambling in Egypt. Whenever they pounce
                        down upon gamblers the latter always say that they are only having a game of
                        poker, and as up to now that game does not come within the purview of the
                        police, they are powerless to interfere. If they can get the Courts to hold
                        poker as an illicit game of chance it is thought that a great step forward
                        in the abolition of gambling will have been made.</p>
                    <p>The present series of police campaigns is due to an accord that has been
                        arrived at with some of the Consuls. When the Capitutions are abolished the
                        powers of the police will of course be far wider than they are at present,
                        and it is expected that stern and repressive measures will be taken in many
                        directions in order to raise the tons of morality all round.</p>

                        Alexandria has evoked numerous tokens of respect for the late Colonel
                        McKinstry.The "Army and Navy Gazette" remarks:-</p>
                    <p>The painfully sudden death of Colonel A. W. McKinstry has left vacant once
                        more the appointment of commandant of the Duke of York's Royal Military
                        Sobool. Col. McKinstry went to Chelsea three years ago, having been selected
                        for the charge of the school when the late Colonel Forrest retired. Matters
                        at that time were not in the happiest condition, as there had been much
                        wrangling over the re- moval schemes, and a good deal of friction had been
                        the result, but the new "chief" came on to the scene with an open mind, and
                        the effect of his appointment soon became evident by the progress which was
                        made in settling matters to the advantage of the institution. Colonel
                        McKinstry had the school in the best of order, and possessed the confidence
                        of a loyal and industrious staff. H.R.H the Duke of Connaught, at his recent
                        inspection, paid a high compliment to the school, and laid stress on the
                        excellent feeling which pervaded all under Colonel McKinstry's influence. It
                        Was a compliment which was deserved. All who know the Duke of York's School
                        will extend their sympathy to staff and scholars alike in the great loss
                        they have sustained at a moment when the services of such a commandant could
                        ill be spared, in view of the arrangements which will shortly have to be
                        made for the Transfer of the school to its new and up to date quarters at
                        Dover.</p>

                        unfortunately, Little Englanders are only too glad to support those who are
                        trying to calumniate their Mother Country, but it is somewhat remarkable
                        that our confrère should accept the title of leader of a party the existence
                        of which he has denied. On two occasions in April of this year Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel lamented the non-existence of a Nationalist party. In the issue
                        of "Al-Lewa" of the 9th of that month he wrote. :-</p>
                    <p>"Local Egyptians should consider the advisability of forming an independent
                        patriotic political party to plead for the country's cause and to prepare
                        public opinion in such a way as to make it a living force before which the
                        Government would submit. This is the only way to form a representative body.
                        So long as we remain a nation of different projects we will never succeed,
                        though we cry day and night for a representative body. Governments never
                        delegate their powers to the people unless they know that they will greatly
                        suffer by defying public opinion. Let us prove by deeds and not by words
                        that we are alive and that to disobey our wishes is an unpardonable
                        offence."</p>
                    <p>Three days later, referring to the formation of the Heliopolis Oasis Company,
                        our contemporary remarked:-</p>
                    <p>"The Government does all things contrary to the interests of the nation,
                        ignoring the fact that the land belongs to the nation and that it (the
                        Government) is only an administrator. Had the Egyptians a political party in
                        their service, that party would have raised its voice in every quarter of
                        the world against these measures and would have proved the necessity of
                        forming a Constitution, and that to leave the fate of the country to a few
                        Englishmen is to throw it to the bottom of an abyss, where the light of life
                        and liberty cannot reach it."</p>
                    <p>In England Mustapha Pasha Kamal masquerades as the leader of a large party,
                        and in Egypt he bemoans the fact that he has no party to lead. Some may,
                        indeed do, believe him when he talks of a suppressed people whose interests
                        are altogether disregarded by their Government, and there is, no doubt, a
                        leaven in Egypt which is prepared to vociferate as loudly as himself, should
                        occasion offer. Facts, however, are as equally patent to the Egyptians as to
                        ourselves, and so the Pasha is unable to obtain any useful support. The
                        prosperity which has arisen in this country is so self-evident that it is
                        quite natural that Mustapha Pasha should not succeed in raising a party for
                        the reversal of the country's political status. We quite agree with him in
                        his confession of the non-existence of such a party, though where he laments
                        we rejoice, in the interests of the people.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir,-A short time ago a remarkable letter appeared in the "Egyptian
                            Gazette" from the Rev. Peter Rudolph on the subject of the Alexandria
                            City Police's present crusade against immorality in this city. In that
                            letter the writer stated that "Miralai Hopkinson Bey has been most
                            successful in his campaign against fast women, and his endeavours to
                            raise the moral tone of Alexandria should be seconded by all the public
                            spirited members of the population." Mr. Radolph also says that he and
                            Miralai Hopkinson Bey were the only members of the International
                            Association "who had any practical experience of how to save girls from
                            a vicious life." I do not wish to contest, in any degree, the truth of
                            these tributes to Miralai Hopkinson Bey's noble attempts to improve the
                            standard of morality in Alexandria, and I would be the last to throw
                            cold water on the crusade against the Demon of Imparity which he is
                            leading in the best interests of this great city. At the same time I
                            should like to observe that however great may be the experience of the
                            Comman- dant of Police in this work, it would be advis- able that his
                            lieutenants should exercise a little discretion. Of course their
                            puritanical zeal may be very ardent, but it should be tempered with some
                            discretion, as is shown by an incident of which I was an observer. A few
                            nights ago I was enjoying the fresh air of the early evening at an
                            open-air café not far from the Windsor Hotel. It was about 10 o'clock
                            and near me, seated in a chair, was a quietly-dressed young woman
                            evidently belonging to the café. She was in fact, I believe, some
                            relation of the proprietor. She was soberly dressed and showed no signs
                            of being in any degree fast. The place was railed off from the public
                            thoroughfare as is usual. A policeman, evidently belonging to the
                            Morality Department, entered and, going straight up to the lady, asked
                            her several questions in Arabic. From what I understood he asked her
                            where she came from, etc. The scene was noticed by several people who
                            happened to be present, and we all sympathised with the very awkward
                            position in which the young woman was placed. I should like to know if
                            the puritanical vigilance of the police includes every person of the
                            female gender who happens to be out in the evening (even in an enclosed
                            area such as a café) as being ipso facto suspicious. However much I may
                            approve of the high ideals of social parity at which the Alexandria
                            Police aim, I can hardly bring himself to believe that Miralai Hopkinson
                            Bey can countenance such excessively zealous methods. Why should a
                            policeman dare to question a young woman whose conduct was propriety
                            itself and who was moreover not in a public thoroughfare? If such a
                            system is coun- tenanced by the police authorities it will only serve to
                            irritate the public who might otherwise have been only too glai to lend
                            their support to Miralai Hopkinson Bey's struggle with sexual
                            impurity.-I am, etc., </p>

                        <p>Sir,-While thoroughly agreeing with the letter of "Anti-Pseudo-Patriot"
                            which appeared in your issue of the 21st inst. I should like to point
                            out that there exists a very sure and simple antidote to the poison with
                            which the "notorious agitator" has for so long been dosing this docile
                            race. The Egyptian is a great stickler for points of etiquette and is
                            possessed of admirable manners which he much appreciates in others
                            irrespective of race and creed. English inspectors might well adopt a
                            more conciliatory attitude in the course of their "maroor." A polite
                            "good-day" costs the wisher no loss to his dignity nor to his authority
                            and is invariably greeted with a choras of replies such as "Ahlan wa
                            sahlan" and so forth, and leaves a good impression behind.</p>
                        <p>The idea of many Englishmen that any unbending on their part incurs a
                            diminution of their prestige is a very false one. The happy mean between
                            aloofness and familiarity should be aimed at by all. Yours etc. </p>

                        has merely thrown out his proposals for discussion. If Egyptian opinion as a
                        whole be favourable to them, the matter may reach a farther stage; if it is
