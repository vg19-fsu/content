                    <head> THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.</head>
                    <p>This morning's telegrams show that, as far at least as St. Petersburg is
                        concerned, the revolutionary movement has been stamped out with ruthless
                        severity. But in the provinces the state of affairs is by no means so
                        reassuring for the supporters of autocracy. The immense arsenals at
                        Sebastopol are in flames, riots have occurred at Riga, a general strike has
                        been proclaimed at Moscow for Thursday next, and from the Black Sea to the
                        Baltic the country is seething with sullen discontent or open rebellion. The
                        complex nature of the Russian is dominated by one fundamental inclination to
                        pursue an idea to its utmost limits. When a Russian has got hold of a
                        thought, a fundamental principle, or purpose, whether it originated with
                        himself, or was borrowed from outside, he does not rest until he has
                        followed it to the end. It is this which has made the Russians the most
                        arbitrary oppressors and the most reckless liberators in the world, blindly
                        orthodox, yet pursuing strange sectarian beliefs even to self-destruction,
                        carrying free thought to Nihilism, and sedition to murder and the flinging
                        of dynamite. If they still preserve a belief in authority, they bow their
                        foreheads to the earth. If they have conceived a hatred for that same
                        authority they do not hesitate to use the revolver or the bomb. In all
                        things they are radical; in faith, in infidelity, in love and in hate, in
                        submission and in rebellion. Such is the Russian nature, and it is not of
                        such that thralls are made. The existing system of government in Russia up
                        to now has been enthroned upon a live volcano, whose pent up and gathering
                        forces have now begun to find their vent. Perhaps the most significant piece
                        of news in our telegrams is that concerning the Tsar. Hitherto he has been
                        considered by the mass of his subjects as a sacrosanct figure, standing in
                        the position of common father to the lower classes of the people. But the
                        veil which has hitherto concealed him from his people's eye is now for ever
                        drawn aside and the Autocrat of All the Russias, "whose exact whereabouts,"
                        so the telegrams state, "is unknown," has been convicted of blood
                        guiltiness, and as Father Gapon declared yesterday to the people: "We have
                        now no Emperor. Innocent blood lies between him and the people," thousands
                        of whom he has not <cb n="6"/> hesitated to send to slaughter at the hands
                        of his own troops :--</p>
                    <p>Ghehazi by the hue that chills thy cheek</p>
                    <p>And ilate by the hue that sears thine hand Whene all earth's water cannot
                        wash the brand That signs thy soul a manslayer's though thou speak All
                        Christ, wit. lips most murderous and most meek.</p>
                    <p>The future depends entirely on the attitude of the army, for, as Gibbon
                        points out in a celebrated passage, a hundred thousand men directed by a
                        coutralised despotism can hold down a hundred millious of discontented but
                        disorganised subjects. But there are signs that the temper of the common
                        soldier cannot be entirely relied upon. Yesterday an eutire regimeut refused
                        to leave St. Petersburg to quell the disturbances at Riga. Another regiment
                        lowered its arms when ordered to fire on the people on Sunday afternoon.
                        Such incidents are of extreme significauce, and just as Napoleon said, with
                        memorable insight, that the old régime in France received its death-blow
                        from Frederick the Great at the battle of Rossbach, BO Muscovite autocracy
                        may prove to have received its mortal wound upon the fields of Manchuria;
                        and the renaissance of an Asiatic people will result, by the oblique and
                        strange processes of fate, in precipitating a convulsion which will affect
                        the Governments, excite the peoples of all neighbouring countries, and shake
                        the Continent to the centre. History, classic and modern, teaches no clearer
                        lesson than this, as important to popular parties in democratic States as to
                        despotic rulers, that disasters in foreign policy have been the surest
                        causes of the overthrow of political systems.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>UNHAPPY STATE EMPLOYES. </head>
                    <p>More than a week ago we published a petition addressed by the employés of the
                        Telegraph Administration to the Cairo authorities, at the same time calling
                        our readers' attention to the statements put forward, while making no
                        comment on them. We wished to give a reasonable time for reply before doing
                        this, although we believe a fortnight had already elapsed without any notice
                        whatever having been taken of the petition. We therefore feel justified in
                        assuming the truth of the charges made, and in examining their bearing on
                        the question of the way in which this important public department is
                        conducted. If, in the course of future remarks, we speak out somewhat
                        plainly and ruffle certain feathers, so much the better; while if the facts
                        differ from the statements published in the petition, the absence of
                        contradiction is alone to blame for our being misled.</p>

                            <p>Yesterday is known as "Vladimir's Day," being the name of the Tsar's
                                uncle, the Grand Duke Vladimir, a notoriously violent reactionary,
                                to whom his Majesty confided the maintenance of order.</p>
                            <p>The exact whereabouts of the Tsar is unknown. The information is
                                carefully concealed.</p>
                            <p>The ruthless firing on unarmed crowds has horrified the public. On
                                all sides one hears scathing comparisons between the bravery of the
                                military against the defenceless public and their conduct in
                                Manchuria.</p>
                            <p>The former mutual distrust between the educated reformers and the
                                workmen has vanished.</p>
                            <p>The novelist Maxime Gorki, addressing a meeting of Liberals
                                associated with himself and Father Gapon, said that the revolution
                                had commenced and would continue.</p>
                            <p>Father Gapon, who is unhurt and in hiding, has written to his
                                comrades saying : "We have now no Emperor, innocent blood lies
                                between him and the people. Hurrah for the beginning of the people's
                                battle for freedom. I will be with you this evening."</p>
                            <p>The proceedings last night at Vassili Ostrow are still shrouded in
                                mystery. It is reported that the troops invaded the quarter shooting
                                and sabring every one they met. Some estimates give the casualties
                                as 2,000 killed and 5,000 wounded. No official statement has yet
                                been issued on the subject.</p>
                            <p>Large fires have broken out near the Warsaw Railway Station.</p>
                            <p>People are amazed at the colossal blunder of the Government in
                                neglecting such an opportunity for strengthening the people's
                                affection for the autocracy. Millions of workmen have been added to
                                the ranks of the intellectual malcontents.(Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>The special train conveying the Holy Carpet t arrived at Suez at 3 o'clock
                        this afternoon, and on arrival of the train at the station, a saluté of 21
                        guns was fired from the fort. Thousands of pilgrims, mingling with the
                        natives of Suez, paraded the streets with flags, and the town presented a
                        lively aspect</p>
                    <p>At about 4 o'clock the procession of the Holy Carpet took place. It was
                        escorted by cavalry, infantry, and artillery, numbering 407 officers and
                        men, under the command of Miralai Mohamed Bey Rifaat, as well as by
                        detachments of Coast Guards, and the military band. Towards evening the
                        Mahmal was con-veyed to the docks by the same special train, to be placed on
                        board the Khédivial steamer ' Rahmanieh," which is due to sail on Wednesday
                        for Jeddah.</p>
                    <p>This is a record year for the pilgrimage on account of the large number of
                        Egyptian pilgrims, which exceeds 16,000, as against</p>
                    <p>12.000 last year.</p>
                    <p>The pilgrims are conveyed by the Khédivial steamers to Tor, where they purge
                        five days' quarantine, and thence the same company's steamers carry them on

                    <head>CHRONIQUE FINANCIERE</head>
                    <p>La semaine avait bien débuté, avec tendance marquée à la hausse, lorsque
                        toutrà-ooup l'apris#-midi du 19, une réaction s'est produite, causée par les
                        réalisations et les nouvelles politiquw inquiétantes. Les dépéchas d'hier
                        ont fait dégénérer le recul en vraie débandade.</p>
                    <p>Trop vite oublieux, en effet, de la débâcle récente, certains spéculateurs,
                        entraînés par la hausse, avaient pris dee positions intenables pour leurs
                        faibles moyens. Aussi, quand la réaction est arrivée, ont-ils dû se retirer.
                        Un petit parti baissier fort bruyant s'est organisé et, profitant d'un oôté
                        de l'extrême resserve des acheteurs et de l'autre des réalisation» et de
                        l'incertitude du marché, il a réussi, an partie au moins, à casser Isa prix.
                        La valeur la plus éprouvée sous oa rapport a été la National Bank ; elle
                        avait aussi été la plus favorisée ; elle avait haussé de prés de 2 £ 1/2 en
                        deux jours.</p>
                    <p>On avait voulu marcher trop vite. Au fond, pourtant, la situation n'est pas
                        mauvaise, si l'on considere qu'il n'existe presque pas da position de fin du
                        mois, le petit publio ayant de ou réaliser ou se défaire avec perte.
                        L'avenii est donc asses not. Les détenteurs qui restée sont pour la plupart
                        dee capitalistes an état d&lt; soutenir le choc d'une forte baisse, sans
                        trop m laisser impressionner. 11 va sans dire que si les bourses de Paris et
                        de Londres sont fortement affectées, on en ressentira ici le contre-ooup, au
                        moins dans une certaine mesure. En tout cas, on espère, aussitôt le calme
                        rétabli, qu'une bonne reprise aura heu, ru l'abondanoe manifeste do capitaux
                        sur cotre place. Un fait symptomatique de cette richesse est l'expédition
                        faite en Europe samedi dernier par une banque locale de un million de livres
                        sterling ; il wt très rare, en effet, qu'en pareille saison on expédie du
                        numéraire à l'étranger ; c'est presque toujours le contraire qui a lieu.
                        ^</p>
                    <p>La National Bank a eu, on peut le dire, les honneurs de la semaine. Elle a
                        passé de 24 1/f i 26 1/2 pour retomber hier soir en cloture f 24 1346 La
                        Nouvelle Emission a suivi h même mouvement et clôturé ferme à 23 7/8, Le
                        chiffre des transactions a atteint plusieurs milliers de titras par
                        jour.</p>
                    <p>L'Agricole, qui était aussi ferme au début a 10 1/16, a atteint 10 13/16 pour
                        finir à 1( acheteurs, en assez bonne tendance.</p>
                    <p>De 14 1/2 la Delta Light tombe en clôtun à 14 3/16. La Deferred est à 16 SL
                        sans aflai-res.</p>

                    <p>de 360 — 365 nominal.</p>
                    <p>La Ramleh Railway débutai 8 7/16, fléchit i 8 1/8 et reprend a 8 1/4.</p>
                    <p>D'importantes affaires ont eu lieu en Sait &amp; Soda, mais le mouvement ne
                        se dessinera sur cette valeur qu'après l'assemblée du 27 courant En
                        attendant le cours suit les fluo--tuations générales ; il tombe (le 43 i
                        89/9, pour reprendre légèrement vers la fin à 40/3 ferme.</p>
                    <p>En Nungovich nous fléchissons do 10 1/8 i 9 9/16, pour remonter en clôture i
                        9 3/4. La rumeur d'une fusion a été officiellement démentie.</p>
                    <p>L'Anglo-American Nile recule de 5 5/16 à 5 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>La Crown Brewery u'a pas présenté une grande animation durant cette semaine
                        Le cours a fluctué de 216 i 220 pour clôturer</p>
                    <p>i 215.</p>
                    <p>De son côté, la Brassorie des Pyramides débuta i 126, monta i 130 et
                        réactionne i 128.</p>
                    <p>La Banque d'Athènes suit la baisse générale. Après avoir touché un moment 125
                        1/2, elle fléchit i 118 1/2 pour finir hier soir i 119 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Contrairement aux autres valeurs, les Baux du Caire gagnent du terrain :
                        après avoir fléchi un instant de 1,105 à 1,070, elles reprennent bientôt à
                        1,120 en clôture.</p>
                    <p>Les Eaux d'Alexandrie restant délaissées à 15 7/8.</p>
                    <p>Commo les Eaux du Caire, la'Khédivial Mail donne lieu à une bonne demande et
                        remonta de ce fait de 3 13/16 à 4 1/8 acheteurs. L'Ordinary hausse également
                        da 11 à 13 shelling.'.</p>
                    <p>Les Obligations Crédit Foncier réactionnent de 300 à 296 en clôture.</p>
                    <p>Los Markets fléchissent aussi de 23/9 à 23 vendeurs.</p>
                    <p>Une grande activité a régné sur Is Corpora tion of Wostern Egypt (Oasis). Le
                        prix a subi do violentas fluctuations ; de 1 3/4 il a haussé jusqu'à 2 7/16,
                        pour retomber aussitôt à 1 9/16 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>(Aujourd'hui, midi et demie).</p>
                    <p>Ce matin, sur d'importants rachats, les cours de certaines valeurs regagnent
                        en partie le ter rain perdu.</p>
                    <p>Ainsi la Banque Nationalo remonta de 24 3/4 à 25 1/2, l'Agricole de 10 à 10
                        1/2, laDaira de 21 3/4 à 22 1/16, la Nungovich die 9 3/4 à 9 13/16, la Delta
