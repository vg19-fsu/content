                    <head>OUR NATIONAL PROSPERITY.</head>
                    <p>The figures of our foreign trade for the year, and of our rrevenue for the
                        nine months ending on December 31 enable us to form some estimate of our
                        national prosperity. They are, says the "Spectator," sufficient remarkable
                        to startle even the most optimistic. </p>
                    <p>For the first time in our history the total volume of oar foreign trade
                        largely, exceeds the enormous figure of one thousand million sterling.
                        Imports have increased by 7.6 per -cent., exports by 13.9 per cent., and the
                        reexport trade by 9.5 per cent To give the figures : — The total value of
                        imports was £607,998,000, an increase of £42,968,000 over those of the
                        preceding-year ; exports reached £375,673,000, an increase of £45,856,000;
                        while re-exports were £85,163,000, an increase of £7,383,000. The details,
                        are as satisfactory as the totals. Among the imports, it is raw material and
                        articles mainly or wholly manufactured in which the chief increase lies, the
                        advance being over 12 per cent. Among the exports, the growing items are
                        largely articles wholly or mainly manufactured, the increase being 13.5 per
                        cent. To take one item, the increase in the export of iron and steel is 25
                        per cent in value and 26 per cent in quantity.</p>
                    <p>Nor has the first impression made by these Returns to be corrected by much
                        writing down on account of increased prices. It is true that the prices of
                        many articles and commodities were higher last year than the year before but
                        the general rise in prices is estimated at only 6 per cent, which leaves an
                        ample, margin for quantitative increase. Many conclusions may be drawn from
                        these figures, but one is insistent We are experiencing an unexampled ware
                        of prosperity. Free-trader and Tariff Reformer alike can make but the one
                        deduction. The increase in the imports of raw material and partially
                        manufactured goods, and in the export of wholly or partially manufactured
                        goods, shews that during the past year there has been a high pressure laid
                        upon our producing activity. The demand has forced an expansion of supply.
                        The Tariff Reformer may argue, as the "Times" does, that the dumping of iron
                        has ceased because America is too prosperous and is unable to supply her own
                        requirements, or that we are relieved of some Continental competition
                        because trade is so good with our neighbeurs.The "Spectator" prefers to put
                        it that a general wave of prosperity is passing over the world, and that our
                        existing economic system enables us to take full advantage of it.</p>
                    <p>The Revenue Returns for the last nine onths are equally comforting. The
                        increase over the corresponding period , in 1905 is £1,497,800. The
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer, having in view the lowering of the duty on tea
                        and the repeal of the duty jon coal, calculated to receive in 1906-7
                        £1,223.000 less than in. 190545. To take the separate items :— There wqs an
                        estimated decrease of £2,245,000 ip Customs. But up to date the decrease has
                        only been £674,000) and even if wo arsume that this item will decline during
                        the current quarter by another £700,000; the total decrease will still fall
                        far short of the estimate. Excise, estimated to decrease by £30,000, shows
                        for the nine months an increase of £107,000. The Death-duties were, assumed
                        t> grow by £230,000, but the actual growth during threo-querters of the
                        financial year has been £1,495,000. The increase in the Income-tax Returns
                        was patat £150,000 ; it is already £167,000 And in "miscellaneous items" an
                        estimated deficit oh the year of ,£13,000 haa been changed to an increase on
                        the nine months of £336,800. One or two items, such as stamps, show more
                        than their eitimated decrease, and-it looks as if the Post Office and
                        Telegraph receipts might fall short of their estimated increase. But these
                        are minor figures com paled with the great totals of incroase. Mr Asquith
                        can scarcely avoid having in hand at the end.of the financial year a balance
                        over his estimates of something between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000, and if he
                        succeeds in effecting certain savings in expenditure, as seems probable, he
                        may have a surplus of from £6,000,000 to £6,000.000 At present, of course,
                        the trade prosperity is not lully rejected in the Revenue Returns, except to
                        some small degree in Customs. But a prosperous commerce, high wages, and
                        continuous employment are bound very-soon to give a new elasticity to the
                        revenue and next year we may look to see its effects. It is true that the
                        enormous receipts from .Death-loties last year were rather in the bature of
                        a windfall, arid that millionaires cannot be expected to die with such
                        regularity and profusion in every financial year. The objection is fair, but
                        it must not be pressed too for. It seems to us that evegy Chancellor of the
                        Exchequer is justified in Hooking for much larger receipts from the
                        Death-duties during he coming decade than have accrued during he past The
                        great fortunes have been most f them made within the last thirty years, and
                        heir possessors are only just beginning to dirt Ve should not be surprised
                        to see the Death-utiea double their yield during the next wenty years.</p>

                    <head>EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Alured Bell write to the "Morning Post": Sir,- As your interesting
                        interview with Mr. Sidney Wellls the new Director-General of education in
                        Egypt, throws a good deal of light on one department of the British
                        administation, may I be permitted the opportunity of emphasising a few
                        points necessarily ignored io the impres-ionist opinion of a stranger to the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Tha national good wishes wi1l, accompany the ex Principal of the Battersen
                        Polytechnic in his mission for the advancement of the Egyptian youth in
                        technical education, but it is no disparagement to him to say that no new
                        mantle can overshadow the remarkable education regime instituted by Lord
                        Cromer in 1890, and conducted with conspicnous success by Mr. Donglas
                        Dunlop, the Inspector General of Egyptian Education. I remember the time
                        when, for instance, the proportion of pupils in tte Government schools
                        learning French and English was, respectively. 80 and 20 per cent.; it is
                        now, I believe. the other way round, namely, 15 and 85 per cent, in favour
                        ot tha English language. All the superior colleges of which Mr. Wells
                        speaks, such as the Schools of Agriculture, Law, Medicine, and Engineering,
                        have been founded under the "old" regime, and Lord Cromer has given
                        expression to his innate missionary genius in promoting the entirely
                        un-Mohamedan cult of female education by establishing schools for Egyptian
                        girls. The progress of the Egyptian youth in technical educaiton is, in my
                        humble opinion, of far less moment than their progress in morality, logic,
                        citizenship, and government, and the basis of these things has been well and
                        truly laid during the last sixteen years. As a proof of this I would advance
                        the improvement in the character of the Egyptian Government employees, the
                        great increase in the publishing and clientele of native newspapers, and the
                        really remarkable tendency in the higher social circles towards monogamy and
                        the disuse of female seclusion.</p>
                    <p>The influence of the Oxford and Cambridge graduates whom Mr. Dunlop has
                        gathered round him as professors in the schools cannot be overestimated-it
                        is as real and permanent an influence as that acknowledged of his own
                        masters by the English public school boy. In a word deep inroads have been
                        made in the Oriental habit-of thought; Western, even British, ideas have
                        been inculcated; and it is on this groundwork that Mr. Wells will construct
                        his superior technical edifice. Lest he should, in his enthusiasm, be too
                        anxious for immediate results, may I venture to remind him of the Arab
                        proberb, "Harry is the Devil, slowness is of God."</p>

                        and the Sultan according to British demands for his safety affordss striking

                        the Vali of Aidin are that his son, Rear-Admiral Said Pasha now in exile at

                    <head>THE RUSSIAN AGITATION.</head>
                    <p>YESTERDAY'S SCENES IN ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                    <p>To all outward appearance, Alexandria, ordinarily is peaceful on a Sunday,
                        seemed yesterday to be in the very throes of a revolution. The agitation in
                        favour of the release of three Russian refugees, who have been arrested by
                        the police on a very grave charge, and to which we referred on Saturday,
                        yesterday assumed much more serious proportions than were warranted by the
                        facts of the cave. Reedless of the diplomatic difficulties which stand in
                        the way of such a step, and regardless of the Capitulations, a large
                        proportion of the European population of Alexandria is clamouring for the
                        release of thrre Russian revolutionaries, whose extradition they wish to
                        prevent—on grounds which are purely sentimental. However much we may
                        sympathise with the Russian revolutionaries in their strnggle with
                        despotism, any movement such as the present is greatly to be deprecated, and
                        we are surprised to see that a local contemporary has gone to such extreme
                        lengths in fanning an agitation which can be prodcotive ol no good.</p>
                    <p>The scenes in the streets of Alexandria both on Saturday and yesterday were
                        deplorable.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, on a rumour being spread that the refugees had been embarked on
                        the Russian steamer for Odessa, a crowd of'manifestanta" nade their way to
                        the quay, shouting "Vive la liberty," and boarded the vessel with the object
                        of discovering whether the rumour was true. As it happened it was not, but
                        some ill-advised person in authority called out the Pire Brigade to deal
                        with the demonstrators. This measure only aggravated the situation, and gave
                        rise to incidents which might have been avoided by the exercise of more
                        discretion. The crowd attacked the Fire Brigade and did some damage to the
                        engine and hoses, while some horse play was indulged in. Order was only
                        restored by the arrival of H B. the Governor, who gave his personal
                        assurance that the prisoners were safe in custody, and that they would not
                        bo deported before a full enquiry was held into the case.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday something of the natnre of an attack was made on the Russian
                        Consulate in Ramleh-boulevard, ths consulate shield being torn down. A
                        cordon of police was afterwards formed round the consulate and traffic
                        stopped iu that part if the boalevard. The efforts ot the police to keep
                        people away from the vicinity of the building resulted in several scuffles,
                        but nothing of a very serious character happened, and after nightfall the
                        street returned its normal aspect, two sentries being left posted at the
                        consulate door. Several demonstrations took plsce in various parts if the
                        city daring the day, no'allly at the Bourse, where M Alfred Campos, as one
                        of the leaders of the agitation, connseled calm, wisely stating that their
                        object could not be attained by resort to force but by peaceful means.</p>
                    <p>Meantime the prisoners are incarcerated at Hadra prison, awaiting the
                        decision of the authorities. We believe that a solution of the dlfficulty
                        will be foundd in their being sent to one European port.</p>

                        cleverly and accurately handled by Sig Finizi Magrini. We will not deny,
                        however, that we feel, as it were, born out of due time for there intricate
                        cadences, which give one, like the longer trills in Handel's Messiah, no
                        definite pleasure, but rather a hauting terror that the strained performer
                        will break down, turning pathos into bathos. For the rest, Siz. Chotkowska

                        with such delightful entertainment and on such a lavish scale that everyone

                        their termination. Saturday's programme included the visit to the far famed
                        Tombs of the Kings for those who were energetically inclined, and a most
                        perfect lunch was served to those who preferred to spend their morning
                        exploring the various objects ot interest in the immediate

                    <p>During the afternoon the workmen and builders who had labored so
                        conscientiously at their task were collected in the still unfinished garden
                        at the back of the hotel and there received the reward of their toil in the

                        and handsome watches being presented to those who had control of the various
                        gangs. Mr. Harrison indeed proved the presiding spirit at these, as at the
                        subsequent proceedings, being generous in the thanks he accorded to those

                        his committee in its expression of hope for a successful future. Mr.
                        Harrison has assuredly done his best to make that future a certainty. The
                        dinner hour was fixed for 7.30 pm., and the restaurant, brilliantly lighted
                        and tastefully decorated, was soon filled with guests. A long T-shaped table
                        was surrounded by notabilities from Cairo and the neighbourhood and
                        representatives of the press. We have not space to give the names of those
                        who were present. Enough that the dinner was admirable, and the future
                        visitors of the hotel should have the utmost confidence in the cuisine.
                        Speeches, dancing, bridge, and conversation followed the dinner, and in the
                        course of the whole of our Egyptian experience we have never known an
                        evening in which hospitality and informality were so delightfully blended,
                        and we have no hesitation in saying that if the Winter Palace Hotel
                        continues as it has begun it will be the most popular house of entertaiment
                        in the length and breadth of Egypt. The only cause for regret during the
                        above-mentioned proceedings was the absence of M. Pagnon, who, as proprietor
                        of Pagnon's Hotels and latterly as managing director of the Upper Egypt
                        Hotels, has proved himself to be one of the leading and most successful
                        personalities in Egypt.</p>

                        <dateline>Luxor, January 18.</dateline>
                        <p>Luxor is awake! The town teems with tourists. Dahavashs are daily
                            arriving. The Luxor and Savoy Hotels are full, and the steamers of
                            Messra. Thos. Cook and Son and the Hamburg and Anglo-American Companies
                            line the river wharves, bearing their full complement of passengers, and
                            making the froont hum with life.</p>
                        <p>Before these lines are in print, another will be added to the list of
                            hostelries at this popular resort, and the "Winter Palace Hotel" will
                            have started on its career. The bookings for rooms are numerous, and the
                            manager looks forward confidently to a successful and a long continued
                            season.</p>
                        <p>The weather has been delightful. Even during the heat-wave that prevailed
                            further South a short time ago Luxor escaped it's intenisity, and now
                            the north wind has arrived, and, after a short break, the sun is once
                            more tempering its keenness, and warming the air as only Egyptian
                            sunshine in January can. It is well known to visitors who come to Luxor
                            again and again, that here is no climate of extremes. It is unusual to
                            have either intensely hot, or very cold weather, during the winter
                            season, and its situation is particularly sheltered from high winds.</p>
                        <p>Regular weekly Gymkhanas are now being held on the race-course just
                            outside the town. The third meeting of the season, on Thursday last, was
                            a most successful one. The usual native races were much appreciated by
                            the many strangers who filled the the grand-stand, while the three races
                            for visitors: gentlemen's donkey race, ladies' race, and goolsh-pegging
                            were well patronised and caused much amusement both for riders and
                            spectators. Baron Heintze, a well known visitor to Luxor, carried off
                            the 1st prize at the goolabs, and was also second in the donkey
                            race.</p>
                        <p>A very enjoyable entertainment was given on Thurdsay evening on board the
                            Rameses III., when some extremely clever tricks of cards and sleight
                            of-hand were shown by Sir Alfred Cooperm who is making the Nile trip
                            with his son. Some charming music was also provided, the singing of Miss
                            Reibold being a specially great treat to those privileged to hear her. A
                            collection was made at the end of the evening for the Luxor Hospital for
                            natives, which will no doubt benefit to a considerable exxtent by the
                            happy thought of those who organised the show.</p>
                        <p>Among the visitors now at the Luxor Hotel are Bishop and Mrs. Whitehead
                            of Madras, who are making a stay in Egypt on their way to India, and Sir
                            Benjamin Stone, M.P. for East Birmingham, and well-known as a traveller
                            and as a clever and enthusiastic photographer.</p>

                    <p>F.R.C.'s FIRST MEETING.</p>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>THe first meeting of the Fayoum Racing Club on their new course took place on
                        Friday, and proved an unqualified success, the attendance being extremely
                        large and some 42 horses entering for the five races on the programme. Amon
                        those present were the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and Lady
                        Vicotira Machell, Captain Proheroe Smisth and practically all the Englishmen
                        connected any way with the province; while of the native notables frew if
                        any were absent. </p>
                    <p>The club has erected two pulbic stands and a third class enclosure, besides a
                        private stand; stalls are provided for 30 houses and a parimutual and a
                        buffet are included.</p>
                    <p>Anybody in serach of a boy who can ride 5 stone would find a treasure in the
                        rider of the winner of the third and fourth races. Though conly a small
                        Sudannee boy of 10 years he rides with all the confidence of a crack light
                        weight at home, and with no little judgment. The following were the resutls
                        of the races:-</p>
                    <p>The Karoun Stakes value P.T. 800.</p>
                    <p>Abdul Wahed and Ahmed Fathi's Gazelle Mahomed Salah's Matrowie Mahomed
                        Basil's Assiury </p>
                    <p>13 started. Won easily by three length. The Club Stakes. value P.T. 600.
                        Abdul Washed and Ahmed Fatbi's Fritz Moward O'eilb's Kaahf</p>
                    <p>Shek Yesseen Abouel Mckaram's Tyar 6 ran. Fritz made practically all the
                        running and won in a canter by three lengths.</p>
                    <p>The Fayoum Stakes value P.T. 2500.</p>
                    <p>Mahomed el Basil's Fayoum 1</p>
                    <p>Mahomed Salah's Matrowie 2</p>
                    <p>Mahomed Abdul Hallaq's Farhan 3</p>
                    <p>5 ran. At the end of the first mile Matrowie seemed to have the race in hand,
                        catching up the leaders when akad without apparent effort, but entering the
                        straight Fayoum drew further away at every stride and won as he liked by 8
                        lengths.</p>
                    <p>The Pyramid Stakes value P.T. 1,000. </p>
                    <p>Mohamed Amin's Maurice 1</p>
                    <p>Moward Koleib's Ka-hf 2</p>
                    <p>Homamed Aly Byad's Kouisan </p>
                    <p>9 ran. a very hot pace soon produced a long tail with Kousan leading; in the
                        straight Kashf and Maurice both passed him, and maintaining his effort the
                        latter won a good race all out by a length and a half.</p>
                    <p>The fifth race somewhat failed in its object, it being intended for bona fide
                        fellaheen, with a special prize to the omdeh of the village from which the
                        winning horse came. Unfortunately I became known that the Moudir had
                        presented a gold watch for the winning omdeh, and though three horses were
                        sent back at the post out of the 15, the first three horses in the race
                        should also have been disqualified. Many difficulties occurred, but the
                        prizes were eventually awarded them.</p>
                    <p>The thank of the committee are especially due to Lady Victoria Machell for
                        kindly distributing the prizes, to the Moudir for his constant supervision
                        of the arrangements, and to Ahmed Eff Farhion whom most of the work has
                        fallen Mr. Miller kindly acted as starter, and Captain Prothero Smith as
                        judge.</p>

                            stagnant water. The native members of the Municipality, he says, do not
                            pay much attention to sanitary rules, and their European colleagues have
                            no time to see the city's welfare.</p>

                            <p>The American Admiral at the request of the British authorities has
                                landed marines. The streets are picketed with American guars. 600
                                bodies have now been recovered and more are constantly brought to

                                that this happened owiing to submarine changes in the channel.</p>
                            <p>(Later). Over 700 bodies have now been bnried. The American marines
                                are busy destroying dangerous buildings by dynamite. The inhabitants
                                are most grateful to the United States for her assistance. No
                                British vessels have arrived. There are 20,000 people homeless and
                                destitute. (Feuter)</p>

                            <p>The United States fleet leaving owing to a peremptory letter from the
                                Governor of the Island requesting their withdrawal, on the ground of
                                being fully able to attend to all the needs of the population.</p>
                            <p>He was only willing to permit a party of unarmed Americans to land to
                                protect the Consulate. Tbe American Admiral declared that the
                                immediate departure of the vessels was the only course confident
                                with the dignity of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The last accounts show that the death roll was under-estimated. In
                                addition to 700 bodies already buried, there are over 1000
                                un-identified dead still unburied, while the number of injured is
                                estimated at 3,000. of whom about 1,000 are seriously injured.

                            <p>Prince von'Bulow, departing from all precedent, delivered a regular
                                electioneering speech at a banquet at which he was entertained by a
                                political committee. The decision of German electors in favour of
                                international and social democracy, he said, would insure the
                                prestige of the Imperial Government and the peace of the German
                                people.</p>
                            <p>He regarded the events of the 12th December as the turning point in
                                the national life, because they witnessed the union of the
                                conservatives and liberals in defence of the colonies and setup a
                                precedent for dealing with other great national issues. It was
                                narrow egoism which induced the centrist and revolutionary members
                                to join the Socalists. The despotism and arrogance of the Socialist
                                leaders sought to choke all cooperation which would result in
                                positive reform. How 1ong, he said will this slavery of millions of

                            <p>Mr. Birrel speaking at Bristol, said that before many moths the
                                Government would resubmit education plans to the House of Lords to
                                enable the latter to reconsider their judgement. The Govern,emt must
                                also consider the problem too long postponed of dealing with the
                                Lords. We must have, he said, a Second Chamber which the country can

                    <p>Historical events have succeeded one another so rapidly the last few years in
                        Egypt that even the details ot the bombardment in Alexandria and the
                        misadventure of Arabi Pasa have passed away into the realms of ancient
                        history save to those who were personally interested in them. Scarce a dozen
                        pilgrims in as many years ever visit thus forgotten battlefield of Kassassin
                        and Tel el Kebir unless it be those who still mourn for their dead at rest
                        in the little cemetery in the vicinity. The mail train between Cairo and
                        Port Saidd screeches as it dashes past the deserted stations ; but so far
                        has Tel el. Kehi sunk back into the obscurity from which it emerged for that
                        short space of time in 1882 that it is difficult enongh to arrive there
                        unless one leaves Cairo at the early hour of 7 a.m., and the little journey
                        of some forty miles takes at least two hours to cover. The village itself
                        lies some distance away from the station on the further side of the
                        freshwater canal which has played so important a part in the history of the
                        century and the few cottages and native shops which have sprung up round the
                        station do not argue much for the prosperity of the place.</p>
                    <p>Within a five minutes' walk, alongside the railway track, surrounded by a
                        high fencing and embowered among its plantation of cypress, eucalyptus, and
                        palm trees, is the pathetic little cemetery where so many a young and
                        promising life was laid to its eternal rest. Wander through it now, and even
                        after twenty five long years, its gravestones will still touch some faint
                        chord of memory and stir the heart anew. Here Major Strong, of the R.M.L.I.
                        is buried, and here also is the grave of Colonel Beasley of the R.D.
                        Fasiliers. Lieut. J. A. Park and Lieut. G. McNeill, both of the 42nd Royal
                        Highlanders, sleep their long last sleep in close proximity; and the grave
                        of Lieut. L. Somerville is also nearby. Among the graves of the rank and
                        file are those of the Gordon Highlander, 4th Dragon Guardl 1st Life Guards,
                        4th Highlanders 1st Cameron Highalnder, 2nd Coldstream Guard, and King's
                        Royal Rifles; some with memorial tablets erected by their comrades, some
                        with individual head stone, some, also marked by the simple cross dedicated
                        to the "One Unknown." Muhamedans do not enter this little enclosure; and
                        though it has but few visitors of any sort, it shows signs of careful
                        tending which are grateful enough even to the casual Englishman who wanders
                        thus far from the beaten track, and should be doubly to those whose near and
                        dear ones lie there enshrined. </p>
                    <p>The battlefield where Arabi made his last stand lies some three miles away,
                        between the railway and canyon now levelled and turned into fertile soil
                        where the Egyptian Government is making offreating experiments. But for this
                        plants and the qalavated fields around it and the two hundred at the site,
                        the battlefield lies just as it was left after those eventful days of the
                        autumn ot '82. Walking around the hummocks of hard and stony desert which
                        border the railway, one can form a fairly good idea of that forced march
                        taken by our troops between the setting and up rising sun which so covered
                        them with glory at the time. Here can still be traced the lines of
                        earthwork- occupied by Arabi and his troop when he fell back from Kasassiu ;
                        here are the very embrasures of his guns just as they were aft when that
                        overpowering charge of British troops ruhei his positions, and drove the
                        rebel army back into the Delta. Mount this line of earthworks which still
                        meander round the position and imagine be scene for a moment. the 30,000
                        regular and irregular native troops safe as they thought in their
                        entrenchments; the first streaks of dawn just apperaing in the sky. Then the
                        sudden and unexpected approach of the British the first warning crack of an
                        Egyptian rifle and the the sudden cheer and rush of our men as they charged
                        across the field, Highlanders well to the fore. Imagine the pouring forth of
                        smoke and flame from the trenches, imagine the mees as the rebels were
                        pushed back and back into the second line of the earthworks and then finally
                        were scattered into the desert. The engagement was short sure and sharp and
                        decisive and that subsequent hurried march of the British troops acroos the
                        intervening country to Cairo broke the back of the rebellion. And even
                        though the details of the fight becaee lost in the mist of years, and
                        history books are but dull reading, it is gross for us to stand there on the
                        very spot and think of the days that are gone.</p>
                    <p>So fot a quarter of a century this battlefield has remained as it was left on
                        that event! day of September 13th, 1882, perhaps its very isolation the most
                        eloquent memorial of the engagement. Who knows but in this course of time
                        its site may be lost under the fields of vegetation which little by little
                        are lapping at its boundaries. For with the increasing prosperity of the
                        country and the spread of Cairo's suburbs, it is not at all improbable that
                        the wonderful climate of Tel-el-K ebir will build it another reputation in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>Certain it is that that this neighborhood was the Goshen of the Bible: here
                        Joseph dwelt with his family and flock; and here later on the Hebrews lived
                        out their dreadful bondage, building treasure cities and stone-houses for
                        their royal masters. Remains of these grain stories have been discovered
                        within recent years, and it supposed that the neighbouring ruins of Telle
                        Makhuts probably mark the site of the Biblical Pithoun. </p>
                    <p>But at the present there are but few signs of prosperity about the
                        surrounding county. Though every year sees more land under cultivation. Few
                        trains stop at the little station, andd the intending pilgrim must make up
                        his mind for an early start if he wishes to return by the train which leaves
                        Tel-el-Kebir at 4.15 p.m. And as there is absoultely no accommodation of
                        restaurant or the like, he must necessarily bear with him all he is likely
                        to require. But beyond these drawbacks and verily ther are scarcely
                        hardships if taken in the right way, a day spent in the glorious keen
                        dessert air on a spot rich with historical associations is of far more value
                        to mind and body than many passed amid the more vitiating surroundings of
                        town life.</p>

                    <p>" 'How pale and bloodless she looks' was the expression I often heard as I
                        passed through the streets," said Mrs. Annie Preston, who when interviewed
                        at 26, Wellington street, Stott Hill, Bradford, recalled the time of intense
                        suffering that darkened her existence yet to day Mrs. Preston is well, happy

                        Pink Pills.</p>
                    <p>"As a girl,: she said, "I was always-pale and delicate, so muchh so that when
                        in company I became quite ashamed of my deathly pallor</p>
                    <p>"But this was not my worst trouble. My eyes became sunken and glassy, my gums
                        white, and my tongue discoloured. Then I lost all vitality and strength; my
                        breath was short and painful.</p>
                    <p>Stabbing Pains of Indigestion</p>
                    <p>attacked me in the chest after every meal until eventually I dreaded the
                        sight or smell of food even such simple diet as bread and butter produced a
                        distressing fulness, followed by a lurking sensation.</p>
                    <p>"My head was racked with pains across my forehead, and my right grew dim;
                        many times during the day I felt a reeling sensation overcome me.</p>
                    <p>'My whole body became weak and languid and the slightest exertion excited
                        pain. My deep at night was broken, and in the morning I would rise feeling
                        dead tired and unfit for anythin. Breakfast was always left untouched except
                        perhaps a cup of tea.</p>
                    <p>'All interest in life disappeared, and anemia so ravaged my system that I

                    <p>Looked years older than I was.</p>
                    <p>My nerves became unstung, and my hands tumbled so violently that I could not
                        hold a tea cup.</p>
                    <p>"If I went upstairs I was attacked by cruel palpitation of the heart and loss

                        digested readily. Then I found my strength was being built up rapidly I
                        regained my height my origin spirits and lost my haggard appearauoe. I

                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purpose of acquiring and developing
                        land, industrial and other undertakings in Egypt, the Sudan and elsewhere,
                        including the securing of land concessions and the development of building
                        estates as set out in its Memoraudum ol Association.</p>
                    <p>The investment of money in Egyptian properties since the completion of the
                        International Agreements has led to very satisfactory results, and the
                        expansion and growth of industrial enterprise which has now set in, presents
                        most favorable opportunities for participating in the further impending
                        developments on very promising conditions.</p>
                    <p>The Board of Directors propose to direct their attention more particularly to
                        the purchase and development of building land and its division into plots
                        and: heir subsequent leasing or re-sale.</p>
                    <p>Amongst other remunerative methods of dealing with properties which may be
                        acquired is the erection of houses and other building. and the re-sale of
                        them on the installment system. As is well known, the demand for residential
                        premier in the principal towns of Egypt is far in excess of the supply, and
                        the Directors propose to take up business of the forgoing nature and
                        anticipate a considerable demand from Purchasers on the installment system
                        and otherwise.</p>
                    <p>The value of land in Egypt is shown by the sales which are taking place et
                        constantly enhanced prices, and it is believed that the Board of Directors
                        will be able to obtain, through their intimate local knowledge, exceptional
                        opportunities of securing properties which will greatly increase in value at
                        an early date, quite independent of the development works which may be
                        undertaken.</p>
                    <p>The Directors have already received several business propositions, which or
                        some of which they believe to be of a most favorable nature.</p>
                    <p>There, will come under their consideration after the first general allotment
                        of shares, and as negotiations will then have to be entered into, details
                        cannot now be given.</p>
                    <p>The Company has secured the services as Managing Director of Mr. Robert Scott
                        of Cairo, late Egyptian Manager of the Gresham Life Assurance Society, Ltd.,
                        together with the cooperation, on tie Board of Directors, of the other
                        gentlemen named, all of whom have resided in Egypt for a number of years and
                        who are well in touch with the class of business with which the Company will
                        deal.</p>
                    <p>The amount fixed by the Artioles of Association as the minimum subscription
                        on which the Directors may proceed to allotment is ten per cent of the share
                        offered for subscription.</p>
                    <p>The preliminary expenses are estimated at £ 3,500 (exclusive of the
                        underwriting comission).</p>
                    <p>Share Warrants to bearer will be issued if required, after the shares are

                    <p>En creant, il y a un an et demi environ, la societe Generale Egyptienne pour
                        l'Agriculture et le Commerce, le groupe promoteur de la Societe avait
                        specialement en vue le development des relations entre l'Egypte et la

                        Egypte a immediatement engage le conseil d'administration a concentrer une
                        grande partie de son activite surles operations de barque proprement dites,

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
