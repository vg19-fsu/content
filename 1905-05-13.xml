                                showing as they do for the first time that the whole scheme of
                                Imperial defence has been maturely weighed and de- termined upon by
                                the Supreme Council, which is superior to party. The view that the
                                invasion of Britain is impracticable is based on Lord Roberts's
                                opinion that a minimum of 70,000 invaders would be requisite for the
                                purpose. (Reuter.)</p>

                        <p>The relations between Greece and Egypt have always been very close ever
                            since the dawn of history, and the Greeks are now the one foreign
                            nationality which may be said to be really at home in the valley of the
                            Nile According to Mr. John Lambrides, a publicist well known in Athens,
                            who has just published a book on his travels up the Nile, two things
                            strike the observer, and they are the numerical superiority of the
                            Greeks over the other foreign races in Egypt, and the deep root which
                            they have taken in the coun try. The statistics are somewhat misleading
                            as they only take notice of Greeks of the kingdom, while those who come
                            from Turkey are reckoned as natives, since they belong to the Ottoman
                            Empire. Out of over a hundred and twelve thousand foreigners the Greeks
                            of the kingdom number no fewer than thirty eight thousand, but it all

                            included the total number of Greeks amounts, at a moderate computation
                            to one hundred and fifty thousand, or several thousand more than the
                            peoples of other foreign nationalities put together.</p>

                    <p>Mohamed Aly-square, as well as Cherif Pasha-street, at Alexandria to-day
                        bears a very bright aspect, nearly every inhabitant of the vicinity having
                        responded to the request of the Municipality to assist in the scheme of
                        decoration. The Venetian masts from which the thousands of electric bulbs
                        are festooned are gay with the Ottoman colours, and flags are flying from
                        every building.</p>
                    <p>A large dais has been erected opposite the sta- tue of Mohamed Aly, where the
                        official ceromo- ny will take place at 4 p.m. to-day. Over the entrance
                        there has been placed a large triumphal arch which will be illuminated in
                        the evening.</p>
                    <p>The illuminations this evening promise to be of a grandiose character. The
                        Municipality have evidently spared no expense to make the celebration worthy
                        of the occasion, and the Gas Company's electrical department have certainly
                        done their work well. Mohamed Aly- square to-night will be one blaze of
                        light, and it is expected that tout Alexandrie will be there to witness the
                        illuminations. It is to be hoped that the Alexandria police have taken
                        effectual measures to cope with any crush. One regulation is that carriages
                        will only be allowed to circulate in the square at a slow pace and in single
                        file, commencing from the entrance of Cherif Pasha-street down to the Cafe
                        d'Europe and from thence in the direction of Tewfik Pasha-street.</p>

                    <p>The following, is a resume of the answer received in April by the Alexandria
                        General Produce Association:—</p>
                    <p>Sowing has taken place as usual during March and April Although the generally
                        cool temperature and rather frequent showers were not very propitious to the
                        cultures, the young plants are showing a healthy appearance. Some
                        backwardness, however, may be remarked.</p>
                    <p>Resowing has been trifling in many localities rather frequent in other
                        quarters, but always partial only. In the average, it was not more important
                        than other years, and materially less than last season.</p>
                    <p>The acreage is considered to be almost the same as last season, showing only
                        a slight increase of newly cultivated lands. Mitafifi continues to occupy
                        the largest proportion whereas Abbassi and Joannovich have been slightly
                        reduced this season.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of some districts in the north of Behera and Gharbieh, the
                        water has been sufficient. With the amelioration and de- velopment of the
                        irrigation system, hopes are entertained that it will remain sufficient
                        during the summer months; although the level of the Nile is very low and
                        application of the rotation system has already commenced.</p>

                        same area as last year.</p>
                    <p>A further increase is reported from Upper Egypt, especially in the Beni-Souef
                        and Minieh provinces.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto Upper Egypt has been slowly exclusively Ashmouny cotton, but we are
                        in- formed that larger trials of Abbassi and some of Mitafifi will be made
                        this year.</p>
                    <p>Cultures are in good condition, but rather backward.</p>

                    <p>The announcement of the flotation of the Egyptian Improvements Corporation

                        attention to this new company, which has a strong local board. An important
                        detail, which should not be overlooked by the thoughtful investor, is that
                        there are no founders' shares nor any promoter's profits. The company is
                        being formed with a capital of £100,000, divided into 25,000 shares of £4
                        each, for the purpose of undertaking all property operations, and especially
                        the purchase and sale of lands situated in the cities and suburbs, and
                        improvement of land, building operations, loans on mortgage, etc. Several
                        important schemes are being studied. Half the capital is now offered for
                        public subscription at par. As already stated, there will be no Founders' or
                        Deferred shares or Debentures. The net profit, after deducting 10 % for the
                        board, will be wholly available for dividends. The first board consists of
                        Messrs. Alexandre Rustovitz Bey, George Nusgovich Bey, George Royle, Charles
                        J. Nicole, Maxime Charvaut, Anthony S. Constantinidi, and Demetrius K
                        Casdagli. The managing director will be M. Charles J. Nicole, of Messrs.
                        Nicole and Naef, Geneva, of which firm he is one of the heads, and which he
                        has managed since its foundation in 1881. The firm is one of the largest in
                        that city and is engaged in property operations.</p>

                    <p>At the last meeting of the Royal Numis- matic Society of London the president
                        of the society exhibited on behalf of Signor Dattari, of Cairo, a small
                        selection of Roman coins mostly of the Constantine period, from a hoard of
                        about 30,000 recently discovered in Egypt. These coins, before being
                        cleaned, seemed not to differ in any respect from what are usually known as
                        "third-brass" coins: but on being cleaned by means of a much dilluted bath
                        of nitric acid, they presented all the appearance of silver coins. The
                        blanks seem to have been silvered, or perhaps more probably tinned, before
                        they were placed between the dies. Signor Dattari suggests that this may
                        have been done as a precaution against forgery by coins cast in a mould in
                        imitation of the original.</p>

                    <p>The statement of accounts for the year 1904, which has just been issued,
                        shows that the cash balance in hand was on the 1st January, 1905, £180 12s
                        11d., as against £119 15s. 4d. last year; this includes, however, a special
                        donation of £40 given by the children and heirs of the late Shalom Tuby in
                        memory of their father. The amount subscribed by our community daring the
                        year has been £210 7s 6d., as against £219 18s 6d. last year. The
                        expenditure was under the following heads : Passages home, £41.7.7 ; cash,
                        £48.1.10 ; board and lodging and' food at Sailors' Home, Rudolph Asylum,
                        etc., £46.14.2 1/2-; hospital and funeral expen- ses, £73.6.7 ; assistance
                        to distressed Maltese, £41.5.6 ; ad venous to persons in distress on their
                        undertaking to repay the same, £26.2.0 ; clothing, £2.1.6 ; school fees,
                        £19.14.0 ; sun- dries, printing, postage, stationery, £5.17.8 ; total,
                        £204.9.10 1/2. The sum of £18 14s. Dd. was recovered from the Malta and
                        Indian Governments and £29 2s. 5 1/2 was refunded by private individuals to
                        whom temporary assistance had been given, making £4716s. 5 1/2d. The sum of
                        £62 6s. 3d., which had been expended on the relief of persons not belong-
                        ing to the Alexandria community, was also recovered from the Foreign Office.
                        Deducting these three sums (£110 2s. 8 1/2d,)from the total expenditure
                        leaves £194 7s. 2d. as having been spent on the relief of distressed persons
                        belonging to our own community. This is a much smaller sum than usual. The
                        greatest difference between this year and the average year is that the
                        number of persons for whom it has been necessary to provide passages home
                        has been less than usual. In 1903 the expense on this account amounted to
                        £185 19s. 10d., as against £41 7s. 7d. in 1904. On the other hand, hos-
                        pital expenses in 1904 have been £73 5s. 7d., as against £39 3s,8d. in 1903.
                        Financially, the not result ol the year's work has been that the Fund has
                        increased its cash balance somewhat, but the committee cannot hope that the
                        amount required for passages home will remain at so low a sum as sufficed
                        this year. It is not satisfactory to note that though the resident British
                        community rapidly increases the total amount subscribed to the fund shows a
                        ten- dency to decrease. As this fund takes the place of the poor rate it is
                        hoped that all British subjects will subscribe something according to their
                        means.</p>

                        <p>Captain Behan won the toss and the attack on Port Arthur was commenced by
                            Hopkins kicking off for the M.M.P. The latter pressed but Behan relieved
                            and Russell getting pos- session raced along the wing and centred
                            beautifully into goal, where Rafferty got the sphere at his toe and
                            scored for the greenshirts amid cheers. On retaining the M.M.P.'s got
                            away and Field gave Murray a hot one to save, which he did well. A
                            corner to the M.M.P.'s proved unproductive. The horse soldiers now
                            pressed, but Dunlop was displaying some of his old farm and his (Bob
                            Milne) rushes were well worth watching. Still not to be denied the
                            police broke away, and some misunderstanding between the Fusiliers'
                            defence let the M. M. P.'s score their first goal. The M. M. P.'s still
                            kept the pressure up and were awarded a corner. This was well cleared by
                            Supple, the ball finding touch. Play now was of a very even nature until
                            Russell broke away, but Davidson sent past. On the kick off the greens
                            pressed, but Dunbar sent into touch. Touch was now the order for some
                            time until Rafferty got away on his own, but he was robbed when in a
                            good position. Play was now confined to midfield for a small period. The
                            M. M. P.'s now got away in fine style, Hopkins doing some good work, but
                            score they could not as Behan was playing the game of his life. Play now
                            became fast, each team doing its utmost. A handball against the
                            Fusiliers helped to put them on the defence. Carter, however, sent past.
                            On resuming the greens pressed and Broadhurst had an anxious time of it.
                            However he cleared in good style and Goodman receiving the sphere, made
                            a dash towards Murray, only to find the latter well barricaded. The
                            Fusiliers were now having the best of a good game, and Russell getting
                            away on his own, sent a daisy into Broadhurst, who saved weakly and
                            Carey rushing in had no trouble whatever in putting the boys in green
                            ahead. Both teams were now playing a great game, the pace being a hot
                            one. The excitement was at, fever heat as Carter missed by inches. The
                            referree's whistle now announced half-time, the score standing</p>
                        <p>N. C. O.'s Service Companies Inniskillings 2 goals.</p>
                        <p>Military Mounted Police 1 goal.</p>
                        <p>SECOND HALF.</p>
                        <p>After the interval of five minutes both teams reappeared. Rafferty kicked
                            off for the Fusiliers. The M. M. P.'s at once took up the running and
                            Murray was called upon to handle, which he did well. Russell and
                            Davidson were now seen to advantage, the former making some good runs,
                            but the M. M. P.'s wore playing a steady game and retained the ball time
                            after time off side against Russell. Some good com- bination was now
                            shown by both sides. The centre forward of the M. M. P.'s was in good
                            form, and many runs were made by him, but over-eagerness spoiled all
                            chances. Behan, Supple, and Dunlop were conspicuous in re- pelling all
                            attacks. The M. M. P.'s now woke up and Carter got on a good run and
                            getting past Supple he passed to Hopkins, who with a splen- didly judged
                            shot sent up the equaliser amidst great cheers. This made both teams
                            play a lot better. A couple of hot scrimmages now took place around the
                            Fusiliers' goal until Dunlop got possession and racing the length of the
                            field passed to McLoughlin, who sent a magnifi- cent grounder with the
                            custodian, who in saving conceded a corner. This was well taken by
                            Russell, a scrimmage ensuing. Wingate, however, cleared and Hopkins
                            getting pos- session raced down the wing at a tremen- dous pace, but
                            this parting shot went wide (excitement was the order for some time).
                            Both teams were playing a very fast game, The greenshirts now got
                            a-going, Russell and Davidson being a terror to the M. M. P.'s defence.
                            Both sides were playing the one back game, the consequences being that
                            many players were given off side. Shortly after the referee's whistle
                            sounded full-time, the score reading:</p>
                        <p>N.C.O's Service Companies Inniskillings 2 goals.</p>
                        <p>Military Mounted Police 2 goals.</p>
