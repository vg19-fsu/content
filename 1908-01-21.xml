                        summer of 1903 that the Egyptian Guverndicat inued specifications suviting
                        tenders and designs for three roads. bridges to be constructed over the Nile
                        at Cairo. Por each bridge, thirty eight designs of tenders were received
                        from thirteen firma, six of whom were French, one each German, Belgian,
                        Italian, and Swiss, and three British, se of wbw submitted an American
                        design. It will be seen that the competition was interna cional, and excited
                        keen interest The Belgian torm alone submitted nine different designs for
                        the large bridge, and three for each of the call bridges. As many as sixty
                        to seventy drawings accompanied each tender, and in many cases general and
                        detailed perspective drawings were attached to them. It w ati cated that the

                        when so much was being written about the inability of British facturers to

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL RECEPTION INCIDENT <lb/>EXPULSION OF A SHEIKH</head>
                    <p>Considerable discussion has been aroused in native circles by the treatment
                        of Sheikh Razi, one of the ulema of the Al Azhar University at the last
                        reception held by H H the Khedive. It is averred that the learned Sheikh was
                        peremptorily ordered by the Grand Master of Ceremonies to quit the Palace
                        and that instructions were issued to the soldiers of the Khedivial guard and
                        to the police responsible for this gentleman's entrance to furbid bius
                        Admission in the future. However this may be, the Sheikh left Abdin in high
                        dudgeon and it can only be supported that the disfavour of His Highness was
                        the cause of his expulsion. Abbas II is unlikely to have ordered the
                        expulsion of an Alim from the Palace, above all on an occasion on which all
                        the Moslem world is en fête, without good reasons and the report that Sheikh
                        Razi had been guilty of proposing almost revolutionary measures dignified by
                        enemies of the ancient and celebrated Moslem: University with the title of
                        Schemes for reform'-which were highly displeasing to his fellow Ulems seems
                        to us to restore some solid foundation. In any case we may be assured that
                        H. H. the Khedive-who has in any case a perfect right to refuse to receive
                        persons in wbom be bas no confidence is too far above the tumult of party
                        strife and too inground in the pursuit not of his private but of the public
                        interest, to have instructed his Grand Master of the Ceremonies to take any
                        such action for merely personal reasons. At the same time we regret that no
                        measures were taken to warn Sheikh Razi before the neweption that his
                        presence at Abdin was not desired. for any such incident - which loses
                        nothing in the telling-is to be regretted, more especially when it occurs

                    <p>Dr. Rutherford, MP, left Cairo yesterday morning for Port Said in order to
                        return home in time for the opening of Parliament. When leaving be cordially
                        thanked his friends who came to the station to bid him farewell, for all the
                        attentions that had been shown to him and for the beautiful and costly
                        jewels sod treasures, which his admirers had bestowed upon him. He also
                        expressed his warm appreciation of the universal urbanity, with which he had
                        been received by the British officials and the facilities afforded him by
                        Dr. Dunlop sod his eminent Anglo-Boption colleges for pouring his
                        investigations into educational and other administrative mysteries. Mr.
                        Rotberford spent Sunday on a visit to Mansonnab. He was specially struck
                        with the ability and intelligence of Mustapha Pasha Maber, the popular
                        Moudir tberg, whose intellectual capacity and liberal sympathie deeply
                        impressed the Scotch Radical M.P. Here he noted, was at all events a B and
                        an Egyptian, who was ripe for self-government. Dr. Rutherford. M.P.,
                        reflected that conceivably there might be many others like him, scattered
                        throughout the length and breadth of the country, who had attained the same
                        high level of mental capacity. From sub examples be derived mueb
                        encouragement for bi pet theory that a larger share of Government and
                        responsibility should be conferred upon the Egyptian people. Accompanied by
                        the Moudit, the MP., visited the primary and technical schools, and made
                        detailed and exhaustive inspection of these educational establishments. He
                        also sawa girls sebool, which much pleased him. The want, however, of a
                        secondary school at Mar south was strongly commented upon by him. Dr.
                        Rutherford has been favourably impressed with all that he has seen, but his
                        visit, so far as could be gleaned, has not obliged his political a priori
                        intentions on the difficult theory of Egyptian Administration. He has made a
                        deep study of Egypt in books and reports and has digested the voluminous an
                        bual reports of Lord Cromer with amazing scrupulousness His fortnight's
                        visit to this country will therefore give him . panoply for entering the
                        arena of parliamentary debate fully primed to deal with every detail of
                        Egypt in Administration, which comes before the notice of the House of
                        Commons. He will be able to ask most searching questions about Egypt's
                        internal organisation and will ply Sir Edward Grey with crucial problems to
                        technical details of management and control Dr. Rutherford, M.P., is of
                        somewhat reserved character and does not unburthe himself to the
                        pertinacious interviewer However, as far as we can gather, the above

                        a glimpse into the ballroom later on would have been sufficient to convince
                        pessimists that there is plenty of life even now in Cairo. It was perhaps
                        the most festive function we have seen this winter, and we hear that some of

                    <p>To The EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE”</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,- A Cairo correspondent of the continental "Daily Mail," writing
                        from Cairo in December, calls attention to the continuance of financial
                        depression in Egypt and points out that the want of ready money is affecting
                        all classes and nationalities in the country and continues "The fall in
                        market values which met in last March has continued, land owners who sold
                        their cotton early in the year have been paid only in part while in the
                        share market securities which were quoted at £5 or £6 are now offered at
                        about £1. Complaint is made in European business circles that the Banks are
                        attempting nothing to relieve the situation. The Government is criticised
                        for its passive attitude......... "The crisis has touched the national
                        prosperity to a severe degree."</p>
                    <p>All the above is most certainly true, and unfortunately there appears to be
                        no prospect of affairs righting themselves as we anticipated in the new
                        year. Rents continue to stand at exorbitant figures, living becomes more
                        expensive daily, and money is as tight to-day as it was in the early days of
                        the crisis. The banks refuse to make advances now on the security of stock
                        to people whose signature would have been considered sufficient a year ago.
                        To put the whole thing in few words every man doubts the financial stability
                        of his neighbour with the result that a feeling of distrust prevails
                        throughout the whole business community of Cairo, and until money is forced
                        into circulation by some means or other there can be no prospect of renewed
                        prosperity. There are rumours of the Government being called upon to relieve
                        the situation by loan of two million to the country. It Is likely that the
                        Government will consider a pro position of this kind, and if it did would
                        the loan be of any real service to the country at large It would of course
                        tend to keep things going for the time being, but would it be of any
                        material assistance to the guarantee of financial security in the future. I
                        for one doubt fit, it might keep the heads of several of our too numerous
                        companies above water and it would certainly keep the rents at their present
                        exorbitant standard. Would this be an advantage! I think not </p>

                        and ducks tied tightly by the legs hawked about the streets for sale. How
                        long they are kept in this torture heaven alone knows, but the agony they
                        must endure is undeniable. This day in the Rue Cherif Parba I saw a native
                        offering for sale on 19 or 15 live wild ducks tied in benches by the lege
                        with cord sad slang over beholder Presumably some of these wretched bride

                        <p>A train from Milan to Rome crashed into the rear of a train proceeding to
                            Pavia at Acquabella bridge yesterday evening. The engine of the former
                            and the rear carriages of the latter were overturned. A third train from
                            Bergamo dashed into the wreck Up to the present 9 bodies have been
                            recovered. The Minister, Signor Carcang, and a number of Senators who
                            were passengers proceeding to attend the Nasi trial, escaped, uninjured

                    <p>"The Feast of Sacrifice," one of the great anniversaries of the Moslem year,
                        corresponding in importance to Christmas or the lowish Passover, was
                        celebrated last Tuesday with the picturesque ceremonial of the East at the
                        Holborn Restaurant, London, by Mohammedans resident in England. Followers of
                        the Prophet of every tint, from pale to darkest brown assembled at eleven
                        o'clock in the Kingsway Saloon, an oblong apartment dimly lighted by stained
                        glass windows. The floor had been carpeted with a number of white
                        table-cloths. Law students and basics men generally, the worshippers
                        represented almost all the races which have embraced the religion-Turks,
                        Indians, Persians, Ceyloupse, Arabs -- and, though in European dress, many
                        were adorned with the gorgeous flowing turban or the vari-coloured fer.
                        These were worn during the service; the Western top and round hats were
                        discarded and the worshippers, with one consent, removed their boots and
                        stood in stockinged feet. Many improvised turbans out of silk handkerchiefs.
                        The Feast of "sacrifice which the Islamic Society celebrates annually is
                        held in memory of the great pre-Islamio sacrifice of Ismael by Abraham,
                        which the Moslems believe in in preferen: ce to the Christian tradition of

                    <head>BUSINESS PROSPECTS IN THE SUDAN</head>
                    <p>II*<note place="bottom">*The previous article appeared on July 23</note></p>
                    <p>A correspondent writes as follows to the financial supplement of the Times In
                        my previous article I showed how the basinars development of the Saden is
                        támapered in all directions by the system of administration, and I will now
                        deal with the more important defects ol that system. </p>
                    <p>The chief and constant complaint of the Sudan Government officials is that
                        they are peatered and pampered incessantly by pile of petty account, which
                        always claim their prompt attention. The consequence is that their more
                        important work suffers, they have bnt little timo in offee hours oven to
                        bonsider 10 In fact all those who are most capable of forming opinions and
                        studying schemes for the development of the country's resources are scarily
                        ever permitted an opportunity to meet for the purpose of exchanging and to
                        cording their idees </p>
                    <p>A committo composed of the chiefs of various departments was appointed over a
                        year ago at Khartoum, and entitled the Central Economic Board, the object of
                        which was to advise the Government as regards all-nekured connected with the
                        general advancement of commerce and economic research. The idea was most
                        praiseworthy, and it should have received the full support of the Government
                        ; | but its nueces depends upon the determination of the committee to meet
                        frequently, and another weak point is the constitution of the Board. Its
                        members have been selected from among the most practical men in the service,
                        but they are all Government officials, with no special incentive to deviate
                        their leisure time to the work of the Board As the general advancement of
                        commerce isole of the avowed objects of the Board, it could do no harm if a
                        few of the local bankers and merchants were included in its constitution.
                        Possibly such men would be too young or inexperienced to express opinions of
                        great weight, but they could refer to their bead offices in Cairo or
                        Alexandria for advice, and they might even aet, under proper restrictions,
                        as mouth-pieces of such representative institutions as the General Produce
                        Association of Alexandria and the British Chamber of Commerce in Egypt
                        Questions concerning the advancement of commerce in the Badan have naturally
                        great interest for these institutions, which possess special facilities for
                        obtaining the opinions of experienced merebants and financiers, and they
                        have usually been found willing to respond to invitations from official
                        quarters for reports on matters of general interest: In this way much
                        valuable information could be given to the men who have been appointed to
                        advise the Government, and who, admittedly, have little if any practical
                        experience connected with commercial matters. But it is essential that the
                        Board should hold meetings regularly at short intervals, and that the cause
                        of their inability to do so bitberto should be removed. </p>
                    <p>OFFICIALS AND ACCOUNTS. </p>
                    <p>This brings me to the root of most of the administrative troubles of the
                        Governmentnamely, the need of an adequate yet simple system of accounts. It
                        is really a question of the first importance, because not only does the
                        effective use of every department depend upon it, but it is the chief factor
                        to be considered in regard to the proper development of the country, and for
                        the following rea-ons : </p>
                    <p>The most efficient and valuable men in the State service are compelled, to
                        sorrow, to sacrifice the greater portion of their time to the deaseless and
                        seemingly futile demands of the Accounts Department. The responsibility of
                        disbursing petty cash in most commercial houses is usually entrusted to a
                        junior clerk under reasonable control, for the simple reason that it is
                        economically unsound to occupy the time of senior men with petty detail of
                        any kind. In the Sudan Government service no item of expenditure is too
                        small to evade the ordeal of being recorded on several official forms, which
                        are checked and counterchecked and sigued by various clerks until they are
                        approved and signed by the chief clerk. Then they all have to be sanctioned
                        and approved, signed and countersigned, by the head of the department before
                        being sent in to the Finan: cial Department offices, where they are again
                        checked and counterchecked, signed and countersigned, by many employdi, and
                        whence they often return for correction or adjustment All such corrections
                        and adjustments have to be submitted to the same laborious series of
                        operations, and as they are too often made the subject of much needless
                        correspondence, the burden of this process is thereby increased to s very
                        serious degree. Noofficial can get as moob As a bottle of ink or even a
                        postage stamp for his office without signing soveral of such applica tions,
                        official returns, and other forms, all of which bave to be filled in with
                        scrupulous exactitude by his clerks, when at headquarters, or by himself
                        when on tour in the provinces! If he has, say, five subordinates employed in
                        the provinces on public works, garvey, educational, or other duties, the
                        preparation of such doopments increases tenfold, and one stands appalled at
                        this colossal waste of time. </p>
                    <p>It seems almost incredible that an official who is entrusted with the
                        administration of the affairs of a whole province is not allowed the
                        financial responsibility of a junior clerk in a counting house. Yet such is
                        the melan. choly fact, and, as a consequence, I have often seen the busiest
                        officials engaged for many hours in merely attaching their signatures to
                        heaps of documents which they could not possibly examine and great
                        proportion of which related to nothing more important than the sending of a
                        threepenny telegram of the <cb n="4"/> engaging of a camel driver. And it
                        must not be sappoord that they have seen the last of those official "terms"
                        and "retams," distinguished by various titles and numbers, after being sent
                        to the Financial Department On the contrary, they emerge in course of time
                        to be despatched to the Accounts Department in Cairo, where they are once
                        more checked and counter checked, signed and counter-signed by another staff
                        of officials who apportion the various items of expenditure to their
                        respective positions in the State accounts. They are then returned to their
                        authors for further signatures and reports; bat as it would be too
                        monotonous to follow them to their final resting place we will now leave
                        these exasperating documents. </p>
                    <p>MULTIPLICATION OF CORRESPONDENCE </p>
                    <p>In 1902, Colonel Drage, the Controller of the Revenue Department, reported
                        that the expenditure on stationery by the Sudan Government in the preceding
                        year was L E 600 in excess of the estimates, and he remarked that "nothing
                        londa itself more to wasto and extravagant use than stationery.". Thereupon
                        Lord Cromer draw attention to the matter in the following observation :-"I
                        venture to express a hope that a steady check will be kept con excessive
                        centralization, and the Sodan is pre eminently a country where the
                        administration should be decentralized 88 much as possible." </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer has frequently alluded to the tendency which exists among
                        officials in Egypt to multiply correspondence utbedersarily, and it may not
                        be out of place to mention a typical instance of this abuse which he cited
                        in his last report (Egypt, No 1, 1907) It consisted of an official file of
                        81 typewritten pages relating to the case of a certain wise man who had
                        boeght from his nephew half of a donkey for a sum rather less than £2. A
                        doubt arose as to whether the donkey had been bought or stolen; and on this
                        subject 73 official notes were record ed by various officials residing at
                        Caito or el sewhere. The question of the ownership of the donkey bad been
                        under discussion for one year and nine months, yet in November last it was
                        apparently still unsettled. In ady other sphere of life such lamentablo
                        waste of time and energy would have been avoided by paying somebo dy the £2
                        or shooting the donkey. </p>
                    <p>One oan sympathise with the feelings of Colonel Stewart, a remarkably able
                        officer, when he wrote his report on the Sudan in 1882, the last official
                        report insued before the Mahdist oecupation Egypt, No. 11, 1883). In this
                        report be made soine suggestions for the future go yerument of the country
                        from which I may te peat the two following ones, namely: - </p>
                    <p>A department for the Sudan frances to be attached to the Ministry of fiuanoe
                        ait Oairo, This departmeot should be more of an auditing office, and should
                        not interfere with the executive finance office at Khartum. </p>
                    <p>A qualified official to be sent to the Sudan to reorganize the system of
                        publio offices and introduce a national mode of bookkeeping. At present it
                        is impossible for any outsider to un derstand the system of accounts, and
                        the num ber of choclos and counter obecks 80 seriously increase business
                        that notwithstanding the present enormous staff, extra olerks have
                        frequently to be called in. </p>
                    <p>The first of the two suggestions was eventually adopted; but the department
                        which is still retained in Cairo bas attain noch dimen wions as woro
                        prabably never contemplated by its promoter. Its maintenance was doubtles
                        considered necessary so long as the Sudan was administered as a province of
                        Egypt but under the new wiginis ita practical ability has, to all intents
                        and purposes, disappeared, and therefore it might vary well be abandoued and
                        transfer rol in a modified form to the rest of the Go. vernment at Khartum.
                        The effect of such a mi) ve would be to sconomize the vast amount of time
                        and labour which is expendel at present in corresponding, upon such a
                        complicated subjostas scouts, with a department situated so di tagt from the
                        headquarters of all ober branches of the service I might here romark that a
                        further domy should be made at the samo timo by closing the office which was
                        open od in Alexandrie some years ago to attend to the clearing and despatch
                        of material destined for the Sudan railwaya. It is still maintained at
                        considerable expense, although its existence is op longer justified since
                        the opening of Port Sudan.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the second of Colonel Stewart's suggestions which I have quoted,
                        the first por ton, involving the reorganization of the system of public
                        officials, asight very well be relerred to the Central Boonomie Board for
                        examination. The ergonoy of this question is clearly rebog nized and frankly
                        admitted by almost all the State officials, and if amplo Assistance is pro
                        vided for its investigation, I have 09 doubt that the Board will soon be
                        able to propose s practical solation</p>
                    <p>INFERIORITY OF EMPLOYEES </p>
                    <p>The bottor class of Bayptian olerks will not as a rule, go to the Sudan, and
                        I think that the Sudan will ultimately find reason to con gratulate itself
                        over their disinclination to go there, for they are not appreciated in Egypt
                        by any English banker or morebant. lo the meantime, however, the progress of
                        adminis. trative schemen is seriously impeded in every direotion by employke
                        of a very inferior order who are generally incompetent and lazy, who often
                        go siok on the sligbtgat pratast, and, to som up, who are very dar indoed at
                        the price of their wagos.</p>
                    <p>What is the remedy 1 It is to employ English clerks There are thousands of
                        young English alerks, between 30 and 30 years of age, available in England
                        today, bodily and mo Tally sound,, healthy and active intelligent honest,
                        and fairly well educated, who wonta eagerly apply for enployment in the
                        Sudan Government service under fair conditions of openeration and leave. A
                        man of this kind Would, sooppt, Na matter of couns the to ponsibilities
                        which all Egyptian employ Whirtel <cb n="5"/> absolutely. He should be able,
                        if required, to take down in shorthand ble bhios instructions as quickly as
                        he could atter them, and type write them in rather less time, thus saving
                        him the labour of three quarters of his corrrespondence. He could perform
                        the duties of his post in the conscientious manner which is so familiar to
                        us in England, but so sadly lack: Ling 18" &amp; Levantine and many Oriental
                        18-1 tions, and after 12 months service he ought to be capable of relieving
                        his chief of at least I the bulk of the detail work which at present clogs
                        his brain and hampers every effort to improve and extend the efficiency and
                        use fulness of his department. </p>
                    <p>I have not attempted to describe what might be regarded as a paragon of
                        virtue by officials unacquainted with the working of a well-equip. ped
                        comercial office in London I have merely mentioned the usual qualifications
                        which English clerks are now required to pos-1 sess in order to obtain good
                        employment in London business houses. </p>
                    <p>The principal objections which have been raised by Sudan Government officials
                        to the suggested employment of English clerks are that suitable quarters
                        could not be found for them in Khartoum, and that their salaries would be
                        expensive. I do not consider that either of these objentions présents any
                        serious difficolty. The average Englishman is moreindependent and capable of
                        fending for himself abroad than any other nation's occasional
                        representative, and if a demand were to arise for fairly cheap and
                        comfortable lodgings in in Khartouun, I have no doubt whatever that the
                        supply would soon be forthcoming. Young | men wBo owigrate to the Colonies,
                        for example, do not ask or expect to be surrounded by un accustomed
                        laxuries, or even to meet with the standard of home comforts which has been
                        faniliar to them from boy hood. </p>
                    <p>As regards the expense, it would be no exaggeration to state that three
                        English clerks could easily do, the work which in the Soudan is at present
                        alloted to ten incompetent men, and that the aggregate day of these ten men
                        would provide adequate salaries for their three English substitutes ahd
                        still leave a consider able surplus. </p>
                    <p>Before leaving this subject I venture to add a suggestion that no bard-and
                        fast lines should be drawn in regard to the scale of pay for the English
                        clerks I have been recommending Rules are made to be stretched--at the right
                        mothent; and there is nothing which has such a deadening influence on human
                        initiative and the exercise of individual ability as the know ledge that you
                        are receiving the marimum pay allowed to men of your rank, and that you
                        cannot hope for promotion to higher ranks Therefore I believe that the Sudan
                        Government would be wise in arranging that these men, after a reasonable
                        term of service, might be recommended for higher rates of pay according to
                        individual merit. It is a very young Government, and it has got to create a
                        Civil Service; it is not fettered with the old-fashioned traditions and
                        shibboleths of old-Governments, and therefore, it can afford to be
                        unconventional. It is poor économy to engage men of high professional
                        attainment for the purpose of developing new departments of State without
                        providing them with intelligent subordinates, because under such conditions
                        their abilities are Wasted upon trifles, and their energy is Kable, in such
                        a climate, to flag before they are free to deal with more important matters </p>
                    <p>The latter portion of Colonel Stewart's second suggestion relates to the
                        introduction of &amp; rational mode of bookkeeping, and I think I have
                        already said enough to show that his opinion in this respect was not
                        followed </p>
                    <p>THE GOVERNMENT'S Accounts. </p>
                    <p>It takes five months to prepare and publish the annual statement of seconots
                        of the Sudan Government, and this fact alone would seem to indicate the
                        existence of some serious defect in their system of bookkeeping. The annual
                        state: mont shows the receipts and expenditure of the various provinces and
                        departments, also the situation of the reserve fund ; but no provision is
                        apparently made for capital account and no assets are shown. I am not
                        qualified to speak with each weight on this complex subject, but I think I
                        may venture to suggest that the railways, stearns and boats, agriculture and
                        lands and certain other departments might be allowed, with advantage, to
                        have their resp80-1 tive capital accounts. </p>
                    <p>As regards assets, I may point out that in Khartum alone the Government
                        possess several square miles of the best building sites ou the river front
                        and in other positions, and as the present marketable price of adjoining
                        plots may be taken as 20s. the square metru at a modetate estimate, it seems
                        clear that this land represents a State asset of considerable value. lo
                        Khartum North, on the opposite bank of the Nile, the Governtient occupy all
                        the land except one plot far distant from the railway! terminus. Sooner or
                        later they will have to abandon their barracks, workshops, and storeyards
                        there and make way for commerce Most, if not the whole of Omdurman belongs
                        to the State, and in Port Sudan there is but one landlord, for the
                        Government own the entire foreshore, and everything beyond it. </p>
                    <p>These various properties will increase in value rapidly when com nercial men
                        are encouraged to enter the country, and even bow they could be partially
                        used withont moob difficulty as a means of aaising loads, and thereby
                        releasing the Budan from its dependenca opon the annual contrib tion from
                        the Egyptian Treasury Among other "assets we may surely include the railway
                        rolling stock and plant, as also the steamers and boats</p>
                    <p>In such matters, however, it is essential to have expert opinion. Just as we
                        consult doctors, lawyers, or engineers for professional advice in matters
                        connected vith their respective spheres, so we should call in the chartered
                        accountant to revise our system of accounts. Tho evils of a complicated
                        system are so pro<cb n="6"/>nounced and so generally recognized nowadays
                        that they are no longer tolerated by important business concerns. Most
                        limited liability companies are compelled by the force of public opinion to
                        have their accounts organized and audited by chartered accountants, and
                        there is no lack of evidence to prove that the economies effected in time
                        and laboor by their assistance have been most highly appreciated in
                        commercial circles.</p>
                    <p>It is absolutely necessary that the reorganization of the present system of
                        accounts abould be carried out by a professional Accountant, as he would
                        enter upon his duties with an open mind, and his position would naturally be
                        quite independent. There are many excellent firms of chartered accountants
                        in London who could deal with the work efficiently and rapidly, and it will
                        be a great pity if it is not commenced very soon. The Sudan Administration
                        is only about seven years old, and therefore its accounts can be overhauled
                        without an abnormal amount of difficulty, but if the work is postponed the
                        present system will soon become perfectly unwieldy, and the cost of
                        reorganization will then be very heavy.</p>

                    <dateline>London, January 11th </dateline>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion of the Green Howards.is getting ready at Aldershot for
                        their Egyptian tour of service As already intimated, it will embark on the
                        16th-inst for Alexandria, at Southampton on board the troopship Soudan and
                        will reach Alexandria on the Inst day of the month, yia Gibraltar, Malta,
                        and Limasol The battalion' has just been clothed throughout with tropical
                        wear, including three suits of khaki drill, and the new.colonial pattern
                        serge, faced with the historio green of the corps. The battaliou will have
                        an embarking strength of some 850, of all ranks under the command of
                        Lieutenant Colonel E. MB-on, and Major C. A. C. King second in command.
                        Aghiolast inspection, the other day, General Herriker Major paid a high
                        compliment to the efficiency, drill süd disciplino, of the Green Howards,
                        particularly referring to the non-commissioned officers, and wishing all
                        ranks every success in their coming tour.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieutenant E. D. H. Tollemache, 3rd Battalion Coldstreara Guards,
                        Cairo, has been promoted lieutenant after two and a half years' service in

                        Howard to Alexandria This does not look like immediato dissolution on part
                        of the battalion: There is a shrewd suspicion that Mr. Haldane is pretty
                        well sick of his reductions for the sake of "economy with efficiener"
                        Gallant little Wales, which supported him warmly until he has ordered
                        several battalions of Militia and Volunteers to be disbanded, is now going
                        for him in a whole hearted manner.</p>

                        with the incident referred to above</p>

                    <p>BODY BLOATED WITH DROPSY.</p>
                    <p>Mrs W. Brown, 8 South-Western Cottages, Dorchester, England, says : "For
                        fifteen years I suffered with my kidneys It started with a confinement and
                        everyx confine mont aftorwards left me worse than before. My back gave me
                        the most trouble; across the small part of it was a dreadful feeling, just
                        as if a knife were being put into my back, the pain taking my breath away. I
                        did not know how to turn over in bed or how to get up in the mornings, for
                        there was always a gnawing ache in my back, and the least cold would settle
                        there.</p>
                    <p>*The urinary secretions were in a dread, ful condition. They caused awful
                        pain, and sometimes I was unable to pass them. 1] became very much bluated
                        in the body, legs and face, and there were bage 4 of 1 water under my eyes,
                        making them very.. tender. I was unable to fasten up my clothes properly,
                        because of the swellings.</p>
                    <p>"I decided to try Doan's Backache Kid ney Pills and noticedoliongoon after
                        began using them, the flrst benefit being that I awoke feeling free of pain,
                        and with an appetite. Keeping on with the pills the paids grew less
                        frequent, I felt bettor in myself, and the kidney secretions became clear
                        and natural. Now I am feeling abgolutely well – it is the first spell of
                        good health I have had for fifteen years. My cure is all the more wonderful
                        because my complaint is inherited, being a family-one.</p>

                    <p>Il n'y a pas grand'chose de changé dans la situation d'hier, sinon qu'il y a
                        peut-être en certain ralentissement dans les transactions. Mais les prix
                        sont soutenus en général et quel ques titres gagnent même me ayance apprécia
                        ble. La baisse nouvelle du taux privé d'escompte à 4% ainsi que la
                        remarquable fermete des va leurs égyptiennes au Stock Exchange ont
                        naturellemgat contribué notre soqtien local. La seule réserve à faire, comme
                        nous le disions hier, est que jusqu'à présent les paquets n'ayant pas
                        effectivement changé de mains une réaction est toujours à craindre au cas o
                        les évé. nements prendraient une autre tournure.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les titres da faveur il nous faut signa ler la National Bank qui
                        progroase de 20 7/8 # 21 1/16, la "Delta Light de 91/2 = 99/16 ot. la Dalra
                        do 18 7/16 a 18 11/16. Les Obligations Crédit Foncier, a cause d'une demande
                        qui n'a pu être satisfaite, a passé de 2-7 à 298 l'ancienne et de 256 à 958
                        la nouvelle. En syance également l'Alexandria Water de 10 1/4 A 10 5/46, les
                        Nangovich Hotels de 13 &amp; 13 1/4 et le Banco di Roma de 107 à 108..</p>
                    <p>Dans lo poupe des valeurs de moindre im. portanoe, la Cassa di Sconto moute
                        de 52 A 52 1/2, les Estates de 11/82 à 3,8 et les Building Lands, après être
                        restées longtemps délaissées aux environs de 1 livre, 'se relèvent à 1 3/8,
                        en hausse de 1/8 sur le prix d'hier. 1 Malboureusement la reprise n'est pas
                        générale et plusieurs titres qui avaient joui d'une certaine vogue ces temps
                        pamor pubis sent one dépression plus ou moins marquée. La deferred Doltar
                        revient de -5 1.8 5, la Delta Land de 1 5/32 4 118, l'ordinary Khedivial
                        Mail de 19/- á 18/6, le Comptoir de 2 5/16 à 2 9/32, l'Aboukir de 34 - à 33
                        3, et l'action Land Allotment de 1 15.16 à 178. Mais la baisse la plas
                        sensible est celle de la Nile Land de 78/4 a 7 1/4. Il faut dire pour cette
                        dernière que les prix sont plutôt nominaux, les transations sur de titre
                        étant clairsemées et pres. que nulles.</p>
                    <p>Les Rita et l'United, qui s'étaient réveillés ces jours-ci, sont également
                        retombés momentanément dans l'oubli, délaissés aux prix respectifs de 3,8 et
                        1/4.</p>
                    <p>Il n'y a pas d'autre changement signaler, que l'inscription de la Ramleh à 4
                        3/16 ex, coupon contre 4 7/16 hier. La différence repré. sente le coupon
                        distribué.</p>
                    <p>Comme on lo' voit, - la tendance est inégale Pour quelques valeurs favorisées
                        par les mar. chés européens ou poussées par la spéculation locale il y a
                        nouvelle avance, tandis que pour d'autres moins importautes et moins nom
                        breuses aussi, o'est la faiblesse et la lourdear qui prévalent. Dans
                        l'ensemble, cependant, si les affaires se sont quelque peu marétées, on peat
                        considérer la cote comme soutenue et la tondanoe générale comme
                        favorable.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
