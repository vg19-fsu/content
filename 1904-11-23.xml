                    <head>THE CAMPAIGN..</head>
                    <p>A dead calm appears to prevail for the time being in Manchuria, and a
                        telegram from Mukden to-day states that owing to the strength of the
                        respective positions, neither army ap pears inclined to attack, unless
                        possessing such a preponderance in numbers that they are able to make a
                        flanking movement. It will be useful during the present lull in the campaign
                        to study the climatic conditions which must exercise a very large influence
                        upon the course of the war. In Manchuria the climate oscillates between two
                        extremes. In winter the cold experienced is very severe, while in summer the
                        sun shines like a burning copper dise, and the thermometer rises to dearly
                        one hundred degrees <cb n="6"/>

                        sero, or eighty-one degrees of frost, is the lowest aqtually recorded in
                        Manchuria. Generally, speaking, in the south the average winter minimum is
                        not much below zero Fahrenheit. But what the armies have chiefly to fear is
                        the north wind, which is the terror of Manchi When it blows no cover ing of
                        furs is sufficient to keep out the piercing cold, and life in the open will
                        be almost unbearable, especially, for men doomed to outpost and sentry work
                        at night. Fortunately, this awful wind rarely lasts three days; and in its
                        absence the winter sun shines 80 brightly that the dry cold is not felt.
                        When once the country becomes ice-bound and the rivers and streams are
                        frozen over, the tactics and even the strategy of the opposing armies will
                        be greatly affected. The side adopting the defensive will find that the
                        rivers have completely disappeared as a calculable factor, and can no longer
                        be reckoned upon as useful tactical obstacles to the passage of an
                        assailant. The lies, therefore, of the Tai-tae, the Sha bo, and the Hun will
                        shortly disappear from the nomenclature of the campaign as the special
                        localities of great struggles. It is a complete transformation of the
                        conditions of warfare, which will bestow a unique interest upon this
                        campaign, already so fruitful in sur prises. Another thing we may look for
                        is a great increase in mobility. As soon as the country roads and tracks
                        have been worn down they acquire the smoothness almost of an asphalt roadway
                        in Alexandria. With the new possibility of moving in all directions without
                        let or hindrance, the scope of the cavalry arm will be greatly enlarged.
                        Accordingly, until April and May next we may be on the lookout for many new
                        features in the winter struggle strugglo between the rival armies.</p>

                    <head>CRETE AND GREECE.</head>
                    <p>A telegram from London this morning an nounces that Prince George has made
                        another attempt to force the hands of the Powers in regard to Crete. No one
                        acquainted with. Cretan politics can doubt that the union to Greece is bound
                        to come sooner or later; but the moment of its consummation must depend on
                        the goodwill of the four Powers. Turkey would hardly do more than formally
                        protest, for she has practically lost all hold over the island, which has no
                        Turkish garrison, such as the soldiers who represent the Ottoman Suze rainty
                        over Samos. It is thought that France and Russia would not be favourable to
                        union in the near future; the relations between-Italy and Greece are not
                        particularly good, the: Italians and the Greeks are rivals in Epirus, and
                        the compulsory recall of the Italian Minister from Athens last spring did
                        not improve the feelings of the two races: Great Britain has no special
                        interest, in hindering, or in hastening, the union, except that, when once
                        the Greeks have Crete, they will demand-Cyprus, which is always regarded by
                        them as an Hellenic island. The most formidable argument in favour of the
                        union is that no one desires a fresh disturbance in Crete this winter, which
                        would certainly call for the intervention of the Powers Few will be so
                        singuine as to pretend that the Cretans will find amalgama tion with the
                        Greek Kingdom a complete success, nor will the Athenian politicians have an
                        easy task in governing the warlike popula tion of the island. Besides,
                        certain Balkan States will almost certainly pat forward claiek for
                        compensation, as Greece herself did when Hastern Roumelia was united to
                        North Bul garia in 1883. Meanwhile, we cannot shut our, eyes to the fact
                        that the Cretan question has been once more reopened, and that at a time
                        when Europe has many preoccupations elsewhere.</p>

                            Paris. Their suspicions being aroused, they sent Messrs. Yarrow
                            instructions to retain the boat. It was, however, too late to do this,
                            as the destroyer had left the Thames. It eventually reached Libnu, and

                        is in the neighbourhood of the Daedalus lighthouse, to the north-east of
                        Berenice. The reefs run out there in every direction and yet one cannot
                        touch bottom in 300 fathome with deep ses lead. The Japanese could place two
                        torpedo-bosts there, one on the east and one on the west of the channel, and
                        they could knock the Russians into a cocked hat at this point.</p>

                        intention of blowing up that portion of the Baltic Boet which will go
                        through the canal. The Russian admiral has cabled to the consulate here to
                        arrange about supplies. Four steamers of the Volunteer fleet which are said
                        to be flying the commercial flag are expected hourly at Port Said. Their

                    <p>On the 10th ult. a patrol left El Obeid for Rahad, under the command of
                        Miralai O'Con- nell Bey, to proceed against Abou Zeids of Kitrs, who had
                        expelled the Mek appointed by the Moudir of Kordofan last April and asurped
                        his authority.</p>
                    <p>The force arrived at Gebel Daier on October 12, when Abou Zeida was ordered
                        to come in by the 13th. He refused, and on the 14th the axpedition advanced,
                        capturing the village and some hills. Meantime, the Meks of Feria and Kemla
                        joined Abou Zeids and desultory firing continued till the 18th, when the
                        Camel Corps and artillery captured the two villages. In the afternoon of the

                    <p>Egypt is shortly to have what are called "solar motors." The heat of the sun,
                        so long neglected as a practical factor in producing power as applied to
                        industries, is being taken up seriously, and another generation (or our own)
                        will see the land dotted over with devices of one kind or another for
                        gathering and con centrating the heat and power, arriving at the earth from
                        the sun, and heretofore absolutely waited, so far as human utility is
                        concerned. One development of the practical use of solar heat is the solar
                        motor. This is so designed na to automatically face the sun at all times of
                        the day, and by the use of a steam boiler in ita focus, produces steam at a
                        high pressure, and in great quantity, for any use</p>
                    <p>One of these devices is to-day in actual practical use in Arisons, at
                        Willcox, and is pumping all the water needed for irrigating a very large
                        farm in that arid,country. Others, sopording to a correspondent of the New
                        York Herald (Paris), are being sent to Egypt and South Africa</p>
                    <p>The greal economic problem solved by the utilisation of the sun's heat is, of
                        course, the practical production of power to say degree without cost of
                        fuel</p>
                    <p>That this will be developed more and more As the years go by, producing power
                        where fual is absent or its price prohibitive, seems now an unquestionable
                        fact,</p>

                    <dateline>London, November 22,</dateline>
                    <p>The annual general meeting of the Anglo- Egyptian Bank (Limited) was held
                        this after noon. The report and balance sheet were passed, and the dividend
                        of 15% declared which, includ ing the dividend of 10% for the first six
                        months, made a dividend of 13 per cent on the twelve months' working.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman, in the course of his speech, gave some details as to the issue
                        of the 20,000 new shares. The shareholders took up the quota to which they
                        were entitled to the extent of 18,000; the remaining 2,000 were sold on the
                        Stock Exchange at £12 each nett to the bank, or £2 premium on the issue
                        price, giving the bank a profit of £4,000. From this must be deducted
                        £1,000, the cost of issue (mostly Government stamps), leaving a nett profit
                        of £3,000. This £3,000 is to be devoted to paying the staff a bonus of 10
                        per cent. on their salaries for the past year. This decision met with the
                        hearty approval of those presant</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then went on to state that the capital of the bank was one
                        million and a-half, of which half a million is paid up. The reserve fund is
                        also half a million, equal to the paid-up capital. He then sketched the
                        policy of the Board in dealing with the profit. The first charge on the
                        profit will be £62,500,, or 12 per cent. dividend on-the capital of half a
                        million; the second charge, subscription to staff provident fund £1,500; the
                        third charge, the very large amount of £30,000 to establish a pension fund
                        for the benefit of the staff. This is undoubtedly a very large, sum, equal,
                        as it is, to 6 per cent, on the capital of the bank. The £30,000 will become
                        the property of the staff, and the scheme for its appropria- tion to
                        individuals will be carefully drawn up. The chairman then dealt with the
                        general outlines of the pension fund. The meeting ended without any
                        incident, the shareholders prosent expressing their general satisfaction
                        with the prosperous position of the bank's</p>

                    <p>News from the Mediterranean Fleet states that the first-clas cruiser Aboukir
                        (Captain Sir C. J. Graves Bala Bart, M.V.0) took first place in the recent
                        long-range firing, par ticulars of which were given some time ago in these
                        notes. The battleship Montagu (Captain T. B. 8. Adair) was a good second,
                        Indeed, all the cruisers and battleships shot well.</p>
                    <p>For a considerable time shorter commissions abroad have been strongly urged
                        on in these notes, both in the interests of the health of the officers and
                        men and the efficiency of our squadrons. The Admiralty has just announced
                        that in the future his Majesty's ships will be commissioned for periods of
                        two years instead of three. This will be a great boon to all ranks, Another
                        important point in that re- pairs will not be allowed to accumulate, As we
                        often the case under the three years rule. The first ship to be commissioned
                        under the new conditions is the first-class cruiser Sutlej, which will be
                        commisioned at Ports mouth on the 19th inst. for service on the China
                        station.</p>
                    <p>While I am in hearty sympathy with the. appeal of the National Association
                        for the employment of Reserviste and time-expired soldiers; it is much to be
                        feared that the re sponse will prove disappointing. With all the good will
                        in the world, most employers of labour are compelled, by commercial stagna
                        tion, to reduce rather than increase the hum- ber of people in their
                        service, with the result that they are less able than when business is brisk
                        to comply with such appeals But it is an utterly vicious system which makes
                        the Empire's gallant defenders, whether sailors or soldiers dependent on
                        such chances of subsistence after they retire. Yesterday I came across a
                        striking letter from a Time Expired Tommy," illustrating from his own
                        experiences the ingratitude of the State to his class. Of blameless
                        character, and in possession of two war medals with six clasps, be served
                        for a little over thirteen years before passing back into civil life. With.
                        sach an excellent record, he had every right to count on receiving one of
                        the many thou- sands of berths which are in the gift of the State But
                        although he registered his nama both at the Ariy Clothing Stores and the
                        Royal Laboratory nearly three years ago, be is apparently as far as ever
                        from attaining his desire. We are aware, of course, that something has been
                        dose during recent years, especially by the Post Office But if recruiting
                        for the Army is to be extended to classes which now refuse to enlist, as Mr.

                    <p>Monday and Tuesday were closed days and the Gunny market opened yesterday
                        very strong, the firmness being due to the rather excited state of the loose
                        Jate market, both here and spoustry, and higher prices have been paid by
                        Home buyers and spinners for Jute</p>
                    <p>A good amount of inter bazaar, business was pat shrough in Gunnies amongst
                        dealers during the holidays, and with some shippers covering up their
                        requirements, prices have farther barded and the tendency is still upwaitis
                        Almost all consuming centres have been patting in enquiries, such as were
                        for prompt shipment being mot as far as possible from second hand holdings,
                        while for forward de liveries, mills are quoting very cautiously, and
                        speenlative bolders in some instances have <cb n="3"/> been unloading on
                        terms most advantageous to themselves.</p>
                    <p>For local requirements fair quantities of E bags have been taken for
                        Jan./April, and with the Crops that will have to be handled, there should be
                        a big consumption of both E bags and 2 16 B Twills for Bombay and the up
                        country markets. Heavy C bags were also largely takes at Rs. 25-8, both by
                        speculatori and Burmah skippers, right on to Jute next year, and with the
                        Straits and Far East operating later the tendency is to a higher level of
                        prices</p>
                    <p>HESSIANS are firmer and do not look like giving way in value. Rs,12-4 is the
                        nominal quotation for wheat bags, with no sellers, while Rs. 10 has been
                        paid for 40 10 dn eloth for Jan./June, and Rs. 7-14 for 40 8 oz. Jan. March
                        and Rs. 7-12 April-June. These are the last rates at which business has been
                        done, and mills are reluctant to go on. next month's goods are at a premium,
                        more especially nine porter cloth, and nothing can be had now at Rs. 8 for
                        Nov./Dec. Elevenporter cloth is more easily obtainable in moderate
                        quantities at Rs. 10-4 and Rs. 10 respectively.</p>

                    <dateline>PARIS, November 7.</dateline>
                    <p>We here taken so kindly to English ways that, for two days this week, we were
                        enjoying Lendin "particular"-almost. The fog was not quite of the yellowish
                        hue that prevails by the banks of the Thames, but it had sufficient</p>
                    <p>stency-and a sufficient blackness to cause a general lighting up at noon. I
                        have just met French friend, who said, "I have come from London. Do you
                        know-it is astonish ingthere was no fog there. The first I saw was at Havre,
                        where the boat had to remain half an hour outside the harbour, because of
                        it. The cold and the rain and the fog are the usual heralds of the winter in
                        Paris. If you wish for another sign you have it in the disconsolate crowd
                        that besieges the doors of the municipal, refuges. It says something for
                        British prosperity that of the fifteen hundred of all nationalities applying
                        for relief last month, only one spoke with the tongue of the Englishman.</p>
                    <p>The ratification of the Anglo-French Agreement having been voted in the
                        Chamber by 443 to 105, we may now take it that the Senate will follow suit,
                        and that final success willetown the work upon which M. Delcassé and Lord
                        Lansdowne are to be heartily con gratulated. Nevertheless, it is to be
                        regretted that, while the Agreement is accepted as a whole, a resolution
                        should have been proposed and carried which affirmed that the Chamber counts
                        on M. Delcassé to open negotiations with the British Government, as soon as
                        possible, with a view to "improving the Newfoundland Convention. That
                        Convention will, of course, when ratified by the Senate, be binding upon the
                        two Governments; but M. Veloise is charged with the task of getting it
                        altered to meet the requirements, real or imaginary, of the French fishing
                        industry. I am sorry that the Chamber has laid that duty up the Foreign
                        Minister; I hoped that the troublesome question of the "French Shore" would
                        be settled once and for ever; and the fact that it will not be finally
                        settled by the present Convention constitutes a distinct drawback to
                        complete satisfaction. However, there is no reason to fear that England and
                        France will quarrel over the matter, and we must be content with that we
                        have got. Perfection is not of this world.</p>
                    <p>It is a funny country, this country of hair splitting and of duelling. Why M.
                        Syveton smacked General André in the face has been &amp; mystery to
                        everybody, but a greater one is why, as one of his officers has chosen to
                        make the insult offered to the Minister of War a personal matter, as Captain
                        de Gail, ot the 1lenie. Cuirassiers, has done, he should not be allowed to
                        fight M. Syveton and be done with it. After all, be merely acted as an
                        officer standing up for the Army, and is not that what we are constantly
                        inciting officers to do! De Gail is an aristocrat by birth, and has always
                        marked himself out as being more of a thinker than most of those of his
                        class in the Army. What he has done in challenging dyveton may be a rash and
                        a foolhanty act, but one cannot help feeling glad that some French officer
                        should do such a thing after Friday's most disgraceful incident.</p>
                    <p>As to André, he is, it appears, very ill, for M. Byleton's blow was a
                        thundering one; but I think it is pure "méchanceté" that makes the
                        journalists talk about his "ratelier", having been deranged. They merely
                        want to throw ridicule upon him, and of that there is plenty to throw, "Dieu
                        le sait!" Meanwhile, he is andoubtedly ill, and as far as it is at present
                        known, both M. Syveton and M. de Gail are under arrest. M. Syveton was
                        arrested just as the duel was about to take place, and there was a rumour

                        this country, and in all probability the general public will not know more
                        of this affair until it is all over. En attendant, persons who are really

                        have some other reason, private or otherwise, for showing up the methods
                        General André has employed in the carrying out of what he doubtless
                        considered his duty, are busily exposing the recent manoeuvres of the
                        Masonic Lodges in the Army, and the Gaulois and other papers are full of
                        revelations on the subject. This is, doubtless, quite right, and 1 on only,
                        imagine that good should come out of the whole thing. That it will bring
                        about a fresh Dreyfus disturbance I can hardly believe. I believed last year
                        that such a thing as a fevival of that famous affair was not only possible,
                        but even imminent. It is only fair that one should be allowed to change
                        one's opinions when one has a reason for so doing, and I now believe quite
                        the contrary. I believe that such a thing would be considered by most
                        inffoential Republicans as a danger to the Repablin, so great has been the

                    <p>Another series of duelé has shaken, Paris to its dépths. In two pistols were
                        used, and-the seconds having apparently exercised the cus fomary care in
                        loading them harmlessly there was, of course, no result. One of the en

                        Gait. The affair with swords was a more serious matter, General Andre's son
                        being distinetly pricked in the wrist. The victims afterwards rode agay on
                        his bicycle, with much less inconvenience than if he had taken part in a

                    <p>The language of the Papal allocation on the ecclesiastical situation in
                        France is informed by spirit of diguity and moderation. On this ocession
                        Plus X. would seem to have derived bie inspiration from the consummate
                        states <cb n="2"/>manship of his illustrious predecessor. More he might
                        certainly have said; but he would have gained nothing by saying it-indeed,
                        he would only have played straight into the hands of enemies of the Church,
                        who would have bated his protest as unmistakable evidence of Papal hostility
                        to the Republic. They will do that as it is of course. But they will not be
                        able to get over the plain declaration of his Holi news that the profession
                        of Christianity can be in complete accord with a Republican form of
                        government. It can, no doubt; but, as French Christianity is learning, to
                        its cost, the anti- Christian influences which dominate the policy of France
                        at the present time have no desire to work in harmony with the Church. On
                        the contrary, it is their deliberate intention to suppress Christianity, if
                        they can.. They will fail, of course; but their failure will not be made
                        manifest without grievous spiritual suffer ing and spiritual loss.</p>
                    <p>There are certainly two opinions as to the expediency of the Channel tunnel,
                        but 1 imagine that if Paris were polled on the subject of the Champs Elysées
                        "tube" it would return an emphatic "yes" It is the latest pro jeet to build
                        subterranean passages at the most important points beneath the principal
                        swennes of this great thoroughfare. For long the pedestrian pablie have
                        taken their lives in their hands in attempting to "negotiate" the formidable
                        stream of traffic that sweepe by at certain hours of the day, almost without

                    <p>Prance and England are happily very good friends, but as joint administrators
                        of the New Hebrides they can hardly be described as a success. One of the
                        French papers in the neighbouring island of New Caledonis, referring to a
                        recent massacre in the New Hebrides, describes the condition of this group
                        as "Hagrant anarchy," and says neither life nor property is safe there.
                        Furthermore, both France and England "incur a serious responsibility" in,
                        encouraging settlers to emigrate there under the present governing
                        arrangements. French rights and interests in the New Hebrides are described
                        as "incontestably predominant," and the suggested solution of existing evils
                        is the voluntary retirement of England from the scene and the part nership.
                        That remedy, however, would be far from popular either in England ok in
                        Australia That peculiarly Parisian institution, the "revue," is more or less
                        a standing dish in the music-halls, but as the year begins to wane, it
                        partakes more and more of the character of the English pantomime in its
                        allusion to recent and current events. The Alliance, unfortanstely, forbids,
                        but one can imagine the fun that sprightly French artists of the "Cafe
                        concert" would extract from the ludicrous story of the Russians in the North
                        Sea. Another incident most certainly to be seized upon is the escape and
                        subsequent arrest of M Syveton. The escapade has little that is noble in it,
                        but the "revue" lets who will be moralist, it simply amuses. One has need of
                        an extensive knowledge of "argot" and of all the hamifica tions of French
                        politics to thoroughly appre ciate the niceties of a Paris revue" where
                        parody is piled on parody, and paradox upon paradox, often with a talent and
                        a brilliance that are bewilderingly clever. The quality of the jokes may be
                        strained, but they generally drop in the right place.</p>
                    <p>Americans have known how to turn the theatres of London into a gold mine, and
                        they are about to Americanise the theatres of Paris. According to statements
                        made in the local press, a powerful syndicste has been formed, and it is
                        proposed to found as many as ten new theatres in the French capital.
                        Playwrights quake at the thought. At present they haye a society strong
                        enough to prevent managers from crushing them under the weight of com-
                        petition. But in presence of a trust which can control ten theatres, a
                        bitter struggle against the power of capital is feared.</p>

                        inventory of old pledges remaining or gone. This year a small object pledged
                        for 12s. 8d. in 1869 has been withdrawn, after 36 annual renewals, in-
                        volving £1 138.-4d. Among the other "relics" still remaining is a mantel
                        ornament pledged for 5 22 years ago, and regularly renewed. But the champion
                        "relie" of the place is an ivoryheaded cane, on which the owner has paid
                        74d. a year since 1859.</p>

                    <p>SAINT ANDREW'S FOOTBALL CLUB. This fixture was brought off on the parade
                        ground at Mustapha Pasha on Saturday after noon in lovely weather and before
                        a good turnout of spectators. The Signallers started the game with the wind
                        at their backs and were early in the vicinity of Curtis &amp; Co. Keill was
                        soon in evidence, and through his tackling and clearing the Saints began to
                        gain ground. Neither team for a time could claim any great advantage, the
                        play being pretty much of the give-and-take order. The Saints' forwards were
                        not displaying any brilliancy in their movements, and in this department
                        certainly the homesters were the superior lot. Cowie was their front-rank
                        warrior, and be, supported by good half-back play, steadied the attack.. The
                        Signallers defence, however, was not found wanting, both New and Harper
                        offering active opposition. The first point of the game fell to the Saints,
                        and came from the foot of Hutchings. That player, taking up the ball close
                        in and lifting: it over the heads of all, placed it just out of Quarterman's
                        reach. The Signallers tried hard to square before the interval and certainly
                        their play deserved to meet with some success. Their efforts, however, were
                        unavailing, and the interval arrived with the score: Saint Andrew's 1,
                        Signallers 0.</p>
                    <p>The restart gave promise of a very fast moiety. The Signallers were evidently
                        bent on penetrating the visitors' defence, but Keill and Fitzgerald were
                        playing a sterling game, and were well supported by the halves. Curtis, too,
                        seemed to be in his element. Still the homesters persevered and reward at
                        last attended their efforts, Saxton patting a beauty which Curtis in
                        clearing over-ran. This gave the other forwards an opening which they were
                        not slow to take advantage of, and the score stood one all. From the
                        kick-off play was pretty much confined to midfield. The remaining twenty
                        minutes was very finely contested, but no other scoring took place. The
                        whistle sounded with the score. Signallers 1, Saint Andrew's 1. The
