                    <head>PRINCE HOHENLOHE'S DIARY</head>
                    <p>Commenting on the publication of the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe, the
                        "Morning Post" says:-</p>
                    <p>A twofold interest attaches to the publication in Germany of extracts from
                        the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe giving an account of the points of
                        disagreement between the German Emperor and Prince Bismarck which led to the
                        Prince's resignation of the Chancellorship of the Empire. The resignation of the First Chancellor was an event of historical
                        importance, and everything that throws light upon it and enables the truth
                        to be known is valuable to the student of history and of politics. The fact
                        of the publication of these extracts from Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs has,
                        however, to be regarded also from another point of view. The story told
                        throws light upon the character and policy of the present German Emperor.
                        The publication, therefore, would hardly have been risked in a country where
                        free discussion of the Emperor's character and policy is not permitted,
                        unless it was likely to be acceptable in high quarters. It may, therefore,
                        be taken to be thought opportune that these disclosures should now be made;
                        in other words, it is thought that they will have the effect in Germany of
                        strengthening public confidence in the Emperor. The story told is
                        exceedingly probable. It agrees with what was relieved at the time by the
                        best inform<cb n="6"/>ed diplomatists in Europe. Moreover, it rests upon the best
                        possible authorities, for Prince Hohenlohe records his conversations with
                        the Empress Frederick and the Grand Duke of Baden, as well as with the
                        Emperor and Prince Bisraark. The disagreements turned on two points of
                        policy. One was domestic. The Emperor was anxious for further action by way
                        of relieving the lot of the working class.</p>
                    <p>He thought that if nothing were done the Socialists would have a lever by
                        which they might raise up a movement that would need to be put down by
                        force, and he was determined at the beginning of his reign not to be forced
                        to let his soldiers Are upon the people. But Bismarck was opposed to further
                        legislation in the direction of State Socialism. The other difference was on
                        foreign policy. The Emperor thought it right to support his Austro-Hungarian
                        ally in resistance to contemplated Russian encroachments in South- Eastern
                        Europe. If the Russian Government had moved an Army towards Bulgaria the
                        Austro-Hungarian Government would have been bound in its own interests to
                        that movement. The German Emperor thought that in such a case he must come
                        to the assistance of Austria-Hungary. But Bismarck proposed that if the case
                        were to arise Germany should remain neutral. He was afraid that supporting
                        Austria would involve Germany in the war which he dreaded against Russia and
                        France at once. These were serious differences, for they touched, the one a
                        vital matter of domestic policy, and the other the cardinal point of foreign
                        policy. But there was a further disagreement of a formal nature. When
                        Bismarck became Minister-President of Prussia under King William I. there
                        was in existence a Cabinet Order, that is, a Royal rescript, dated 1852-in
                        the reign of King Frederick William IV.-by which the Ministers other than
                        the Minister-President were debarred from direct access to the King.
                        Bismarck, as Minister-President, for many years acted in the spirit of this
                        decree. He made himself responsible to the King for Prussian policy, and he
                        enjoyed the King's confidence. Accordingly at one time he paid little
                        attention to the letter of the decree. But, on the accession of William II.
                        as Emperor and King, Bismarck worked the decree of 1852 for all it was worth
                        in order to keep in his own hands the control of affairs. The Emperor wished
                        to be able to consult other Ministers as well as Bismarck, and desired the
                        old rule to 1)6 abrogated. When it became clear to him that there was a real
                        and profound disagreement between himself and his Chancellor he sent to ask
                        Bismarck for either his acquiescence in the abrogation of the rule or his
                        resignation. Bismarck replied by sending his resignation. The Emperor felt
                        that the point had come when it was a question whether he should be Emperor
                        in fact as well as in name, or merely an Emperor reigning but not governing,
                        taking his directions from a Mayor of the Palace. This part of the story has
                        been told before. The exact nature of the disagreement on Germany's foreign
                        policy has hardly been as clearly put, so far as we remember, as it is in
                        Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs. Very characteristic are some of the details of
                        the picture. Bismarck's violent temper was well known. He has himself told
                        how after a political argument he would relieve his feelings by breaking
                        something. After one of the last angry outbursts the Emperor told the Grand
                        Duke of Baden that Bismarck had just managed not to throw the inkpot at his
                        head, and the Grand Duke himself a few days later found Bismarck so rude
                        that he had to bring the audience to an abrupt close. In all probability the
                        Emperor was substantially in the right on the points in dispute. It was
                        wiser to take some steps towards meeting the working-men's troubles than to
                        do nothing and await a conflict. It was probably wiser and was certainly
                        more loyal to support Austria-Hungary against Russia than to remain neutral
                        and encourage Russia. It was certainly better for Germany that there should
                        be a Monarchy than that there should be a Bismarck dynasty. The interesting
                        question is why the present moment should be chosen for the publication of
                        these details. The purpose maybe to stem the growth of the Bismarck legend,
                        which has been remarkable during the last few years, and to remind the
                        German public that, great as Bismarck was, he was nothing without the
                        support of King William I., and in his quarrel with the present Emperor was
                        in form and substance in the wrong. A different explanation has been
                        suggested, very shrewdly, in Austria. There the theory is that the
                        publication has for its purpose to show, what is the fact, that in a crisis
                        when the fate of the Dual Monarchy was at stake the Emperor William was that
                        Monarchy's firm friend and steadfast ally. In either case, we venture to
                        think, only good can come of the truth becoming known. There is a good deal
                        yet to be known about Bismarck, not by any means all to his credit. He
                        himself, by the heartless cruelty with which he persecuted those who
                        happened to disagree with him, made upon those who were behind the scenes an
                        indelible impression of brutality. He was a bully, and his policy was that
                        of a bully. The revelations nowmade, which will in part be new to the bulk
                        of the German public, will help German opinion to see in truer perspective
                        the personages of the reign of the first Emperor, whom in the public eye
                        Bismarck has too much overshadowed. Moltke was a greater man than the
                        Germans of to-day. except a small number of officers, seem to realise, and
                        the Emperor William I, who was able to appreciate and to support two such
                        different men as Bismarck and Moltke and to keep them together in harness in
                        spite of their differences, rendered to his country services which can
                        hardly be over-estimated. One result of the publication now made may be to
                        stimulate curiosity as to the later portions of Bismarck's own Memoirs. It
                        is hardly likely that they will modify very materially the story which is
                        told in the contemporary notes of Prince Hohenlohe. </p>

                    <p>This morning £1,280,000 sterling arrived at Alexandria by the Austrian
                        Lloyd's S.S. Habshurg, and another large shipment of gold is expected next
                        week. London, October 8. The American demand for gold having sunk into the
                        background, the London Money Market only finds itself face to face with a
                        strong enquiry for sovereigns on Egyptian account. A demand of this kind had
                        to be dealt with for a good many years, and in earlier times the outflow of
                        sovereigns in the late autumn and winter was usually followed by the reflux
                        of a considerable proportion of the amount in the spring. The coins, which
                        are legal tender in Egypt, are needed to assist the bank in financing the
                        cotton crop, which has become so important a factor in Egyptian production,
                        and this explains the movement to and fro. Latterly, however, the prosperity
                        of the country has been great, that only a small proportion of the
                        sovereigns dispatched. There have returned, the remainder being either
                        retained by the banks kept in circulation, and therefore the exports recent
                        years from this side have taken more and more the character of a positive
                        loss to our fa supplies. In one sense this retention of the coins was
                        expected to diminish the demand each year, as the stock held in the country
                        steadily grew larger. These expectations, however, have been upset by the
                        storm in the Southern States of the United States, which has led to a
                        remarkable advance in the price of cotton, and has produced a strong demand
                        for gold by the Egyptian banks. Since the Bank return was made up £1,600,000
                        has been taken out, and the manner in which these withdrawals have suddenly
                        assumed importance certainly renders the maintenance of the Bank rate at 4
                        per cent, distinctly uncertain. </p>

                    <head>NATIVES AND EUROPEAN LADIES</head>
                    <p>We have already had occasion to refer to the insulting language and conduct
                        of certain low elements in the native population towards European and Syrian
                        ladies-. Our Cairo Correspondent, confirming the case which we reported on
                        Saturday, writes : - Another instance of a serious character occurred on
                        Thursday evening, when the cries of a European child of seven years of age,
                        who was struggling to free herself from the grasp of a native, brought a
                        French passer-by to the rescue. An Englishman came in, and after some
                        difficulty the native was overpowered and taken to the caracol. A number of
                        hi3 friends assembled, and q rite oblivious of the cause of his capture,
                        threatened to murder his captors. </p>
                    <p>We hope the leaders of native opinion will exert themselves to prevent any
                        recurrence of similar incidents. We are aware that certain email class of
                        Moslem affects to consider that the fact that a woman is unveiled excuses
                        insulting language and behaviour, but Europeans have been too long settled
                        in the country for this "excuse"-if such detestable and unmanly conduct can
                        possibly be excused-to be accepted. In towns like Cape Town where a small
                        Moslem colony is settled in the midst of a large Ditch and British
                        population and in Trinidad or Demarara, where there are settlements of
                        Indian Moslems, Moslem women are safe from insult or annoyance. </p>

                    <head>THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-<lb/>PROPOSALS OF THE FOUNDERS.</head>
                    <p>We have received from Kassim Bey Amin, secretary to the committee formed for
                        the establishment of a National University, a circular, of which the
                        following is a translation:-</p>
                    <p>In latter years a general movement towards education has been observed in
                        Egypt. Among all classes this tendency exists and goes on increasing. In
                        spite of the sacrifices which the State has made, the education no long
                        supplies the needs of the country. The progressive increase of the budget of
                        the Ministry of Public Instruction has not been able to satisfy the needs of
                        the population. The Government has found itself forced to stimulate private
                        initiative so that they might gain assistance. Our nation, which is not
                        accustomed to establish such institutions, has, nevertheless, answered to
                        its appeal by subscribing largely for the creation of primary
                        schools-kuttabs. Every day we register the birth of one of these schools
                        some part of Egypt. In a few years' time one will see them in their full
                        expansion, and our little ohildren will gather the full benefit. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately the Government and the nation who have done all in their power
                        to extend primary education have op to the present been able to do nothing
                        to develope higher education. Time and money have been lacking to inaugurate
                        the formation of school for higher studies. To-day Egyptians are beginning
                        to feel that there is their education a very large gap which must be fulled.
                        For the last ten years the creation of a university has incessantly
                        preoccupied them. Many efforts, even, were made by several benevolent men,
                        but it seemed that the idea was not sufficiently ripe to be realisable.</p>
                    <p>This year a favorable movement has spontaneously swayed public opinion. Our
                        people have at last come to the conclusion that its system of education is
                        incomplete ; that its limits are too narrow; that it ends too soon; that
                        beyond the circle where it is confined there are sublime experiences, lofty
                        troths, transcendental speculations, interesting problems, seductive
                        hypotheses, new discoveries, captivating essays that occupy and preoccupy
                        the souls of the intellectual elect of the world, and of which only a faint
                        echo reaches it. There are new theories on the universe, society, human
                        language, morals, philosophy, history, legislation, education. All that
                        refers to the present, past, and future of humanity forms the object of many
                        sciences. Which of us knows anything about it ? Who is interested in these
                        sciences, and in these sources of wisdom ?</p>
                    <p>But what is truly astonishing is this. There is not in the whole of Egypt a
                        class where are taught the literary, scientific, and philosophical works of
                        the best known and most appreciated in Europe of the ancient Arab authors !
                        All Egyptians who are truly conscious of the inferiority of oar intellectual
                        state, and who suffer thereat, have felt that another step must be made in
                        the education of Egyptian youth.</p>
                    <p>In order that Egypt may be admitted to the ranks of civilized countries, it
                        does not suffice that the majority of its population know how to read and
                        write, nor, farther, that a class be firmed for professional knowledge, such
                        as doctor', lawyers, engineers, etc. More is needed. Those who have a
                        calling to raise themselves to the ranks of the savants, the writers that
                        Europe produces, should be allowed to ' elevate themselves to equal in
                        knowledge and intelligence the great artisans of Progress who in shadow and
                        silence work night and day for the conquest of truth and its triumph in the
                        world. It is this work that-we desire to undertake with the help of all the
                        inhabitants of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>We know that isolated State action is powerless to do all, that its goodwill
                        and power must be seconded by private initiative. We hope that our voice
                        will be heard by all those who live Egypt, no matter what their origin
                        correlation. </p>
                    <p>This foundation having awakened in minds different ideas, we deem it well to
                        define in a general way the objective of our work : -</p>
                    <p>I. The University that we desire to create is to be absolutely scientific and
                        literary. Its doors will be wide open for all desirous of learning,
                        irrespective of origin and religion.</p>
                    <p>II. It will have no connection at all with politics, or even with men who
                        occupy themselves with politics. Neither in its administration nor in the
                        classes to be organised will it tolerate the least interference, or
                        influence, that may have a greater or less degree of public character.</p>
                    <p>III. The foundation of a university uniting in itself all the orders to
                        education-primary, secondary, and higher-will be for ns an ideal that we
                        will strive to attain in a fa tare that is more or less near, and as such
                        forms part of our programme. But it is evident that the complete and
                        immediate realisation of a work enormous, will require considerable
                        resources, a staff and organisation that are difficult to realise at
                        present. We are, therefore, obliged to carry out for the present only part
                        of our programme, beginning with that which has appeared to us most urgent
                        and most profitable. Moreover, the primary and secondary education, and that
                        which we have called professional, exists already in the State and private
                        schools, and nearly satisfies our needs. Moreover, it has seemed to ns that
                        for the present we may without inconvenience not occupy ourselves therewith,
                        reserving all our efforts to inaugurate higher education which is lacking in
                        our country. Wo will create professorships to teach what is not taught in
                        Egypt : Chairs of Arabic and European literature, sciences, philosophy, and
                        history. These will be filled by professors carefully chosen in Europe, and
                        Egypt when they are available, under the direction pf a technical committee
                        presided over by a both competent and experienced man. Naturally the number
                        and "importance of these classes will depend upon the resources of the
                        University. </p>
                    <p>IV. The classes will be public, so that all desirous of learning may attend
                        them. Bat in addition to this attendance of persons of all ages and all
                        professions who attend a class to pass their time in an agreeable and
                        profitable manner, the University will admit enrolled students who will
                        follow all the classes daring a certain number of years. These students will
                        undergo ad\examination at the close of their studies, and receive a diploma
                        similar to that awarded by the school of political and moral science at
                        Paris. It is understood that the diploma will only have a moral authority,
                        but it is to be hoped that in course of time our Government will take it
                        into consideration and attach special privileges to it. </p>
                    <p>V. The meeting of the present subscribers will elect two committees, one of
                        which will be appointed to collect subscriptions, and the other with the
                        technical preparation of the education. Such is th8 programme of those who
                        were the first subscribers for the foundation of the University. Some will
                        find it ambitious and difficult to realise in Egypt: we will reply to them
                        that we will spare nothing to succeed. If despite our good intentions this
                        work fails to be effected, we hope that others, more able, will know how to
                        do better. Others, and they are in the majority, find the work modest, and
                        not so brilliant and so extended as they would desire. To these we will say
                        that success can only be obtained by knowing the measure of one's strength.
                        We would willingly reply to them : Help us for the present to lay this
                        modest foundation ; success will encourage us to do more. The day when we
                        find that our means will permit of our extending the education in the
                        University and widening its field of action, you will find us always beside
                        you, to go forward with you hand in hand. </p>

                    <head>THE "PATRIOT'S" RETURN-<lb/>MODESTY FORBIDS EXUBERANCE. </head>
                    <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel arrived at Alexandria from Europe this morning by the
                        Austrian Lloyd S.S. Habsburg.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian "Patriot" had modestly but firmly declined when in Europe all
                        the overtures his Nationalist followers had made him to greet his arrival
                        with a demonstration on the quay. He also refused the offer of a special
                        train to Cairo, and declared that he did not wish the train in which he
                        travelled to be greeted with acclamations on its passage down the main line
                        to the Capital, and that the inhabitants of the towns and villages were not
                        to tarn out en masse to salute him. </p>
                    <p>The reason for this modesty is because he is only at the beginning of the
                        mighty work to which he intends to devote all his life, energy, and talents,
                        and therefore, although he has been most successful in his political mission
                        to Europe, any manifestation would be premature. But when the goal is
                        reached he will be quite willing to accept the public homage of the Egyptian
                        people. The result was that when Kamel set foot on Egyptian soil only his
                        brother Aly Fehmy and a few others greeted him and he was taken to the
                        station in quite an ordinary conveyance and passed unrecognized through the
                        streets.' </p>

                    <head>KAMEL'S COMPARISONS.</head>
                    <p>In a recent interview with the Correspondent of the "Pall Mall Gazette"
                        Mustapha Pasha Kamel had an interesting story to tell concerning the light
                        punishment accorded to two Greek malefactors who had assaulted a couple of
                        British officers. </p>
                    <p>The facts of the case are as follows :- Two drunken Greeks engaged in a
                        scuffle with two unknown Europeans, who wore no uniform, whose nationality
                        was not even recognised, who slipped away on the arrival of the police and
                        who never appeared to prosecute their assailants. The real assault for which
                        these Greeks were punished was committed on the persons of two policemen,
                        whom they beat and kicked. </p>
                    <p>To crown all, when brought to the caracol, they attempted to set the building
                        on fire. Tiny were sentenced to 21 days' imprisonment followed by instant
                        expulsion from the country. A sufficiently severe sentence. As the
                        "Nationalist" leader attempts to make capital oat of this incident, by
                        instituting comparisons between his version thereof and the Deuishwai
                        affair, we should like to remind our confrère of a proverb, English in its
                        origin, bat none the less applicable in Egypt. It runs thus : "Old wounds
                        are skinned by lying." </p>

                    <head>KHEDIYIAL YACHT CLUB.<lb/>SATURDAY'S SPECIAL REGATTA</head>
                    <p>- VISIT OF THE KHEDIVE- The annual visit of his Highness the Khedive to the
                        Yacht Club on Saturday was attended, as usual, with immense success. The
                        morning opened with a strong wind from the S.E., which threatened to mar the
                        proceedings, but towards coon the wind gradually died down and veered round
                        to the W.N.W., where it remained for a little while and then died away
                        altogether. At 2 o'clock the club, the Commodore's yacht Cuhona and the
                        schooner Gilda dressed ship" and soon after the club began to fill op with
                        all its members, including most of the elite of Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>Down on the foreshore accommodation was provided for the patrons of the
                        rowing dubs who were interested in the race between their respective dubs.
                        His Highness arrived punctually at half-past four and was received at the
                        club steps by Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan and the committee of the club. x The
                        sailing handicap in Class I was won by the Ananke, which was guided to
                        victory by Mr. J. C. Wilcock, the Sans Pareille being a good second, only 36
                        seconds ^behind. The wind was so dead before Class II. was sailed that the
                        race became simply a "drifting 1 match." It seemed at first as if none of
                        the 1 boats would finish in time to claim the price, but eventually the
                        Iskindiryah, sailed by Mr. H. Fender], drifted over the finishing line with
                        10 minutes to spare, thereby winning the Khedive's challenge cup. The rest
                        of the boats kept crawling in far away into the night, and some of them had
                        to be towed home, the wind having completely died away at sunset. </p>
                    <p>Soon after his Highness arrived a race be- ion ten native boats of the old
                        type was started, all their sails being set before the' start and their
                        stern tied up to the club jetty. When the gun was fired they all cast off,
                        and everything being allowed fair in this race there was a good deal of
                        excitement, which would have been greater if the wind had been stronger. The
                        next race, which aoudad the greatest excitement, was that of the rowing
                        clubs in their outriggers. They were started at a point half-way between the
                        break water elbow and the lighthouse, at a distance of 2,500 metres from the
                        club. From the fire of the pistol the Club International Canottieri started
                        away with an even stroke and a steady boat and took the lead which they
                        maintained to the end, beating the Club Nautique Francois by about 5
                        lengths; this club also made a very good show, especially as their boat was
                        heavier and 20 centimetres broader than that of the winners. Moreover their
                        bow oar had met with an accident three days before the race and had been
                        replaced by a spare oar who had not had much time to, practise. The Deutsche
                        Sovereign, also in as a heavy a boat as that of the French Club, crossed the
                        line third, being about 4 lengths. behind the Frenchmen. The Alexandria
                        Rowing Club then followed, their boat seeming to suffer from unsteadiness
                        from the start, although of approximately the same beam as the Canottieri.
                        The winner's time was 9 min. 14 secs. </p>
                    <p>As soon as the boats hove in sight, the members of the rowing clubs watching
                        from the jetty could restrain themselves no longer and burst into cheering,
                        shouting and waving their oars, especially those of the winning club. This
                        is the third year that the Canottieri have won the race. Soon after this
                        race the oared gigs hove in sight, there being four boats entered. That of
                        the Coastguard training ship, Dib el-Bahr, was the winner, and that of the
                        Ports and Lights second-an exceedingly creditable performance considering
                        that they had had no chance of practising, only getting the boat in which
                        they polled in at noon on the day of the race. The Coastguard harbour
                        department and H.M.S. Venus followed. At the close of the races his Highness
                        presented the oops to the winners, congratulating them on their success. He
                        expressed his pleasure at all he had seen and wished the club every success
                        in the future, promising his patronage as of old. The Egyptian Army band
                        played selections of music during the afternoon. The committee wish to
                        acknowledge the kindness of the Alexandria Municipality, and of the City
                        Polio and Coastguard Administration, who assisted in keeping order on shore
                        and afloat. </p>

                        5 feet at the 90 yards mark, but Darton, swimming, grandly eventually won.
                        an exciting race by a yard, with Ecclestone about 3 yards behind. The silver
                        cup was presented by H. P. Kingham, Erq, and Darton has now won the
                        championship twice in succession. Next Saturday the 100 yards juniors' and

                            195,000,000 marks. This company's last decrease of capital took place in
                            1902 (with 200,000 marks); it has a reserve fund of 26,880,000 marks.
                            The company's fleet comprises 184 steamers—viz., 86 ocean steamers, of
                            an aggregate tonnage of £57,912 registered tODS; 48 coasting steamers,
                            of an aggregate tonnage of 68,653 tons; and 50 river steamers, of an
                            aggregate of 5,849 registered tons. Last year the North German Lloyd

                        have just increased, or are about to increase, their capital very
                        materially. Heading the list stands the Hamburg-America lire, with an
                        increase of 200,000 marks, which will make the total share capital
                        120,000,000 marks, in addition to which it has a debenture capital of about
                        50,000,000 marks, while its reserve funds amount in the aggregate to some
                        27,000,000 marks. The present year is the sixtieth of the company's
                        existence, and at the end of last year its fleet had an aggregate tonnage of
                        811,943 registered tons gross. The last two years have been exceptionally
                        lucrative, and the revenue for 1905 amounted to about 380,000 marks, of
                        which 24,000,000 marks were applied to various writings of The directors
                        point out that the company in almost all directions is in need of new
                        tonnage, and that the building of new steamers has become a necessity. In
                        the North Atlantic trade it is proposed to employ new steamers of the
                        America and the Eastern Augusta Victoria type, of that on this route there
                        will be a weekly service of these splendid boats. One of these new ships

                        Company, of Stettin. The Hamburg-South America, the Hamburg-West Indies, and
                        the New York-West Indies services, however, also require new steamers. In
                        addition to these requirements, the company is about to start a new fast
                        service between Genoa and La Plata and Brasil. for which line two boats are
                        being built</p>

                        but was begged by the polite Khalifa to stay, as there was a present for ns.
                        So, chatting with this most agreeable of officials, we waited one , mortal
                        hour, learning incidentally not a little b of the political situation and of

                        there is no Saltan, and no Makkztn or Government. "For the moment I am
                        Saltan" is his motto and his policy. 0 On awaking, he said a word in
                        Sh'lhah, the Berber tongue, whereupon two slaves rushed in with a large
                        white clo'h, which they carefully adjusted round his boll neck, so as to
                        cover him to the knees. "Is dinner going to be served f" I whispered to

                        chin after the Moslem custom, 5 trimming the sides of the black beard, and
                        dipping the moustache. Then, removing the sweet creature's turban, he shaved
                        his head dose.</p>
                    <p>Nor was the show yet over. Colling for scissors, he stolidly favoured ns with
                        an exhibi-tion of his skill, not only as a manionriat, but as a pedionrist.
                        All this without a word addressed to the infidel visitors.</p>

                    <p>It may be imagined that this very imperfect sketch of the aroh-rabel is too
                        highly colored. I can give the solemn assurance, that in my unique interview
                        with "Kaid" Anfloos there was no need for exaggeration.</p>
                    <p>Early the next morning the present was brought to me. It tamed oat to be a

                        <p>In the "Fortnightly Review" for October, Chedo Myalovitch, former Servian
                            Minister in Constantinople, gives an nonconventional appreciation of
                            Abd-nl-Hamid, in whom he nods "a peculiar modesty, timidity, and
                            tenderness which are quite womanly. He always looks earnest, almost sad,
                            as if he were subdued by the consciousness of his great
                            responsibilities. He smiles quietly, almost sadly, very often, but he
                            hardly ever laughs loudly. He is distinctly a man of aesthetic taste. He
                            is fond of flowers, of beautiful women, of fine horses of lovely views
                            of sea and land, of everything that is beautiful. He is an affectionate
                            father. He takes care that the ladies of his harem shall BDjoy higher
                            pleasures, and provides for them concerts and theatricals. He can be,
                            and is, a friend to his friends. He is able to contract devoted deep and
                            faithful friendships. The former British Ambassador in Constantinople
                            Sir William White, won his personal friendship and retained it to the
                            end of his days.</p>
                        <p>The so-called successes of German diplomacy in Constantinople are really
                            not the successes of the supposed superior ability of German
                            diplomatists; they are limply the results of the deep personal
                            attachment of Abd nl Hamid to Emperor William.</p>
                        <p>"What I especially admire in Sultan Abd-ul- Hamid is his evident desire
                            to be fair, not to do an injustice, even indirectly, to anyone. He loves
                            to consider almost every question from a philosophical point of view. I
                            can give you a typical instance of this. When the telegrams announced
                            the formal engagement of King Alexander of Servia with Madame Drags
                            Mashin, the Sultan sent for me, asking melt the same time to bring, if I
                            could, a photograph of the King's fiancée. I did so. The Sultan looked
                            at the photograph for some time, observed that Mae. Draga was evidently
                            a handsome woman, and that she had beautiful eyes. 'Yet,' he said, in
                            his quiet, earnest manner, 'I cannot sufficiently wonder that King
                            Alexander, who seemed to me a very young man, should commit such a folly
                            ! No doubt the day will arrive when he will see dearly himself what a
                            folly he has committed.' And then, after a prolonged silence, fie
                            continued. But, after all, what right have we to complaint I What right
                            have we even to criticize? Can a I man escape his destiny. And is it
                            fair to forget what an irresistible power love has t Where is I the
                            strong man who is not weak when fie finds himself alone with a woman
                            with whom he is in love I And are - we not all liable sometimes to
                            commit follies 1 Does love ever ask what is I your rank and your dignity
                            1 Does love ever ask what your father and your mother will say to that 1
                            Does it ever listen to reason 11; verily, do not think we have a right
                            to laugh at the folly of this young man. Poor Alexander is evidently
                            deeply in love with Draga. All we can do is to wish for him that his
                            love be crowned by true and lasting happiness. I will wire him my best
                            wishes, but you mast also let him know that I shall always rejoice to
                            hear of his happiness.' Sultan Abd-nl-Hamid evidently knew what love
                            was, and he seems to have reduced his own experiences to philosophical
                            principles, which led him to be fair and obtainable to others,"</p>
                        <p>With so genial and sentimental a monarch to control the fortunes of his
                            subjects, it may be a little astonishing to learn what sort of a place
                            Constantinople is as described by a writer in 'Blackwood." Perhaps we
                            may take both accounts with a grain of salt:-- </p>
                        <p>To the foreigner the commonly accepted percentage of spies among the
                            population is simply incredible, but accounts at any rate for the
                            taciturnity of trams. The objects in a man's mind when he enrolls
                            himself as a member of this detestable profession are two-first, as an
                            unprotected subject of the Sultan to guarantee himself as far as he can
                            from the 'depositions' of others; and, secondly, of course, for the
                            pecuniary interest. It is easy to condemn this class, but often they are
                            obliged to 'eat the bread of infamy and take the wages of shame,' and
                            have only the alternative of suffering themselves and bringing rain upon
                            their families. The spies of Stamboul are more efficient as the channels
                            of transmission than as medium for the reception of news. It is said
                            that daily an army of men is sent forth from the Palace to propagate
                            whatever rumor seems at the moment most desirable. By these means the
                            Porte is able to produce any impression it wishes upon the undetonated
                            Moslem of b'ambonl. The Armenian massacres were foreseen long before
                            they took place, but their methodical preparation only preceded the per
                            pentation of the slaughter by some eight which espionage exists in
                            Stambonl is seen in many ways. It has. for instance, often been my
                            fortune to meet and make friends with Turks while travelling only,
                            however, to end the acquaintance abruptly at Constantinople, for it is
                            hardly ever that a Mussulman dare invite or accept an invitation from a
                            foreigner, either to the public restaurant or the privacy of his own
                            house. Stambonl is cankered from end to end with suspicion. There is
                            scarcely any society amongst the dominant race, and it is no
                            exaggeration to say that the city lives under the Shadow of a reign of
                            terror.''</p>

                        <p>A lady resident at Tangiers writes as follows to the "Pall Mall
                            Gazette"</p>
                        <p>More than once I had seen the redoubt- fl able chieftain, " Kaid " Hsmad
                            Aofloos, ^ while, mounted on a superb chestnut barb, he led his fierce
                            Berber cavalry in the j wild rash of a 1 Powder Play" charge. These v
                            performances, which were, by the way, the rj finest exhibitions of the
                            kind which the Pioture City has ever seen, were part of a carefully
                            thought out scheme for terrorizing the loyal portion of this seaport,
                            and inspiring L the mob, still wavering between loyalty and rebellion.'
                            Then came the anti-Jewish riots, followed by the expulsion of some five
                            hundred A or more Hebrews from their homes. The town Governor, the
                            Sultan's own nominee, was powerless before the force at Anfioos's
                            disposal, ^ and had to obey the Berber chieftain's dic­tates to the
                            letter. Meanwhile, the wires were flashing "Revolution in Moroooo !''
                            and the French cruiser was on her way southwards from Tangier) to
                            protect the European population, and was, I am told, to "tarn An-floos
                            out."</p>
                        <p>It was at this critical moment that'—against the advice of more than one
                            old resident—I summoned up courage to ask an audience of Kaid Anfloee.
                            My native page returned with the laoonio message : "Welcome, at ten in
                            the morning." Accompanied by a young French lady and the page, I found
                            my way along the Tl narrow lane known as Agadir "attest" to the town
                            residence of his rebel lordship.</p>
                        <p>We were met in the arched doorway by a singularly conrteons Moor, robed
                            in flowing cream hoed haik, who turned ont to be my Tl lord's
                            lieutenant-governor, or "Khalifa." Es­corted by him, we traversed a
                            rather squalid, white walled yard leading into the stables, where,
                            seated on a big "fertalL" (a ouahion of grass mat, stuffed with straw),
                            lontfced a T thiok-set, heavy man, seemingly more than half asleep. At a
                            word from the Khilifs, the broad, coarse face was slowly raised towards
                            ns. ^ Never in my life have I seen snob a combina­tion of sullen pride,
                            fanatical reserve, and self- satisfied animalism. But the eye&lt;! The
                            word squint is wholly insufficient to describe them. Instead of
                            converging, they each look oat- words in a different direction, their
                            gaz) imparting a horrible confirmation of the im­pression given by the
                            other feature'.</p>
