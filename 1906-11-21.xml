                    <p>ENGINEERS.</p>
                    <p>While the Bagdad Railway still linger, on its way eastward, the fertile delta
                        of the Euphrates is being slowly but surely developed by the Daire Sanich of
                        His Imperial Majesty the Sultan. Large new-areas are being brought under
                        cultivation, tho riverine trade is increasing rapidly, and tho railway, when
                        it readies its goal, will traverse for the last 200 miles of its route a
                        district where much has been done to repair the neglect of centuries. With
                        the opening up of the country to trade and the incrcaao of cultivation, the
                        demand for mechanical appliances of every description is bound to increase,
                        and from news received from what wo believe to be a well-informed source, we
                        gather that there is already a considerable demand for oil pumps at Basra
                        and Bagdad. Hitherto the general want of technical skill has militated
                        against their introduction. It is all very well to introduce machinery, but
                        what if none of tho purchasers are ablo to instal it or to manage it when
                        installed 1 The answer is simple: tho engineering firms must themselves
                        undertake the instruction of the purchasers. They will have to do, not with
                        stupid barbarians, but with a race that possesses many of the best
                        characteristics of the Egyptian, joined to quicker wit. and greater
                        readiness to accept responsibility. And if British engineering firm, with to
                        share in the profita that will certainly accrue to the engineering trade os
                        a whole from tho opening up of Mesopotamia they must set to work themselves
                        to push their machinery and to instruct their clientele how to moke the most
                        advantageous use of their purchases.</p>
                    <p>What is required to ensure success is tho dispatch to the spot of a competent
                        and responsible representative of the British engineering trade. He should
                        virit Mesopotamia in the winter, make local enquiriea, give reliable
                        technical advice, provide estimates, and receive orders. He should be
                        accompanied by a reliable and tactful fitter, who would stay for at least a
                        year os a trial, and who could bn trusted to put up pumps so that they would
                        work at their maximum efficiency, and repair any machines that get out of
                        order. He should also be prepared to give instructions to persons to bo
                        employed in taking charge of pumps. Let a combination of British firms tako
                        this course, and they will have an excellent chanco of securing this market
                        for British machinery. If they wait, the lapse of every month brings with it
                        a greater risk that French or German firms will enter the field. If the home
                        firms are unwilling to try the experiment arc there no British engineering
                        companies in Egypt with the imagination and vigour to tackle the problem 1
                        They will have every assistance from H.B.M.'s Consul at Bagdad.</p>

                    <p>An Antwerp correspondent says that King Leopold's concession to an American
                        company of the cultivation rights on a million hectares of land in the Congo
                        Free State, with ten years' option of purchase at half a million, is
                        considered a clever move on the part of the astute monarch, as by so doing

                        the administration of the Congo State, said that should Belgium fail to take
                        the matter out of the hands of King Leopold, it will became our duty to
                        summon a conference of the signatory Powers to the Treaty of Berlin, for
                        farther enquiry and common action. </p>

                    <p>Replying to a representative deputation regarding the Congo Free State. Sir E
                        Grey said that the Belgian Government had the prior right to intervene. If
                        it did, it would certainly have to make a complete chance in the regime,
                        otherwise Great Britain would sound the Powers with a view to a conference.

                    <p>Budgetary Estimates for 1907</p>
                    <p>According to the report of the Administrator of the Alexandria Municipality
                        on the budgetary estimates for 1907, the latter figure out as follows :—
                        Revenue L.E. 221,000 Expenditure „ 217.3rO Reserve L.E. 3,700 </p>
                    <p>The continual progress of the municipal sources of revenue, says Mr.
                        Chataway,. allows him to foresee for 1907 receipts exceeding by L.E. 26.000
                        those embodied in the Budget of 1906 This satisfactory augmentation is
                        mainly due to increased revenue under the head of the tax on buildings (LE
                        7,80>), the tax on carriages and beasts of burden (L.E. 4,1' 0), the 2%
                        house tax L.E. 2,500;, road dues (L.E. 3.2C0), quarry dues (LE 2,500),
                        abattoir receipts (L E. 2,000;, etc. </p>
                    <p>After referring in detail to the various heads of revenue the Administrator
                        says that the fact matt not be lost sight of that the budgetary equilibrium
                        is only last maintained by the Municipality's present resources, and that if
                        the budget has sensibly increased, it is far from having reached the amount
                        which the needs and charges of the city will shortly necessitate for .the
                        upkeep of all the new works which have already been undertaken, and which
                        the flesh extraordinary resources will allow them to undertake in a more or
                        less early future, for the sanitation, aeration, and embellishment of the
                        town. Chataway Bey adds : — "The creation of a big reserve suggested by me
                        in a previous report is logically dependent on the importance of the excels
                        of receipts over expenditure ; it is then fore materially impossible, unless
                        by a reduction of expenditure—to the detriment of the real needs of our
                        various services—to establish a bigger reserve, so long as fresh resources
                        do no arise to increase the present revenue of the ordinary Budget, the more
                        so as the budgetary estimates of revenue reflect exactly all that we shall
                        be able approximately to euros in 1907, and the amount of which it would be
                        imprudent to raise." </p>
                    <p>As regards expenditure, the estimates are established in such a manner as to
                        ensure the working of the services not only such as tiny had been provided
                        for in 1906 but also according to the situation and with the extension which
                        they have undergone since. The report says that, taking into consideration
                        the obligatory or unforeseen expenditure which the Municipality has to meet
                        with its ordinary resources, and the desire expressed by the Municipal
                        Delegation concerning the inscription on the Budget of 1907 of a reserve
                        more to keeping with the needs of the city, the amount of the grants made
                        annually by the Municipality to the various benevolent societies and other
                        institutions, and which conatitate optional expenditure (less the amount set
                        aside for the free distribution of water to the poor), might be deducted
                        from the ordinary Budget, to be included henceforth in the extraordinary
                        Budget. </p>
                    <p>Chataway Bey adds : "While folly recognizing the useful work done J)y these
                        institutions, I consider it more regular and more in conformity with the
                        regulations and the interests of the administration itself not to take out
                        of the ordinary Budget funds which might be devoted to maintenance and the
                        obligatory expenditure of the city. Io this way the reserve of the ordinary
                        Budget will be brought up to LE. 9,231." </p>

                        Deferred shares the remaining forty per cent. </p>
                    <p>There will be an issue of 298.750 Ordinary shares, payable as follow* :—2s.
                        6d per share on application; 2s. 6d. per share on allotment; and the balance

                        months. </p>
                    <p>The subscription list will be opened on the 10th December, 1906, and closed
                        on or before the 1th December 1906. One-third of the whole issue will be
                        reserved for Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The directors are Major-General Sir John C. Ardagh, K C.M.G.. K C.I.E, C.B.,
                        repre sentative of H.B.M.'s Government on the Board of Administration of the
                        Suez Canal Company; Mr. Elias Meyer, of Meyer Bros , Calcutta. and R Meyer
                        &amp; Co., Singapore; and Mr. Gerald Arthur 8beppard, deputy-chairman of
                        Egyptian Estates, Limited. The advisory board in Egypt consists of Mr. John
                        Hicks Pauli and Neghib J. Sarsock Bey. The Egypt secretary will be Mr. Errol
                        Kerr, C. A., of Messrs.Russell, Kerr and Wyatt, Alexandria and Cairo. </p>
                    <p>The company has been formed especially to carry on business in Egypt and the
                        Sudan. The attention of the Board will, as opportunities present themselves,
                        be more particularly directed .to: The purchase, development and subsequent
                        leasing or re-sale of agricultural and building land ; the lending of money,
                        on mortgage or otherwise, on land or other approved securities ; the
                        carrying on of the business of an investment company. The company will
                        mainly devote itself to the development of selected agricultural estates
                        with a view to their rental or sale to natives in plots suitable to their
                        requirements. The directors consider themselves fortunate in having secured
                        the services of Mr. John Hicks Paoll, as agricultural adviser for a period
                        of three years. Excellent opportunities frequently occur of leading money on
                        first mortgage at good rates and with an ample margin. With a local advisory
                        board composed of business men ot high standing and long experience in Egypt
                        good profits may reasonably be expected from this and other forms of
                        investment which require special local knowledge. </p>
                    <p>The company has acquired from the H. and J. Syndicate, Limited, the right to
                        purchase an estate of 4,793 feddans (say 5 000 English acres), situated some
                        miles south of Alexandria and connected by a line of tramway with the Delta
                        Light Railways system. The estate is a going concern, with ample farm
                        buildings, stock, plant, etc. It his excellent soil and an ample water
                        supply. Mr. Lang Anderson reports that it is "a! property capable of great
                        development at! moderate cost and that if £30,000 be judiciously spent on it
                        during the next five years it can be brought to a capital value of from .
                        £75 to £80 per feddan." He farther adds that "the work of development is
                        simple and follows well-known lines, so that the element I of unforeseen
                        contingencies iB largely diminish- I ed, while the results of development
                        are sure." The present rental value of the estate is nearly £1,000 per
                        annum, derived from an area of under 1,000 feddans let to natives, and Mr.
                        Anderson sees no reason why, when folly developed, the estate should not
                        yield an annual revenue of at least £21,500, whilst its capital value may
                        reasonably be expected to improve by from 70 to 80 per cent </p>
                    <p>The directors have other business in view which is believed to be a most
                        profitable nature ; as, however, negotiations are still in progress, it is
                        not possible to give details at present. </p>
                    <p>All the agricultural properties already acquired as well as those in
                        contemplation have been treated with after personal examination by Mr. Lang
                        Anderson. </p>

                    <head>Jane Hading in Cairo<lb/>"La Princessa Georges"</head>
                    <byline>(From our Theatrical Correspondent)</byline>
                    <p>Jane Hading was all and more than we had hoped to see and hear. She had a
                        perfection of gesture, voice, intonation.—all that the French school has at
                        its highest. In the play given, "La Princesse George" she somehow gave the
                        personality and note of the piece, and yet her own self was at its strength:
                        it was, in fact, the Princess played by Jane Hading, and not Jane Hading
                        alone. submerging all the play. </p>
                    <p>The piece is not profoundly interesting in itself, except for one or two
                        moments of excitement, and of course the revolver incident at the end; it
                        has the touch of discorsiveness and sentimental philosophy or find in Domas
                        fils.. This was marked with the other actors. They are excellent of their
                        kind and play well up to Jane Hading herself; bat the piece, the traditions
                        of—well—elocution, and even the theatre in which they were playing bad their
                        effect. The "asides," for instance, were almost shouted. But the Abbas
                        Theatre is not good for acting, and the voice does not carry well. Jane
                        Hading has to impersonate a woman deceived, and forgiving, again deceived,
                        then resolute, but conquered by her love after all, and then happy in that
                        she has driven out her rival and sent that rival's lover to face the pistol
                        of an infuriated husband ; the prince returns unhurt, and after all not the
                        archdeceiver she feared. Her impersonations was as great as can be imagined.
                        That touch we have spoken of discursive and sentimental, did not appear :
                        every word, every movement, was natural; now passionate, now proud,
                        pleading, forgiving, jealous, condemning, she held the whole theatre. Her
                        influence caught one by the throat, as it were. And what a voice ! We have
                        heard the ultra- correct Theatre d'Orange declamaton. the Opera Cam que
                        elocution, the exaggeration- shriek for certain crises, Mme Granier, the
                        woman of the world. None were quite so perfect and true. Yet we did notice
                        once or twice—always when she was alone on the stage, never when playing
                        with one of the others, Just a touch of forced note. At one moment there was
                        a suspicion of deep tone as of Sarah, and now and again the voice rose high,
                        and the gestare seemed excessive. That may have been the seven days at
                        Alexandria, or the audience of Monday night; one expects it in the Khedivial
                        Theatre ! But her great effect, the tease, harried, passionate whisper, and
                        then at the last that strangled shriek of despair ! How can actresses rant
                        and boom and howl when such wonders can be done by other means ! And again
                        the "voix terne" lifeless and light less when her love gave way before
                        damning proofs : it was all a wonder. </p>
                    <p>We have spoken of the others. The prince was good enough, ai was Galanson,
                        MM. Amaod and Grammont ; and Victor gave the right note of the perfect valet
                        waiting to make money, and repenting a moment ; but his asides j irred
                        greatly. Ha need not have compromised with the theatre acoustics to such an
                        extent. Sylvanie de Terremoode (Laure Sarean) was too theatrical. She might
                        have been Winifred Emery playing a character of Eeto Merriman's, and over
                        accentuating her points. The other ladies were all a little traditional ;
                        and their pronunciation was almost too corrupt. This is not to say that they
                        were not one and all far better than, say, the average Khedivial troupe. </p>
                    <p>The house was not very fall, bat it is a big theatre, and then unless one is
                        well in front it is very difficult to hear properly. The management might
                        perhaps give a little more notice when the curtain is going to rise. We are
                        sure they will ; they are always most courteous and careful. But on Monday
                        night at the beginning of each set there was a certain amount of
                        disturbance. People only just found out that the curtain was op. and had to
                        get to their places while the play was going on. </p>

                        arrived here this morning, but will not enter upon hi official duties until
                        next May, having obtained leave of absence. He intends to return to

                        the Ottoman Empire, would seem to well qualify him to fill the post for

                    <p>"The Aborigines' Friend," (the journal of the Aborigines Protection Society),
                        says</p>
                    <p>Questions were asked in the House of Cumin me in Joly and August last by Sir
                        Henry Cotton and Dr. Rutherford, on behalf of the Society, as to the
                        alarming increase in the quantities and values of Europe an spirits in the
                        Egyptian Sudan, and seeking fuller information on the subject than is
                        furnished by Lord Cromer's annual reports, or by other documents issued in
                        England. The information then promised has not yet been presented to
                        Parliament; but, through the courtesy of Lord Cromer and Sir Reginald
                        Wingate the Governor- General of the Egyptian Sudan, both of whom have
                        lately been visiting England, the Secretary has been supplied by the latter,
                        and by the Financial Secretary for the Sudan, Colonel E.</p>
                    <p>E. Bernard, with some of the details asked for in the House, and with other
                        particulars which are of special interest at present as evidence of the good
                        work that is being done by British administrators in this part of Africa,
                        and might be done elsewhere, in furtherance of the avowed objects of the
                        Conference now assembled in Brussels.</p>
                    <p>The whole of the Sudan, of course, unlike Egypt and other countries
                        stretching down to the North African coast, is within the 'spirituous liquor
                        zone," whose native inhabitants the signatories to the Brussels General Act
                        of 1892 pledged themselves to protect from contamination by European
                        alcohol. Whatever heresies they may have fallen into in other directions,
                        moreover, the Sudanese are for the most part devout followers of the Koran
                        in abstaining from the use of alcohol in all its forms. Herein they differ
                        somewhat from other Mohamedan communities under French or British control in
                        parts of North and West Africa, where contact with the pagans whom they
                        conquered, and subsequently with European intruders, had more or less
                        familiarized them with strong drinks. Consequently Sir Reginald Wingate, on
                        taking over the work commenced by Lord Kitchener, had local prejudice on his
                        side, instead of against him, in the statesmanlike policy he adopted. Nor
                        was he hampered by such "vested interests," political as well as commercial,
                        as hive been too strong for even the most highminded administrators in other
                        portions of the ointment to withstand. It is none the less to Sir Reginald's
                        credit, however, that he has made the best of his opportunities, and has
                        established regulations as regards the liquor traffic which can scarcely
                        fail, if they are duly observed and supplemented when necessary in the same
                        spirit, to be of immense service to the two million or more Sudanese for
                        whose welfare oar country has made itself responsible.</p>
                    <p>The first of these regulations, one of the initial "Sudan Laws" issued almost
                        immediate ly after the present machinery of government had been organised,
                        prohibited all importation of wines, spirits, or other alcoholic liquors,
                        except under yearly license, revocable at any time, and rendering its holder
                        liable to severe penalties in case of its being abused. This was followed in
                        1902 by more precise and stringent rales, based on the experience of the two
                        previous years and necessitate! by the gradual incoming of European trade
                        and traders, of which the principal forbade the sale of any alcoholic
                        "liquors to any native of the Sudan, or any British soldier of the army of
                        occupation who is not an officer." We are assured by those competent to form
                        an opinion that these rules are rigidly enforced; that the Sudan authorities
                        keep close watch over the few persona to whom license to deal in spirits are
                        granted; that they receive daily returns of the quantities of liquor
                        imported and sold, and of the character and nationality of the persons to
                        whom it is supplied for consumption, whether on or off the premises; and
                        that as a result of the care thus taken practically no European liquor
                        whatever is disposed of to natives of the country, whether Mohamedans. who
                        would sin again it their religious obligations by obtaining it, or such
                        pagans as are within reach of the liquor stores, who have stimulants of
                        their own which are cheaper and more to their taste.</p>
                    <p>It is true that there has been a considerable increase in the supply of
                        European liquors to the Sudan within the past few years, so great that it
                        alarmed even Lord Cromer, who, in his Report for 1901, when the quantity was
                        250 tons and its value L.E. 8,400 wrote: 'I have drawn Sir R. Wingat'es
                        attention to the large amount of spirits which seem to have been imported".
                        and again in his Report for 1901, when the quantity was 501 tons and the
                        value LE 119,738, "Sir Reginald Wingate's attention has been drawn to this
                        subject. The sale of liquors in the Sudan should be carefully watched, and
                        if necessary controlled." It was this increase that caused the questions
                        which have been referred to to be asked in the House of Commons shortly
                        before the adjournment in the summer, and Sir Edward Grey promised to call
                        for an explanation from Khartoum or Cairo. It seems pretty certain, however
                        that the growing trade is mainly due to the large number of Greeks.
                        Levantines, Italians. and others who are now temporary visitors or permanent
                        residents in the Sudan in connection with the dock-building. wharf-making
                        road construction, and o her incidents in the commercial development, both
                        on the Nile and onthe Red Sea coast, and between the two lines, which was
                        the main inducement to appropriation of the country by Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>These foreign workmen, like the English garrisons, travellers for sport and
                        so forth, insist on having imported for them such liquors as they fancy, and
                        may have a right to get them. But this is a different matter from the supply
                        of European spirits to the natives. So long as the latter are saved from the
                        poisoning that is plentiful in other parts of Africa, the requirements of
                        the Brussels Conference are justified, and no one else has much ground for
                        complaining.</p>
                    <p>In one respect Sir Reginald Wingate has, at the risk of lessening his
                        popularity with the liquor liking members of the community under him, gone
                        beyond the requirements of the Brussels Conference. Here, as elsewhere, the
                        people not bound by religious scruples are wont to brew their own beers, of
                        diverse tastes and qualities. and less frequently to ferment their own
                        spirit-, and with these native manufactures the Powers assembled at Brussels
                        made no attempt to interfere. The Sirdar, however, evidently with good
                        intent and apparently with beneficial result, has taken a bold course, the
                        working of which will be well worth watching. On 1st July, 1903. he issued
                        an Ordinance 'for regulating the manufacture and sale of native liquors."
                        One sweeping clause directs that "no person shall within the Sudan
                        manufacture any spirituous liquors nor possess or sell any spirituous
                        liquors which have been manufactured in the Sudan under penalty of a fine
                        not exceeding L E. 10 and forfeiture of the apparatus used in the
                        manufacture of the same." Another, dealing with non-spirituous beverages and
                        the parts of the Sudan which have been brought under control, prescribes
                        that "no person shall, within any town in which this ordinance may for the
                        time being be in force, manufacture for sale, keep open any premises for the
                        consumption of merissa or other native alcoholic liquor, except in virtue of
                        a license issued by the licensing authority"; and the licensing regulations
                        that follow are laid down in subsequent clauses as strict and deterrent as
                        they well could be. The example set by this ordinance is one that might be
                        followed with great advantage in some other British possessions and in the
                        possessions of other European Powers represented at the Brussels Conference
                        now sitting.</p>

                    <head>Egyptian Cigarettes.</head>
                    <p>The New York "Sun" says :—</p>
                    <p>"A controversy which has been going on in Europe, and especial y in England,
                        as to the rivalmerits of Turkish and Egyptian cigarettes seems likely to be
                        settled by a report of a disinterested bat observant American Consul.</p>
                    <p>"Though the United States is the great cigarette producing nation of the
                        world, there are imported into this country every year more than S3 000 000
                        worth of foreign made cigarettes, some Turkish and some Egyptian.</p>
                    <p>"Turkey is a large tobacco producing country, yielding 50,000 tons of tobacco
                        every year, and the Turks, it is well known, are a nation of smokers. The
                        amount of tobacco raised in Egypt is inconsiderable, and yet Egyptian
                        cigarettes are imported into this country in considerable amounts every
                        year.</p>
                    <p>"The explanation of the matter, as offered by the American Consul in Athens,
                        is simple. It seems that the Greek tobacco crop last year was the largest
                        Greece ever harvested— about 200,000 000 pounds. A brand of Greek tobacco is
                        used for Egyptian cigarettes.</p>
                    <p>"Why. it is asked, Egyptian! The answer is that Egyptian cigarettes are made
                        by Greeks, because cigarettes paper is too expensive in Greece, where it is
                        a Government monopoly. Thus the business has gone over to Egypt. The most
                        famous cigarette makers of Egypt the hands of Greeks, who import their
                        tobacco from their own country and in taro ship it to foreign countries,
                        England and the United States being the chief market for Egyptian
                        cigarettes, which are in fact, Greek cigarettes, those bearing the title
                        Turkish being imported from Turkey direct."</p>

                    <p/>
                    <p>A glance at the above table clearly shows that although England increased her
                        small turnover by 240% daring the four years, her trade at the end of the
                        period was still nearly 50% below that done by Germany in 1902 whilst the
                        latter country's figures rose from L E. 31,813 to L.E 50,881. Franco has
                        steadily increased her sales since 1902, and although Italy's returns
                        suffered a slight diminution last yea', both countries are still a long way
                        ahead of Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>Vests.— The bulk of the vests sold in this country come from Saxory and the
                        southern parts of Germany. The price for the cheapest qualities runs about
                        12 francs (10/-) the dozen o.i.f. Alexandria. Germany also produces a better
                        class article with fancy designs at 30 francs, 32 francs, and even 40 francs
                        the dozen.</p>
                    <p>We have recently had placed before ns some Dutch vests mads on the borders of
                        Holland and Germany. The sizes ware 34 and 36 inches in width, the length
                        being 26 and 27 inches respectively. When we mention that op to six months
                        ago the goods were sold at from 8 francs (6/8) the dozen o.i.f Alexandria,
                        it will be readily seen that no wool is employed in their manufacture. Owing
                        to the rise in the price of cotton, the vests are now 10 ½ francs (8/3) the
                        dozen. A very low grade article is manufactured by Italy and sold here by
                        weight.</p>
                    <p>Speaking generally, the vests most in favour are those with long sleeves. The
                        material should be fairly elastic, whilst, at the same time, the wrist of
                        the sleeve ought to have a rather tight fit.</p>
                    <p>Men's Drawers.—The trade in this article, so far as the Arab is concerned. is
                        not extensive, since the fellah, as a role, wears an undergarment in the
                        form of a very loose and wide sack with a couple of holes in it. The goods
                        are made from cheap Manchester fabrics, and are worked up by the native
                        women or tailors.</p>
                    <p>Cheap drawers for men have recently been sent over from Holland, the
                        dimensions of the goods being 34 and 36 inches in width, and 41 and 41
                        inches in length. The material used is entirely cotton and the price o.i f.
                        Alexandria about 9 francs (7/1) &amp; dozen. Five per cent, is allowed to
                        the commission agent and a farther 3 % to 5 % for cash within 30 days.</p>
                    <p>Stockings.—A very large business in socks and stockings is done by Germany
                        and France. Although the former country also provides a better class sock,
                        the bulk of her trade consists of a low grade article sold at prices which
                        almost defy competition, viz, about 4 to 5 francs (3/2 to 3/11) the
                        dozen.</p>
                    <p>The above remarks apply to women's stockings, though the material used is
                        rather better than in the case of socks, and the price proportionately
                        higher, say, from 5 to 6 francs (3/11 to 4/9) the dozen. Better qualities
                        run up to 20 francs (16/ ) and even 30 francs the dozen.</p>
                    <p>France dies not lay herse'font to supply the very cheapest form of socks, her
                        prices varying, say, from 6 to 12 francs the dozen.</p>
                    <p>The few woollen socks which are used come from England, though for obvious
                        reasons the output for Egypt in this article can never be anything but
                        small.</p>
                    <p>Black is the principal colour for women's stockings, whilst openwork wear is
                        also much in favour. In socks for men, those hiving horizontal or vertical
                        stripes are the ones most in demand. Coloured sooks also find a market here.
                        One essential feature is that the colours should stand well, and in this
                        respect Germany sets a satisfactory example, even with her cheaper
                        qualities. The sizes sre as follows:—Children 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Women 8,
                        8 ½, 9, and 9 ½. Men 9 ½. 10, 10 ½ and 11. The goods are usually packed in
                        boxes each containing half a dozen pairs.</p>
                    <p>Many travellers—and especially from Germany—come over in connection with the
                        hosiery trade, and to show the volume of business which may be obtained oa
                        this Bide, we may instance the case—which we have on good authority—of a
                        certain Gorman manufacturer who, as the result of a personal trip once a
                        year, usually takes away with him orders for vests and pants to the extent
                        of LE. 5.000.</p>

                    <head>England's Position</head>
                    <p>The reason for Germany's predominance in the trade is undoubtedly to the fact
                        that she caters for the masses, the result being that she produces a
                        low-grade article which is sold at a very cheap price. She is also liberal
                        with her terms, allowing 5 % to the agent and 5 % for cash within 30 days or
                        even longer. On the other hand, it is generally admitted that, excluding the
                        relatively small better class European trade, the English articles are too
                        good for the requirements of Egypt. We must also conf its that, in the
                        course of our investigations, we have met the old story of the refusal of
                        home manufacturers to alter their sizes. Id this connection, one well known
                        firm stated to us that some time ago they obtained samples of ladies'
                        stockings, the sizes and shapes of which, on arrival, were found to be
                        entirely unsuitable for this market. The manufacturers on being asked to
                        make the goods in larger dimensions replied to the effect that they could
                        not alter their standard sizes unless a big line were taken. This was
                        impossible, seeing that the order was merely a trial one.</p>
                    <p>Speaking generally, England easily claims a superiority in all kinds of
                        woollen hosiery, ai d she can also more than hold her own in the best class
                        of lisle thread and cotton goods. She is, however, unable to compete in the
                        lower priced articles.</p>
                    <p>The demand for fancy colours and designs in hosiery does not appear to be
                        catered for at home, this trade being mainly done by France. For example, a
                        prominent outfitter here recently showed us a French sock which he had been
                        totally unable to match in England. The article consisted of a coloured
                        ground with embroidered front, and was, of course, ribbed. Although the
                        seams were badly finished and placed the main one running exactly down the
                        middle of the foot—the sock was being retailed by a competitor at 4/- the
                        pair.</p>
                    <p>Toe ribbed top of an English sock should be thicker and thus more elastic
                        than at present so that it may cling better to the leg. The foreign
                        manufacturer pays more attention to this point than the English house. In
                        the case of women's stockings, the English standard requires to be made
                        rather wider at the top for Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Certain foreigners when in mourning entirely clothe themselves in black, even
                        carrying the practice so far as their braces. The necessary vesta and pants
                        come from the Continent.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a home manufacturer wishing to enter this market, we would
                        suggest that, after getting in touch with a reliable agent, he forwards the
                        latter a small postal order with instructions to buy samples.</p>

                    <head>Meteorology of the Nile Valley.*</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Survey Department, constituted some years ago, is adding largely
                        and rapidly to our knowledge of the hydrography, geology, and meteorology of
                        the Nile basin, The director-general, Captain Lyons. R E., has prepared and
                        issued a monograph dealing vary fully with the physiography of the Nile
                        basin In this wo-k, he combines the results of firmer observers and
                        investigators with the data accumulated during the past ten or twelve years
                        by his department. It is a storehouse of information in relating to that
                        mist remark able, and until recent years most mysterious, of rivers.</p>
                    <p>We propose to give a brief statement, based on the information contained in
                        the monograph, of the more important features of the meteorology of the Nile
                        Valley and their relations to the physiography of the whole area.</p>
                    <p>The river obtains its supplies from two colleting areas, one the equatorial
                        lake plateau, (between lat. 5' S. and lat. 5 N., and long.</p>
                    <p>48" and 35° E.), and the second the Abyssinian mountain and plateau area
                        (between lat.</p>
                    <p>7° N. and 14° N., and long. 35° and 40" E.).</p>
                    <p>The former is the larger catchment basin, and includes the Victoria, Albert
                        Edward and Albert Lakes, which serve as reservoirs to store the rainfall of
                        the whole region. The Victoria Lake (equal in area to Scotland) is about
                        4,000 feet above the sea, and is slightly lower than the mean level of the
                        plateau. The ground rises slightly to the south and east, and rapidly to the
                        west to the elevated peaks of Ruwenzori, which separate it from the rift
                        valley, in which are situated the Albert Edward and Albert Lakes connected
                        by the Semiki River. The catchment area of the Victoria Lake is only of
                        comparatively small extent, not more than twice the area of the lake, the
                        level of which hence varies very slightly with the season. The Victoria
                        Nile, which issues from the north o' the lake, is precipitated over flat,
                        marshy ground to the Choga Lake Swamp, and descends by a series of rapids,
                        and finally by the Murchison Falls, to the lower level of the Albert Lake at
                        its northern extremity in lat. N.</p>
                    <p>The Albert Edward and Albert Lakes, with their tributaries, appear to collect
                        a larger volume of water than the Victoria Lake. Victoria Lake discharges by
                        the Victoria Nile a nearly constant amount, averaging 500 cubic metres per
                        second and the Albert Lake amounts varying between £00 and 1,100 cubic
                        metres per second.</p>
                    <p>The discharge of the lake system is carried off northwards from the Albert
                        Lake by the Bahr el Jebel, or Albert Nile, as it is called by Sir William
                        Willcocks. It descends rapidly from a level of 2300 feet to 1500 feet at
                        Gondokoro (lat 5° N.). in a narrow channel with numerous falls and rapids,
                        and thence to Lake No (lat. 9 ½° N.) through an extensive flat and swampy
                        region. It is joined at Lake No by the Bahr-el-Ghezal, and about eighty
                        miles farther down stream by the Sobat. The former drains a large portion of
                        the Sudan, its head-waters being chiefly in the equatorial belt. The Sobat
                        is formed partly by drainage from the same belt and partly from the southern
                        face of the Abyssinian plateau.</p>
                    <p>Between Lake No and Khartoum, the main stream is now known as the White Nile.
                        The discharge of this river below Lake No varies to a slight extent during
                        the year, and averages only 350 cubic metres per second, and heuc
                        considerably less than the supply passing into tha river from the Albert
                        Lake. The difference represents the loss by evaporation in the extensive
                        swamp region through which these streams flow. That of the Sobat is only
                        considerable daring the rainy season, from April to December, ranging
                        between 380 cubic metres and 1470 cubic metres per second. The White Nile
                        below the junction of the Sobat (lat. 9 ½ N) to Khartoum (lat. 15 ½° N.)
                        receives no affluent, and flows in a broad valley as a wide stream of
                        moderate velocity. This part of the Nile plays a subordinate but important
                        role with respect to the Nile floods. From May to September the flood water
                        brought down by the Sobat River is ponded up or held back in this reach of
                        the Nile, and hence does not contribute to the Lower Nile flood. Captain
                        Lyons states that this action stores op an average of about 1500 million
                        cubic metres from the Sobat flood, which is applied to the Nile in October,
                        November, and December, thus prolonging the period of the Nile flood, and
                        delaying the fall of the Nile to its low water stage. ("Nature").</p>

                    <p>A writer in the "Times of India" gives an interesting account of a visit of
                        the Bombay Mohamedans to their mosques. Standing at sundown opposite the
                        gateway of the building, the spectator witnesses the sight pictured as
                        follows: —</p>
                    <p>Here are the rich, purse proud merchants of Persia, clad in their long black
                        coats; there the full-boarded Maulvais. Behind them come smart sepoys
                        hailing from Northern India, golden turbaned, shrewd eyed Memon traders, and
                        ruddy-complexioned, close-bearded Juts from Multan. Nor is our friend the
                        dark Sidi wanting to the throng; and he is followed by the Arab with his
                        well-known head-gear, by the handsome Afghan, and by the broad- shouldered
                        native of Bokhara in his heavy robes. Mark, too, the hurried steps of the
                        brocade worker from Surat, who grudges this half-hour of daylight stolen
                        from his loom ; and note the contrast of colour as the grimy fitter or
                        blacksmith passes through the porch side by side with the spotlessly clad
                        Konkani Mussulman, whose high features and olive skin betray his Indo-Arab
                        origin. Rich and poor, clean and unclean, all pass in to—prayer. As the
                        concourse increases, the shoes of the Faithful gather in beat s along the
                        inner edge of the porch; only the newer shoes are permitted to lie, sole
                        against sole, close to their owners, each of whom, after washing in the
                        shaded cistern, takes his place in the hindmost line of worshippers.</p>
                    <p>As the service proceeds, the ranks of the congregation kneel, stand, fall
                        prostrate, and press the brow upon the ground with a rhythm so reverential
                        and so dignified that the watcher forgets for a time the torn or tawdry
                        raiment, the grime of the factory, the dust of the streets, and feels that
                        each fresh attitude of devotion is indeed the true posture of prayer. I is
                        as a eea, troubled by the breath of tome unseen spirit—wave upon wave
                        rising, bending, and finally casting itself low in humility a id self
                        sacrifice at tke very footstool of the Most High. But all the worshippers
                        are men. 'Where are the women," you ask; "do they not repeat the daily
                        prayers also" "Verily yes." replies our guide; "they are all praying in
                        their homes at this hour. More regular, more reverent are they than we are;
                        and it we men but prayed as the women pray, no shadow would dim the
                        brightness of Islam."</p>

                    <p>Internal Discontent In Germany.</p>
                    <p>On the eve of the meeting of the Reishstag General von Podbiflski's
                        resignation has been accepted. The Prussian Minister of Agriculture leaves
                        office adorned with the insignia of one of the most illustrious Orders which
                        his Sove reign has to bestow. His retirement will nevertheless be generally
                        regarded as a recognition of the force and authority of public opinion. The
                        late Minister was unpopular with the masses of the German people because of
                        the extreme views upon agricultural protection which he shared with the
                        narrowest and the most conservative of the Prussian Agrarians. His policy
                        has left its mark upon the new treaties of commerce which Germany has been
                        concluding with her neighbors, and at home it is regarded as one of the main
                        causes of the great rise in the cost of meat which is occasioning such
                        widespread discontent in the</p>
                    <p>Fatherland.................................................................. </p>
                    <p>The sacrifice is, no doubt, expedient, bat it will hardly suffice to assuage
                        the general discontent and. uneasiness-t which are said to pervade almost
                        all classes of the German nation. These feelings have their root in causes
                        far wider and deeper than resentment at the conduct of an individual
                        Minister, or even than displeasure at the general conduct of public affairs.
                        They arise not from the mismanagement of those affairs, though with a nation
                        which has its full share of vanity this doubt- leas has helped to influence
                        them, but from the great and growing dissatisfaction that the management of
                        the country should remain exclusively confined to the present, hands. An
                        influential South German newspaper boldly attributes them to what it calls,
                        with some petulance perhaps, a "crisis of absolutism." The phrase is
                        exaggerated, but that it expresses a truth no observers who have watched the
                        growth of modern Germany, and the dove lopment of political thought within
                        her borders, will question. ("TiroFs").</p>

                    <p>Sensitive as they are to fluctuations in international prestige, the subjects
                        of William II. are, at present, more nearly concerned with the prolonged
                        negation of their civic rights. They cast their eyes abroad, and see that
                        the peoples of less intellectual and less progressive countries have a
                        definite voice in the management of their domestic affairs. A Frenchman, an
                        Italian, V1 Austrian, or -Hungarian, even a Bulgarian or Servian, can take
                        his part in the making or unmaking of a Ministry. In Germany, if there is a
                        "Chancellor crisis, ' the electors are but an audience invited to witness a

                    <p>The situation would, perhaps, be considered less intolerable if the only
                        parties concerned were Emperor and Reichstag, King and people. Bat between
                        the Monarch and his subjects stands the Court camarilla, a clique of
                        flatterers and adventurers, whose business it is to prevent the Ruler from
                        ascertaining the mind and thought of the nation. If we may believe the
                        journals—which are, without distinction of party, practically unanimous—the
                        courtiers are only too successful in the arts of mystification. They play
                        alike cn the finer impulses of the Emperor's character and on the lees noble
                        traits—on his generosity, his self reliance, and his vanity. Nihil estquod
                        credere de se Nod possit cum laudatur dis a qua potestas. It is hard,
                        indeed, for an absolute Ruler to ignore adulation and set a limit to his own
                        capacity. ( 'Standard.")</p>

                    <head>Belgium and the Congo.</head>
                    <p>In the course of his speech at the Guildhall banquet on Friday last, the
                        Marquees of Ripon pointed out that the be3t solution of the Congo difficulty
                        lay in the annexation by Belgium of the territories of the Free State, which
                        thenceforward would exist only as a Belgian colony. In that event it may be
                        assumed that Belgium's national pride could not for a moment allow her to
                        countenance the perpetuation of the system with which the rule of her
                        Sovereign in Africa is unhappily associated, if she should decide to take
                        this step and to assume the burden which would thereby be cast upon her, she
                        may be well assured that she will be hampered by no interference on the part
                        of this country. Rather than that she may rely on the energetic sympathy of
                        all persons who have recognized that in this course lies the salvation of
                        the Congo natives. If, however, Belgium should not see her way to undertake
                        this duty, then, as Lord Ripon pointed out on Friday, it will be for this
                        country and the other Powers to consider what concerted action may be taken
                        to enforce the provisions of the Berlin Act of 1885 ("Morning Post.")</p>
                    <p>Adverse Legislation and Investments.</p>
                    <p>The question of safe investments is a very difficult one for men who have no
                        financial experience. In the old days, when Consols were not sufficiently
                        attractive, the professional man and the official with a fixed income had an
                        alternative in mortgages on land, which were thought to be as safe as
                        Consols themselves. But, what with the depreciation of agricultural property
                        and predatory legislation, beginning with Ireland and spreading to the rest
                        of the United Kingdom, the former sense of security has vanished, and it
                        will not be long before testators will forbid their trustees to invest money
                        in land in Great Britain, as they have for years done with regard to
                        Ireland. Under a Government which crouches before the Labour Socialist
                        party, even railway Debentures of the highest class are weakened. There is
                        an old-fashioned complaint that people will invest in risky ventures in
                        foreign countries, and yet refuse to take up promising prospects at home.
                        The explanation, in part at least, is that confidence in the political
                        justice of the country is shaken. Land, breweries, and railways are menaced
                        by adverse legislation, and men with money to invest look out for
                        opportunities in lands where the risks are less obvious. ("Telegraph")
                        British Cotton for British Mills.</p>
                    <p>Of such great national and Imperial importance is the growing of the cotton
                        required for our manufactures within the Empire that no apology is nee led
                        for referring again to the work of the British Cotton Growing Association.
                        The second annual report of the society, which is just issued, is partly
                        encouraging and partly disappointing. The initial loss on working has been
                        greatly reduced, and the council state that they have reason to hope it will
                        be still farther red need next. year, while in 1908 they expect to show an
                        even account and possibly a profit. Such sanguine expectations might be
                        discounted were it not that excellent results have already been shown; and
                        within a not very large number of years the British Cotton Growing
                        Association, and other allied bodies which may bring up in other parts of
                        the Empire, having the same end in view, might quite possibly be able to
                        grow all the cotton required by British manufacturers. That is, if they
                        receive doe measure of support. Patriotism and self-interest alike should
                        induce the Lancashire mill- owners and operatives to take up shares in the
                        Association; but the report before us does not indicate that they are
                        inclined to do much. . . . It is Sincerely to be hoped that the work of the
                        British Cotton Growing Association will be better supported in the future by
                        those whom it was formed to benefit.</p>

                    <head>King Haakon's Visit to England.</head>
                    <p>The first visit to our shores of the first King of modern Norway would in any
                        circumstances have been an interesting and a picturesque event. To find a
                        parallel we must needs go back to the Middle Ages, to the ill-fated Maid of
                        Norway, to the "brave old ballad of Sir Patrick Spen," and the time before
                        the Union of the Crowns, when none of the kingdoms founded by Northmen was
                        as yet a Great Power, and the Norwegian King could boast for a time a rather
                        greater prestige, and even, perhaps, somewhat higher standard of
                        civilization than their cousins of England and Scotland. These
                        reminiscences, lose nothing in appositeness when we remember that modern
                        Norway, in asserting her independence and dissolving the partial union with
                        the Bernadotte dynasty of Sweden, has chosen as her Sovereigns a Danish
                        Prince and an English Princess. Perhaps because Norway has been for so long
                        a nation without a separate crown or a separate history, and because
                        political interests have touched our own so slightly, it is natural that the
                        sentiment of our common origin and our ancient relationship should hold its
                        place in the imagination of the two peoples. (' Tribune.")</p>

                        underneath, it was found that this arch was the forepart of an arched room
                        or shrine, in which was discovered a natural sized Hathor cow, cut out of
                        sand tone and painted, in a perfect state of preservation. This was the
                        great find of the year. It was the first time on record that a shrine
                        containing a god or goddess had been met with intact. A message was at
                        oncedespatched to Cairo, and soldiers were sent to guard it; but before they
                        arrived Mr. Correlly, who was engaged in the work, sat up all night with the
                        charge to protect her from harm. The cow is of the same type as its modern
                        representative, is painted a reddish-brown, with curious black spots in the
                        form of a four-leaved clover, and on both sides of the neck are papyrus
                        flowers and buds. The shrine in which it was found was built of sandstone
                        blocks, covered with stucco, and elaborately painted and sculptured with
                        pictures of Thothmes and Merit Ra and the cow of Hathor. The whole of this
                        shrine was taken down, and carefully transported, together with the cow, to
                        Cairo, where it has been rebuilt in the Cairo Museum. The neck of the cow
                        bears the cartouches of Amenophis II., the son of Thothmess III. of the
                        Eighteenth Dynasty. It is in high relief, showing that it was
                        contemporary.</p>
                    <p>Experts declare this to be the finest; specimen of Egyptian animal sculpture
                        yet found.</p>
                    <p>In an address (read by Mr. Hall) M. Naville, who has been carrying out these
                        excavations, said Deir el Bahari would be a lasting work of the fund of
                        Egypt. It was one of the great attractions, and one of the most striking
                        sights of all the antique remains at Thebes. When they had carried away the
                        two mounds of rubbish on both sides of the ramp, the whole end of the valley
                        at the foot of the majestic cliffs at De;r-el Bahari would be cleared and
                        open, and the visitor crossing from the river would have before his eyes,
                        not a labyrinth of rubbish mounds, but two temples of remarkable design,
                        dedicated to various gods, and chiefly the goddess who was supposed to dwell
                        in the caves of the mountain, and to go down occasionally to the
                        river—Hathor, mistress of the west. One of these temples, the largest, was
                        built by a mighty queen; its pillar had been re-erected, and its ceilings
                        restored by the fund, so as to protect the sculptures.</p>
                    <p>Dr. B P. Grenfell reported finds of literary papyri at Oxyrhynchus far
                        exceeding the discoveries of any previous season. These comprised new odes
                        of Pindar, parts of the lost tragedy of Euripedes on Hypsipyle, parts of a
                        new Greek historian, and of a commentary on the second book of Thuoydides,
                        the second half of the Symposium, and portions of two manuscripts of the
                        Phaedrus of Plato, of the Panegyricus of Isocrates, and the speech of
                        Demosthenes against Bceotos. These manuscripts all belong to the second or
                        third century.</p>
                    <p>Coming to the new Gospel fragment, which was found in one of the later mounds
                        of the town, with papyri of the fourth to the sixth century, Dr. Grenfell
                        said it contained a complete account of a dramatic episode. The scene is at
                        Jerusalem, by the Temple, and the fragment begins with the conclusion of a
                        speech of our Lord to His disciples, exhorting them to avoid the example of
                        the Pharisees, and in solemn words warning them of the penalties which await
                        the evil-doer both in this world and in the t ext. Jesus then takes His
                        disciples With Him inside the Temple to the place of purification, where His
                        presence is challenged by a Pharisee, who reproaches Him for entering the
                        sanctuary without having performed the requisite religious ceremonies of
                        purification. A short dialogue ensues, in which Jesus asks the Pharisee if
                        he is pure, and the Jew answers, recounting the different religions : rites
                        for cleansing purposes which he has observed. To this our Lord delivers an
                        eloquent and crushing reply, contrasting outward with inward purity. In
                        stern accents He recalls the foulness of the pools below the Temple hill,
                        and draws a striking contrast between the outward bathing prescribed by
                        Jewish ritual and the inward cleansing which He and His disciples have
                        received in the waters of eternal life.</p>
                    <p>Controversy, said Dr. Grenfell, would range rather about the framework and
                        the colouring of the vivid picture disclosed by the fragment than about its
                        main subject. The denunciation of the Pharisee? was no stronger than that
                        which occurred, for instance, in Matthew xxiii., 25, and Luke xi, 37. The
                        chief difficulty was in connection with the ceremonial observances of Jewish
                        ritual which, according to the Pharisee, were necessary before entering the
                        Temple it self.</p>
                    <p>Having concluded his address, Dr. Grentell recited the new ode of Pindar, </p>
                    <p>Sir John Evans was elected vice-president in; the place of Lord Grenfell, and
                        the retiring members of the committee were re-elected. On the motion of Sir
                        J. Evans, seconded by Sir Herbert Thompson, a hearty vote of thanks ' was
                        accorded Mr. W. M. Laffan, of New York, for a donation of £1.000 towards the
                        cost of carrying on the excavations at Deir-el-Bahari The report of the
                        treasurer (Mr. H. A. Groeber), which stated that owing to the restriction of
                        the ford's work to Deir-el-Bahari there was for the first time for many
                        years balance on the right side, was unanimously adopted.</p>

                        <head>AN OTTOMAN'S REPLY TO "AL MOAYAD."</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Sir,—As "Al Moayad" has set himself forward to criticize what has been
                            published in the "Egyptian Gazette" by the pen of a high learned man, he
                            can by no means write in any other way.</p>
                        <p>"Al Moayad" aims at seizing every opportunity to prove to the public
                            (Egyptian nation) that he is worthy of the leadership of the Arabic
                            press. He also desires the natives to consider him the 'official" or the
                            "semi official" paper, which defunds them, and interprets their feelings
                            and their inclinations. But it is evidently a difficult position for
                            Sheikh Ali Yousef to fill or even secure, so long as the qualities
                            described by the English writer are inborn with him. And the defect or
                            fault in that is not, really, with Sheikh Ali, but it is with the earth
                            of which he is the plant.</p>
                        <p>Despite all this, we find that 'Al Moayad" is better than many Arabic
                            papers. Its editor-proprietor is, actually, one of those who have had
                            much experience in the changes of the tide of fortunes through the days,
                            that he is apt to exaggerate matters with consideration to circumstances
                            and speak according to the vicissitudes of policy.</p>
                        <p>It rather appears to me that if Sheikh Ali Youssef have succeeded in his
                            attempts towards inducing the founders of the scheme of the 'new
                            "Algarida" to take "Al Moayad" instead of the former, which will shortly
                            be issued under the controllership of Ahmed Bey Lutfy, -nobody can deny
                            that—his wording in the articles of "Kasr El Doubara" would have surely
                            been of another sort. The articles would have indeed been devoid of many
                            cutting expressions and words, which have (more badly impressed on the
                            English then the articles of the English writer have on the Egyptians.
                            Men acquainted with the methods of Arabic composition are sure to
                            understand (realise) the same.</p>
                        <p>I find that the English writer, against whom "Al-Moayad" writes, did not
                            bring in his description of the Egyptian character one tenth of what has
                            and had been compiled and written about the character of this
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>We are sure of the foot that if we cited what had been said by
                            Ibu-Khuldoon and other educationalists, accompanied by our own Opinions,
                            which are the fruit of a long experience, "Al Moayad" will be forced to
                            accede to what has been said by the English writer, like his confrere
                            "Al Minbar," who did it, a few days ago, with respect to an article
                            written by an Englishman in connection with the scheme Of the 'National
                            University." "Al Minbar" had, on that occasion, requested his
                            compatriots to show their ability, capacity of undertaking the scheme by
                            action not by words.</p>
                        <p>But I know perfectly well that the main purpose of "Al-Moayad's" defence
                            that the Egyptians are free from such low traits of character, is to
                            prove their standing and worthiness of representation, as the council of
                            representatives concerns the owner of "Al-Moayad" in a personal point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>The only idea, I believe, that can be expressed with regard to the
                            representation in question is what has been written by 'Al-Minbar's"
                            correspondent in Constantinople, in his last letter.</p>
                        <p>His words run: "It is not proper of Europe to confer each a valuable
                            donation on a whole nation, as it is only a few individuals of that
                            nation who are representing the real life of High civilization. And we
                            can say nothing than to thank "Al Minbar" for his frankness in declaring
                            such useful facts, and we consider it of more benefit than that
                            "moderation" with which "Al-Moayad" every now and then tries to praise
                            himself, so long as snob a ^moderation" largely depends on the will and
                            inclination of its owner.</p>
                        <p>To conclude my epistle, I beg the writer of the two articles published in
                            the "Egyptian Gazette" to excuse "Al-Moayad" for his defence it that
                            way, as the latter wished, as I have already said, to defend, and at the
                            same time to make his defence according to his end*.</p>
                        <p>Taming now to "Al Moayad." I advise its owner as well as the other native
                            papers to encourage the members of this nation to 'work' and leave aside
                            the controversial words and shouts which will neither reap them fruit
                            nor tarn peril out.</p>
                        <p>And the Egyptians will do much better to ably manage one scheme, and one
                            only, which may indicate conspicuously to the world their (Opacity and
                            standing, instead of burdening themselves with thousands of schemes and
                            inaugurations of plans towards that end.— Yours faithfully,</p>

                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
