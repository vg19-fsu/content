                    <head>THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In yesterday's issue we gave the first portion of M. de Guerville's article
                        in the current number of the "Fortnightly Review" on the situation in Egypt.
                        M. de Guerville's conclusions are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>Those who know the real situation in Egypt can easily understand how almost
                        the whole population, with the exception of an insignificant minority, are
                        satisfied and desire no change. It is enough to compare and present state of
                        the countryeven rapidly and superficiallywith that existing in 1882, to
                        perceive the satisfaction of all classes and the greatness of the work
                        achieved by England; and the more profoundly this question is studied, the
                        greater the admiration that must be accorded to Lord Cromer and to all those
                        who during the past twenty-five years have worked under his orders at the
                        regeneration of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The situation of that country in 1882 may be briefly summed up in the
                        following manner.</p>
                    <p>The Government was then in the hands of a band of rebels, at the head of whom
                        was the cowardly and worthless colonel, Arabi. The exchequer was empty;
                        Egypt owed (almost entirely to Europe) nearly five millions sterling. The
                        revenue was insufficient to pay the interest on her debts, or even to meet
                        the expenses of government. The public works were all in such a state of
                        neglect and disuse as to be no longer of any service. Commerce was paralysed
                        and industry at the last gasp. The fellaheen, to whose labour Egypt owes her
                        agricultural wealth, had stopped working, for, left at the mercy of the
                        Pashas, who extorted from them everything possible down to the last
                        farthing, they died of hunger whether they worked or not. </p>
                    <p>If we add that their leaders told the unfortunate people that their suffering
                        all thes privations was solely the fault of the Christian <cb n="6"/> devils
                        who were exacting mountans of gold from Egypt, it is easy to see that
                        fanaticism and poverty combined were helping to make the situation a
                        critical one for Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Let us slip over an entracte of a quarter of a century, during which we may
                        imagine behind the lowered curtain the struggles and numberless
                        difficulties, the antagonism of Europe to overcome, religious fanaticism to
                        be quieted down, the patriotism of the upper classes to be lulled to
                        restthat feeling of hatred, fear, and resentment, cherished by a whole
                        nation against the intruder whom they beheld coming like a conqueror, arms
                        in hand - we can imagine it all. </p>
                    <p>This is now a tale of the past, and on the curtain being raised we behold a
                        transformation so marvellous, so grand, that it is almost incredible.</p>
                    <p>We find Egypt rich and prosperous; a great portion of her debt paid, an
                        admirably adjusted budget; her revenues increasing enormously, regularly
                        every yearand that in the face of large and important public works, works
                        which daily augment the wealth of the country. Agriculture is advancing by
                        leaps and bounds, while commerce and industry develop and increase with a
                        rapidity unparalleled in the history of the world. A well-organised network
                        of railroads, steam navigation, telegraphs, telephones and excellently
                        maintained canals, spread over the country. Schools of every kind have been
                        openedprimary, secondary and higher schools, technical, commercial, and
                        medical schools. The fellah works quietly and happily on his land, and the
                        townsman is growing rich, while business prospers increasingly from one end
                        of the country to the other. From the mouths of the Nile, from Alexandria to
                        the great lakes of Central Africa, all across Egypt, Nubia, and the Sudan,
                        peace and quiet reign everywhere. Andstrange as it may seemall these results
                        have been obtained, not by increasing the taxes, but, on the contrary, by
                        reducing and even in some cases abolishing them all together. </p>
                    <p>In less than twenty-five years England has accomplished all this and much
                        more still. She has effected the marvellous achievement of remaining in
                        Egypt with the unanimous consent of the Powers of Europe, to the great
                        satisfaction of the Egyptians themselves and the foreigners dwelling in
                        Egypt, and finally of living there as a friend, almosts as an ally, of
                        France!</p>
                    <p>Any one who had foretold this situation some years back would have been
                        treated as an idiot or a madman, and it is unlikely that the English
                        themselves ever expected to attain a result as satisfactory and complete as
                        this. </p>
                    <p>Egypt's prosperity is now well known to the world at large. The almost
                        favulous progress she has made from a material point of view is well known,
                        but not so her equally great and still more surprising advance in a moral
                        sense. The honesty of the Government in all its branches, the impartiality
                        with which all abuses have been punished, and finally the honourable example
                        which during five-and-twenty years, the English have set before the
                        Egyptians, have certainly borne good fruit. To be "honest" is no longer an
                        empty expression on the banks of the Nile, and the entire population
                        understands to-day what that word signifies. I think of how absolutely
                        unknown it was in 1882! To sum up, Egypt and the Egyptian have now clean,
                        both physically and morally. We may say that England has cleansed and
                        disinfected them externally and internally.</p>
                    <p>Their whole life has been changed by this, and the change is visible even in
                        their dwellings. Little by little they are altering their habits: sleeping
                        in beds instead of lying on the ground, using forks instead of their
                        fingers, changing their clothes, anda miracle indeed!- allowing there women
                        to catch a faint glimpse of emancipation. Yes, women are being better
                        treated, are freer and happier and their future is beginning to look much
                        less dark.</p>
                    <p>The members of the new generation are physically and mentally much in advance
                        of their elders, but they would be greatly mistaken in considering
                        themselves capable of directing the future destinies of Egypt alone and
                        unaided.</p>
                    <p>Egypt, as I have pointed out elsewhere, is still one of those beautiful and
                        attractive, but terribly delicate plants which cannot stand upright without
                        a prop. This prop, the only one that suits the case, is England, or, rather,
                        it is that excellent man Lord Cromer.</p>

                        <p>The wheat crop in the neighbourhood of Khartoum is a great success. In
                            some localities the yield per feddan is estimated at 12 ardebs. Should
                            this estimate be correct, the wheat cultivation ought to be a lucrative

                    <dateline>LONDON, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>Mr. J.M. Robertson, M.P., asked Sir Edward Grey last night in the House of
                        Commons whether, in view of the fact that the system of conscription at
                        present prevailing in the Egyptian Army, with its exemption from military
                        service by means of purchase, led to the enrolment of unwilling recruits in
                        the army, would not the Government advise the establishment of paid military
                        service?</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in reply to Mr. Robertson, said
                        that Lord Cromer, in the reports which had been cited, had given some
                        reasons why the abolition of the present system of conscription would be
                        inexpedient. The existing conditions in Egypt rendered it impossible to
                        introduce a system similar to that prevailing in the case of the British
                        Army. However, as would be seen in the Report of Lord Cromer, the subject
                        continues to receive attention.</p>

                    <p>A dividend of 6 per cent for the half-year, making 10 per cent., for the
                        year, and a bonus of 8 per cent., together equal to 20s. per share, was
                        recommended in the report presented at the 20th ordinary meeting of this
                        company, held at the offices, 26, Old Broad street this day week. Mr. G. T.
                        Biddulph moved its adoption. Although it did not show a great improvement on
                        last year, whatever changes had taken place were to the good. There had been
                        a great expansion of business in Egypt, and the new companies which had been
                        started had entailed a great deal of speculation in shares. Then, again,
                        there was a great increase of the value of land in Egypt. Last year there
                        were one million cantars more cotton than in the previous year, and in Egypt
                        the producer also sold for cash and not as in England. High priest ruled in
                        September, and the growers consequently took advantage of them. That, he
                        said, was the real reason for the active bullion operations at the end of
                        the year. Lord Milner, who was well known and respected in Egypt through
                        having been some years ago financial secretary to the Khedive, had agreed to
                        become an additional director. </p>
                    <p>Lord Rathmore, who has just returned from Egypt, in seconding, said that the
                        great preponderance of the business now being done in this country was of a
                        sound character and would proceed upon its course, even if there were a few
                        failures of individuals. The development of every kind was extraordinary,
                        especially in the matter of the value of land. The report was adopted.</p>

                    <p>It will be remembered that Erkwit is among the places which the Director of

                        adequate Silvio. Sig. de Marchi's Chnio was as forcible and artistic as
                        ever, though he was not quite in such good voices as on Tuesday. Once more
                        Sigrs. Ber lendi charmed us with her all-embracing voice and convincing
                        acting and took her encore in Act I. with every success. Sig. Costa was
                        again satisfatory, while Sig. Paltrinferi, as Seppe, quite surpassed himself
                        and won much and well-deserved applause.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN AMERICA.<lb/>A LARGE AND GROWING DEMAND.</head>
                    <p>Another instance of the increasing appreciation of the value of Egyptian
                        cotton in various parts of the world is to be found in the successful manner
                        in which these varieties are now competing with American yarn in America
                        itself. Mr. D.C. Roper has presented a report to the Department of Commerce
                        and Labour at Washington on the supply and distribution of cotton, home and
                        foreign grown, in the United States for the year ending August 31 last, and
                        one of the most significant statistics tables accompanying the report is
                        that shwoing the enormous increase since 1890 in the importation of Egyptian
                        cotton for American mills. </p>
                    <p>Only a little over 10,000 500 lb. bales were required at American mills in
                        1890; while by 1906 the quantity imported reached 105,697 bales. From Peru
                        in 1890 only 603 bales of cotton were imported. Last year, the total was
                        6,397 bales. This growing demand for Egyptian and Peruvian cotton is due to
                        its increasing use in the manufacture of yarns for thread and knit goods;
                        and owing to the high price of wool, as a substitute for wool, in the
                        manufacture of woollen goods. As the production of cotton in Egypt is not
                        keeping pace with this growing demand from English and American mills,
                        efforts are being made in the United States and in South America and also in
                        India, to grow a fibre with the same characteristics from seed imported from
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Apparently to prevent the idea from gaining ground that Egyptian cotton is
                        replacing the American grown staple, Mr. Roger explains that "it cannot be
                        considered as an important rival of the upland staple of America, as the
                        greatest demand for it is in the manufacture of fabrics requiring a smooth
                        finish and a silky lustre."</p>
                    <p>The "Times" correspondent at Calcutta states that the Egyptian cotton in Sind
                        has been so seriously ravaged by bollworm that the yield is only fifth of
                        that expected. The quantity is excellent, and high prices have been obtained
                        at auction, the total amount realized being 1 1/2 lakhs (10,000 pounds).

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S NEW HOTEL.<lb/>INAUGURATION TO-MORROW.</head>
                    <p>It is a curious fact that though palatial and luxurious hotels are to be
                        found throughout Egypt and even in the suburbs of Alexandria, the port
                        itself is singularly deficient in similar first-class houses of
                        accomodation. But in the Savoy-Palace Hotel, which opens its doors tomorrow,
                        the public will find a hostelry which will compare most advantageously with
                        the best of those in Cairo and Upper Egypt. It was only some seven months
                        ago that his handsome house in Rosetta street, build some three years since
                        for the late Baron Cumbo, was acquired by the Palace Hotels Company of
                        Egypt, and within that time they have made such additions and structural
                        alterations that now some 130 rooms are ready for immediate occupation. The
                        former handsome facade of the house with its marble balconies and
                        ornamentations have been left practically unaltered; but two great wings
                        have been added at the back and the space between them has been transformed
                        into a lofty and very spacious winter garden with a high glass domed roof,
                        which as a lounge will prove one of the great attractions of the hotel. On
                        the same ground floor and leading from the winter garden are the handsome
                        reading and billiard rooms on the left; and on the right is the fine
                        restaurant, which occupies the entire ground floor of the right wing. This
                        restaurant is of very notable proportions and fine scheme of decoration, its
                        elaborately moulded ceiling is studded with electric lights, and enormous
                        gilt electroliers also spring from the snow-white panels of the walls. A
                        handsome crimson carpet covers the parquet floor, and the high stand of
                        palms in the centre of the room surrounded by the numberless small tables
                        with their dainty fittings give it a delightful air of comfort and
                        well-being. The walls of the winter garden are also of snowy whiteness,
                        palms, and flowers and the pretty coloured cane furniture supplying the
                        requisite relief of colour.</p>
                    <p>On the same floor, but looking out upon Rosetta-street, is the ladies'
                        delightful drawing room daintily furnished in Louis XVI. style with
                        tapestried furniture, mirrors, and pictures, the dominant tone of colour
                        being a restful green. The bar is also situated at the front of the house on
                        the level of the street, and the usual offices of the management, toilette
                        rooms both for ladies and gentlemen, are also on the ground floor. The
                        commissariat department, kitchens, larders, cellars, and so forth are
                        situated downstairs and must be visited to be properly appreciated. The
                        kitchen is an immense place and most practical with its long rows of
                        gleaming copper saucepans and utensils, and its huge stoves, grills, etc.,
                        etc. The cool room occupies one corner of it , an enormous scullery another,
                        while the remaining anlges are devoted, one to patisserie making and the
                        other to coffee. Eight white clad cooks preside over operations here, while
                        a hosts of useful myrmidons await their pleasure and beheats. The score-room
                        is connected with the kitchen and contains a vast supply of stores; and
                        there are no less than four cellars stocked with some 300 different sorts of
                        wines, liqueurs, beer and mineral waters.</p>
                    <p>A handsome marble staircase leads from the entrance hall to the floors above,
                        the lift being situated close beside it. The bedrooms, which are fine, lofty
                        apartments, are furnished from the store rooms of either Maple &amp; Co. of
                        London fame or Krieger of Paris. There are some six private suites on the
                        various floors situated at the corners of the house, each suite containing a
                        fine double-bedded room bay window, a dainty salon, and most commodious
                        bathrooms. Many of the smaller rooms have bathrooms attached; and many in
                        the front of the house have balconies. The less expensive rooms are at the
                        back of the house, but are equally convenient and are furnished with the
                        same attention to detail and comfort. Various other staircases in addition
                        to the chief one lead to the upper floors, the roof space being devoted to
                        the model linen rooms, laundry and ironing rooms, and other offices.</p>
                    <p>The managing director of the Palace Hotels Co. is Mr. Springer, whose
                        Egyptian experience is of long standing and to whose energy and capacity the
                        success of many of our hotels is due. His present connection with "Al
                        Hayat," Helouan, is well known, and to it may be attributed the fact that
                        this sanatorium is the finest and best ordered in the East. The manager of
                        the Savoy Palace is Mr. Auber, who has been Mr. Springer's right hand for
                        many years, and who is eminently capable of making this new hotel a great
                        success.</p>
                    <p>As before remarked, the doors of the Savoy Hotel are to be opened to the
                        public tomorrow; and already rooms have been booked in advance. There will
                        be a reception during the afternoo, when a most complete and well stocked
                        buffet will be found in the winter garden; and in the evening a banquet will
                        be given to the directors and those who are connected with the management. </p>
                    <p>There are rumours of other hotels to be erected shortly in Alexandria, but we
                        can safely assert that they will find it difficult to provide better comfort
                        or accomodation that what are now obtainable at the Savoy Palace.</p>
                    <p>By kind permission of Lieut.-Colonel Chapman and officers, the band of the
                        1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers will play the following programme of music
                        tomorrow:-</p>

                    <head>SAVOY HOTEL.<lb/>ANNUAL FANCY DRESS BALL.</head>
                    <p>There was a huge crowd at the Savoy on Tuesday night, and naturally a great
                        number of the pretty conceits in dress which had been worn at Ghezireh last
                        week made a second appearance. There were also a good number of people who
                        preferred paying the fine to donning the motley, and in fact the greater
                        proportion of the men present were in conventional attire. But it was a most
                        successful ball nevertheless; and perhaps the gay frocks of the ladies were
                        all the more noticeable among the more sombre clothes of the men. Miss
                        Hemming never looked bettern than on this occasion when she was attired as a
                        Snowflake, her short frock of shimmering silver being rightly flocked with
                        snowflakes and with a few touches of scarlet-berried holly about the
                        decolletage. Mrs. Wilson, too, could not have happened on a happier costume
                        than that inspired by the period of 1830. Her straight frock of satin just
                        falling to her ankles displayed her heelless sandelled shoes, her hair was
                        piled in masses of curls at the top of her head, and decorated by a waving
                        mass of paradise plumes, while across her shoulders she wore the regulation
                        scarf so beloved by the heroines of the day. Miss Fox was wearing a
                        delightful tiny blue silk Directoire coat with long tails over a lace frock,
                        her big blue bonnet bearing many feathers and bands of velvet. Lady Vivian
                        made a very beautiful Marie Antoinette in black velvet with black feathers
                        and chiffon in her powdered hair; and Miss de Bilinski was a most effective
                        Margarite de Valois in black with beautiful lace, a small black velvet
                        capote outlined with pearls upon her head with a long white veil hanging
                        from it. Miss Blythe was a good represntation of a Gibson girl with scarce a
                        variation to her ordinary toilette, while two splendid poppy dresses were
                        worn by Mrs. Ridgen and Miss Felix Brown. Miss Birkett as a Danish lady of
                        1820 wore a curious straight and somewhat narrow tunic of crimson velvet
                        over a handsome brocade underdress, with an ornate cap of velvet to match.
                        Miss O. Soames was in a white Greek dress, the draperies confined by bands
                        of pearl embroidery and with many rows of pearls threaded through her hair.
                        Mrs. Nolan was quite lovely as a Circassian lady, the lower half of her face
                        lightly veiled with a transparent chiffon; and Miss Moore looked extremely
                        well in a black carnival dress outlined with bands of blue. Miss Grafton as
                        Monte Carlo bore upon her frock all the symbols dear to the heart of the
                        gambler, and Miss Carey was again attired as a Toreador, the big velvet hat,
                        many gold ornaments and scarlet touches being especially becoming to her
                        dark beauty. Miss Bullock made a most effective Carnival in scarlet, while
                        the two Misses Cole were dainty milkmaids. Mr. Sacher, made a great
                        sensation on his appearance in domino and yashmak, and Mr. Randolph Berens
                        wore a most handsome and effective Court dress with blue satin coat and
                        tricorne hat and many ruffles at wrist and neck. Mr. Whitworth Jones was an
                        awe-inspiring sheikh. Capt. Adams, in checks of abnormal size, belonged to
                        the sporting fraternity of bookies. Mr. G. Bennett made a very gallant
                        courtier in wig and silken garments, embroidered waistcoat and ruffles, and
                        the three soldiers of the Indian army were magnificent in their economies
                        turbans, etc. </p>
                    <p>Amongst others we noticed the Count and Countess Hollnstein, the latter
                        wonderfully gowned as usual, the Earl and Countess of Carnavrou, the
                        Countess being in black. Lady Clark, wearing a magnificent dog collar of
                        diamonds; Lady Bartlett, Major General and Mrs. Bullock, Mr. and Miss

                        Bennett in a Greek costume, the two Misses Wahn, one as Carmen and one in

                                the Hook of Holland, has been wrecked off the Hook. 141 persons have
                                been drowned, including 91 passengers. (Reuter).</p>

                            <p>The Berlin was trying to enter the harbour when she was driven on the
                                northern jetty and broke in two. The forepart sank. The passengers
                                and crew gathered on the aft portion, which drifted on to a
                                sandbank, and were washed off. Among the drowned was Mr. Arthur
                                Herbert, King's Messenger, and 19 members of the chorus of the
                                German opera company which had just finished the season at Covent
                                Garden.</p>
                            <p>The lifeboat made repeated futile endeavours to reach the Berlin.
                                Captain Parkinson, of the Hold Line, who was a passenger, is the
                                sole survivor. He says he has never seen such a sight. When the
                                vessel broke up he seized a piece of timber. The shrieks around him
                                were terrible. He remained for an hour in the icy water constantly
                                striking against corpses till he was picked up by a lifeboat. The
                                majority of the dead are German, Dutch, and Belgians. Mr. Herbert
                                bore despatches for the Courts of St. Petersburg and Teheran.

                    <head>EDUCATION IN EGYPT</head>
                    <head>A SUGGESTED EDUCATION TAX.</head>
                    <p>While there can unfortunately, says the "Globe," be no doubt that native
                        unrest is still rite in Egypt, there are many who look for its removal in
                        the spread of popular education. We sympathise with this feeling, although
                        we cannot altogether share its optimism. Education is not a universal
                        panacea that cures all diseases; and its success in India has not been as
                        great as its promoters hoped. It it has not removed sedition in Asia, it
                        will probably not do more in Africa, although experience may teach us to
                        avoid certain mistakes in Egypt that were unwittingly made in India. However
                        that may be, it can be taken as axiomatic that the educational system of
                        Egypt will be improved and extended as soon as the Government is able to
                        afford the expense. At present it is a question of ways and means. The
                        suggestion has been made in England that the foreign bondholders should
                        provide the funds, but this is obviously untenable. If it had not been
                        capital, Egypt could not have emerged from bankruptcy to her present
                        material prosperity: and to mulct the bondholders would simply mean that
                        they would be penalised for their good deeds. The immediate effect on the
                        bonds would be disastrous, and no future loan that it may be necessary to
                        issue would have any chance of being subscribed. The honest course is
                        evident. If the people are able to bear it, a small education tax should be
                        imposed in Egypt itself.</p>

                    <p>"Senex" sends the following to the "Spectator":- -A few days ago I received a
                        letter from a young relative who is in the servicec of the Egyptian
                        Government. He writes from some place on the White Nile. "The Sirdar
                        honoured this district with a visit on the 11th, and told me that he was
                        very pleased with what he had seen. We certainly gave him a great reception.
                        Some ten thousand yelling natives- many mounted on camels, others on most
                        beautiful horses- certainly made an imposing sight. I led the three hundred
                        horsemen of our own neighbourhood at the gallop, armed with a long spear,
                        right up to the dais on which the Sirdar was standing." A year or so ago
                        this young fellow was working for the Oriental Languages School at Oxford. I
                        have no wish to exaggerate the importance of such things, but they give me a
                        comforting conviction that our race is not by any means "played out."</p>

                        <p>Sir,- I hope the Egyptian Government will follow the rule in force on the
                            London Stock Exchange in its new Bourse regulations whereby every member
                            of the Stock Exchange, however long may have been his connection with
                            the House, has to formally apply every year for re-election. The system
                            has advantages for by its means a complete directory of Stock Exchange
                            members is compiled from the returns which have to be sent in every
                            March by each member. The forms of application are placed round the
                            markets, in boxes provided for the purposes, and the applicant has to
                            state his private and business addresses, his bankers, telephone number,
                            partner, and whether he carries on business as a broker or a jobber. The
                            member further has to declare the he is "not engaged as principal or
                            clerk in any business other than that of the Stock Exchange, nor is my

                        <dateline>Larnaca, February 8.</dateline>
                        <p>On Tuesday, the 5th, his Excellency the High Commissioner opened the
                            first session of the newly elected Legislative Council. The procedure
                            followed the usual lines and occupied only some 20 minutes. The Election
                            petitions are still before the Courts, and it remains to be seen whether
                            any chcanges in the composition of the Council will be made as a result
                            of the judicial proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The matters of principal interest referred to in the opening speech
                            were:-</p>
                        <p>That the railwayis receiving a very fair share of popular support, and
                            that it is possible that before long further extension may take
                            place.</p>
                        <p>That a scheme for improving the landing arrangements at Larnaca,
                            estimated to cost 31,500 pounds, has received the approval of the Home
                            Government; also that a project for the improvement of the port of
                            Papho, at an estimated cost of 12,500 pounds, is under consideration,
                            and may later on be submitted to the Legislative Council.</p>
                        <p>Some small increases in the salaries of certain officials are
                            foreshadowed, and proposals for a somewhat more liberal provision for
                            the assistance of the Agricultural Department are also to be
                            submitted.</p>
                        <p>His Excellency holds that the financial position of the country is
                            improving and that it is at the present time more sound and more full of
                            hopeful promise than it has been in modern times.</p>

                        <head>FESTIVITIES IN NICOSIA.</head>
                        <p>The week preceding Lent has been full of festivities in Nicosia. For some
                            time past a large company numbering over 40 persons had been busy
                            rehearsing. "The Geisha, and on the 6th and 7th instant we had the
                            pleasure of witnessing the performances in the Papadopoulos Theatre,
                            Nicosia. It may be at once be said that the success was complete both
                            from the artistic and financial standpoints. The receipts for the two
                            nights, including one liberal donation, amounted to about 60 pounds- far
                            more than has been taken on similar previous occasions, and, after all
                            expenses are paid, a sum of about 10 pounds is likely to be handed over
                            to the Island Hospital Fund.</p>
                        <p>Many difficulties had to be overcome since the project was first started
                            on Troodos last summer; not the least serious being the withdrawal at
                            almost the last moment of the principal actor and actress through
                            illness. Much sympathy has been felt for the latter who has been very
                            dangerously ill and still gives cause for much anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile the choruses and lyrics, with which the play abounds, were
                            steadily practised and within a fortnight of the date of the performance
                            there appeared on the scene a lady who very kindly undertook the
                            uninviting task of evolving order out of chaos. As if by a magic touch,
                            or rather by skilful and most efficient coaching, aided by a very
                            thorough acquaintance with the play, this lady appears to have quickly
                            imparted life and action to the performers, and the latter working with
                            a hearty good will, smooth water was soon attained. The whole caste
                            seems to have worked con amore, and although the claims upon the leisure
                            time of some of the busier members of the company must have been
                            exacting, they were loyally met. The house on each night was crowded
                            with enthusiastic audiences, the leading songs were encored, bouquets
                            were showered on the stage, and at the close the principals were called
                            before the curtain. There was not a dull moment in the play, and a word
                            of special praise is due to the four principal geisha, who both looked
                            most charming and did their songs and dances with remarkable precision
                            and grace. </p>
                        <p>His Excellency was unfortunately precented by indisposition from
                            attending the first performance but gave general satisfaction by being
                            present on the second night.</p>
                        <p>After the performance on the 7th nearly all the company and several other
                            friends were invited to supper at the house of Mr. Rees Davies, who had
                            been partly instrumental in carrying the whole thing through. A
                            presentation was then made to the two ladies who had been responsible
                            for the acting and staging and the music, and to whose untiring efforts
                            the undoubted success was mainly due.</p>

                    <head>DR. WIlLIAMS' PINK PILLS</head>
                    <p>"I'm always 'on the go' from morning till night," said Mrs. Wright, of 26,
                        Quay-street, Manchester, greatly respected by travellers and theatrical
                        companies as a kindly landlady. "But," she continued, 'twelve months ago I
                        overtaxed my strength, and a severe illness followed- the development of
                        which threatened to be even more serious. Fortunately, I turned to Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People for a cure, and I have them to thank
                        for the good health I can now boast of.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Wright, "if you had seen me then you would not have
                        recognised me. I was a complete wreck, languid, run down, and without an
                        atom of energy. At the same time I caught a severe cold, and in my weak
                        state it played havoc with my constitution. I suffered from headaches, and
                        the pains across my eyes and foreheard were so severe at times that I could
                        not lift my head. If I did I became dizzy, and a sickly sensation would
                        overcome me. My tongue was thickly coated, and my limbs seemed to drag like
                        lumps of lead.</p>
                    <p>"Going upstairs I became exhausted and breathless long before reaching the
                        top, with sharp stabbing pains in my chest and back. Then I had to stop,
                        panting until I could regain breath. My nerves were completely unstrung ; I
                        seemed to have</p>
                    <p>No Control over My Hands</p>
                    <p>and they trembled violently. During long sleepless nights my illness preyed
                        upon my mind, and in the morning I felt more tired than at bedtime. I was so
                        terribly weak I could only just crawl out of bed; sometimes it took me hours
                        to dress.</p>
                    <p>"Things went from bad to worse, and I felt more dead than alive. I had no
                        appetitie and was restless and irritable. I tried all sorts of medicine in
                        my endeabour to get better, but without the slightest good. Day by day aI
                        lost weight until I became</p>
                    <p>Terribly Weak and Reduced</p>
                    <p>"When I was beginning to despair of things ever mending one of my visitors
                        remarked, Why don't you try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills?" So I then and
                        there-decided to give these pills a trial. After taking them for some time
                        my hopes were raised, for I could enjoy food without fear of indigestion.
                        Thus encouraged, I continued with Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, and each dose
                        seemed to bring back my lost energy. So I steadily improved until now I am
                        no longer troubled with headaches ; I sleep well at night, and wake in the
                        morning refreshed and ready for my day's work. My nerves are strong, and I
                        seem to be endowed with</p>
                    <p>New Strength and Energy</p>
                    <p>I am now 65 years of age, strong, hearty, and can get about much better than
                        most women of my age. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills put new blood into m veins,
                        and saved me months of suffering."</p>

                    <p>LES DROITS DE LA FEMME ET LES STATUTS</p>
                    <p>Une Dame, devenue proprietaire, par voie d'heritage, d'un certain nombre
                        d'actions d'une societe anonyme en Allemagne, voulut prendre par a
                        l'Assemblee Generale de cette Societe, mais elle n'y fut point admise, la
                        Societe lui mais opposant une disposition des Statuts qui ne prmettait
                        l'acces aux Assemblees qu'aux personnes du sexe masculin.</p>
                    <p>La Dame, consciente de ses droits, considera cette disposition comme
                        arbitraire et injuste. Elle resolut donc d'actionner en justice la Societe
                        dont les reglements fondamentaux portaient un si grave prejudice a ses
                        interets. Le Tribunal la debouta. Elle interjeta appel, mais en vain:
                        l'appel confirma le premier judgement.</p>
                    <p>La Dame ne se tint pas pour battue, elle porta son cas devant la Cour Supreme
                        qui reconnut enfin la justesse de ses reclamations et declara nul l'article
                        des Statuts qui niait au sexe faible l'admission aux Assemblees, article
                        qu'elle considerait a juste titre, comme contraire a l'espirit de la fameuse
                        loi de 1900, qui accordait aux femmes les memes droits qu'aux hommes pour la
                        gestion de leur fortune.</p>

                    <p>A part de rares exceptions, c'est toujours la faiblesse qui prevant. Comme
                        hier, l'ouverture a ete un vraie debandade; plus tard on s'est un peu
                        ressaisi, mais on n'en cloture pas moins a un niveau generalement inferieur
                        a celui de la veille.</p>
                    <p>Ce sont la Levico, l'Arditi, la Nile Land, les Estates et les Building Lands
                        qui ont desfraye la plupart des transactions.</p>
                    <p>Apres avoir debute a 1 9/32, la Levico finit a 1 1/4; en sens inverse
                        l'Arditi, apres un mauvais debut, s'ameliore a 1 7/32. La Lunghis s'inscrit
                        a 1 1/4 et les Ritz a 1 29/32.</p>
                    <p>La Ramleh reprend a 6 3/16 et la Nile Land s'avance a 24.</p>
                    <p>De 2 3/8 ou ils etaient tombes au commencement de la seance, les Estates
                        remontent peu a peu a 2 1/2 en cloture.</p>
                    <p>En revanche, nombre de valeurs sont en reaction: l'Agricole tombe a 9 3/4, la
                        National Bank a 27 3/4, la Delta Light a 11 7/16, la Cassa di Sconto
                        nouvelle a 264, le Comptoir a 7 3/8 et l'Union Fonciere a 6.</p>
                    <p>Inutille de dire qu'aux prix actuels le plupart de ces valeurs sont a
                        recommander comme placement, surtout l'Agricole et l'Union Fonciere.</p>

                    <p>Ici, le marche a presente, ce matin, le meme aspect desempare qu'hier, avec
                        accentuation de la tendance a la reaction sur les valeurs qui ont ete
                        traitees. Aux causes speciales que nous avons deja exposees il faut ajouter
                        l'approche de fin de mois qui provoque des liquidations hatives, par crainte
                        de plus bas prix, ce qui pese lourdement sur les cours. Heuresement, la
                        crise semble, de chef meme, avoir atteint son apoges, et, grace a une
                        position de place allegee, une reprise pourrait aisement se produire, plus
                        vite qu'on ne le pense. Toujours est-il que c'est la premiere fois, par
                        suite de la veritable decauche d'emissions d'affaires nouvelles a laquelle
                        nous assistons, que l'on a vu un tel dessarroi se produire en Bourse juste
                        en la periode la plus favorable de la saison active, a la veille du paiement
                        des coupons, a la fin de la campagne cotonniere et au retour habituel de
                        l'aisance monetaire. Toutes les esperances basees sur une annee
                        exceptionellement prospere ont ete ainsi decues par suite de l'effrayant
                        drainage d'argent opere sans interruption depuis le mois de Novembre dernier
                        et qui m enace de se prolonger en Mars et en Avril, a moins que les
                        souscripteurs, deslussiones <!-- Unclear -->, ne se montrent decidement

                        Banque d'Orient a 133-134 et la part Societe Generale Egyptienne a 93.</p>

                        a 213-214. L'Epargne a faibli a 3 et sa part a 202. L'Express Nile a cloture
                        a 5 1/2 l'action ancienne et 5 1/4 la nouvelle; la part a termine a 275. </p>

                        alourdis a 4 5/16 et les Upper Egypt a 4 5/8-11/16. La part de fondateur

                        Abdy se sont raffermis a 1 3/16 1/4. Les New Egyptian ont flechi a 28 sh.,

                    <p>"The Egyptian Gazette" d'hier attire l'attention sur un nouveau flot
                        d'emissions qui menace le marche egyptien. Les nouvelles Societes dont on a
                        deja annonce la formation ne constitueraient qu'une petite fraction en
                        comparaison de celles qui sont sur le point de naitre tant a Londres que sur
                        place. La "Gazette" ajoute que les promoteurs de ces nouvelles Societes
                        paraissent resoluls a ne pas attendre, a lancer coute que coute leur affaire
                        dans le cours de cette saison.</p>
                    <p>Nous aimons a croire que la "Gazette" exagere. Dans le cas contraire, etant
                        donne l'etat du marche, il serait peut-etre opportun de songer a la creation
                        d'une ligne ou plutot a la construction d'une digue contre une nouvelle
                        inondadtion de titres qui pourrait serieusement aggraver la crise
                        actuelle.</p>

                        nouvelle suivant laquelle un droit de preemption aurait ete exerce a
