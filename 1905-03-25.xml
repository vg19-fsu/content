                    <head>THE SINEWS OF WAR</head>
                    <p>A Reuter's telegram from St. Petersburg of yesterday's date states that among
                        the banters, there the belief is very general that the Tsar will be
                        compelled by force of circum stances, if not induced by his Ministers, to
                        discontinue the war. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most
                        important, and likewise the most satisfactory, piece cf news that has come
                        over the wires for a l^ng time. It is the outcome of the French reply to the
                        declared intention of the Tsar and the Court party to pursue the war, quant
                        mime: And the French reply is one that does not easily admit of any
                        effectual rejoinder from St. Petersburg. If Russia is to go on fighting she
                        must have money. Where is money to come from f Not, assuredly, from London
                        or from New York t From Berlin, then 1 Not much. The friendship of the
                        German Codlin, unlike that of the French Short, is based upon strictly
                        business foundations : "Do ut dee." There will be no four hundred millions,
                        or any appreciable fraction thereof, to be had from the haute finance of
                        Berlin. Russia, then, if she is to j continue the war, must find herself
                        confronted, | sooner or later, with the choice between two
                        alternatives—repudiation or ruin. How soon the choice will have to be m»de
                        nobody can say for certain, unless it be M. Witte. Perhaps Mr. Lacien Wolf
                        took too despondent a view of the situation when he assumed, in a recent
                        issue of the "Times," that Russia's net annual] deceit "cannot be less than
                        150,000,000 rubles a year, and is probably a great deal more." But there can
                        be no doubt that there is a deficit, and that Russia's frequent foreign
                        loans have been due "almost exclusively to the deficiency of national
                        income." If that has been the state of things in time of peace, what else
                        but ruin or repudiation can come of persistence in a war waged upon the most
                        gigantic scale the world has ever seen ? As to repudiation, that is an act
                        from which a great Power would, surely, shrink with the reluctance of an
                        honorable man. The Russian coupons have always been paid—even if out of
                        money lent by the very people who have presented them for payment; and we
                        cannot believe that anything like wholesale repudiation of her liabilities
                        will be resorted to by Russia If, however, that dishonorable and disastrous
                        consummation is to be avoided, the cataract of her present expenditure must
                        be promptly dammed, which can only be done by admitting the relentless logic
                        of facts, accepting the penalties of defeat, and making the beet terms she
                        may with an enemy who too strong for her. Every day's delay not only
                        increases Russia's own liabilities, but enhances the moral right of Japan to
                        Tecoup herself for the tremendous sacrifices which have been the price of
                        victory. Every day, too, the magnitude of the disaster at Mukden becomes
                        more an t more apparent. Quite two-thirds of Kuropatkii. s host has been
                        annihilated, and the remnant cannot possibly be relied up in even to save
                        itself from total extinction at Harbin, which, Reuter says to-day, Russian
                        correspondent? consider will be untenable unless 20u,iX)0 reinforcements are
                        sent immediately. [Since the above was written a telegram has reached us
                        from Paris stating that the committee of the Stock Exchange officially
                        announces that the Russian loan negotiations have been resumed now and are
                        proceeding quite satisfactorily. The conclusion of the loan, however, has
                        yet to come.</p>

                        <p>General Maximovitch, the new Governor General, has arrived. He attended
                            mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral, such action being unprecedented
                            since 1831. He called upon the Archbishop and requested the support of
                            the Catholic clergy in restoring order. His friendly action is regarded
                            as an indication that the Government in St. Petersburg intends to be
                            more conciliatory towards Poland. (R.)</p>

                    <dateline>Port Said, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>As announced in my telegram of this morning, the third squadron of the Baltic
                        Fleet, under the command of Admiral Negobatoff, reached here this morning at
                        dawn. The first vessel to enter the harbour was the flagship "Emperor
                        Nicolai 1st," at 5-50 a.m. She was followed by the battleships "General
                        Admiral Graf Apraksin," "Admiral Senyavin," "Admiral Oushakoff," the
                        armoured cruiser "Vladimir Monomakh," the tugboat "Svir," and the transport
                        ships "Kouronia," "Zenia," and "Graf Stroganoff."</p>
                    <p>The flagship "Emperor Nicholai 1st" is a steel-sheathed battleship with
                        composite hull, was built in 1889, and has a displacement of 9,700 tons. She
                        is armed with two 12-in. guns, four 9-in., eight 6-in., and 18 various, and
                        she has six torpedo tubes which are all above water. Her speed is 14
                        knots.</p>
                    <p>The "Admiral Oushakoff" and "Admiral Senyavin" were built in 1893 and 1894
                        respecttively and both have a displacement of 4,126 tons and carry four
                        6-in. guns, four 9-in., and 22 various. They have four torpedo tubes above
                        water.</p>
                    <p>The "General Admiral Apraksin" is of the same type as the two former vessels
                        and was built in 1895, but differs from them in carrying three 10 in. guns
                        and four 6-in. The speed of all these battleships is nominally 14 knots.</p>
                    <p>The armoured cruiser "Vladimir Monomakh" is a vessel of the same type as the
                        "Dimitri Donski" and was built in 1881, but her machinery and guns were
                        renewed in 1897. Her displacement is 6,000 tons and she carries five 6-in.
                        guns, six 4-in., and 20 various, and has three torpedo tubes above water.
                        One of he peculiar features of this vessel is that she only has a normal
                        coal accommodation of 400 tons. Her main mast has been cut away to within 20
                        ft. of the deck and she carries a searchlight on it. She is constructed of
                        wood and copper sheathed with thin iron plating topsides. Her guns are
                        unprotected and she is certainly the most unwarlike and unsea-
                        worthy-looking man-of-war that I have ever een. As an instance of her
                        seagoing qualities, I might mention that I observed that her sides are badly
                        dented and much worn, whilst several pieces of her deckwork are greatly
                        damaged, evidently by heavy weather.</p>
                    <p>Of the other ships, the "Svir" is a tugboat ailing under the mercantile flag
                        and with a partly naval crew. These are characteristics of all the so-called
                        "transports" too. The "Kourania" is a very old passenger ship and has a very
                        small mixed crew: I could only count 14 deck hands and I noticed 5 persons
                        on deck who to all appearances were passengers. The "Zenia" is the only real
                        transport -hip amongst them, and she is called transport No. 342. On her
                        deck I could only count a crew of ten. "The Graf Stroganoff" can be
                        described as a moderately good oil-tank vessel and is the only vessel of the
                        squadron which is not fitted with the latest Marconi installation. The
                        hospital ship, "Kostroma" which, as I have already informed your readers,
                        arrived here yesterday morning, was built in 1888 and belongs to the
                        Volunteer Fleet.</p>
                    <p>The vessels Have been allowed to take in water and a certain quantity of
                        provisions, but none of them have been allowed to ake coal, with the
                        exception of the hospital-ship, which took 250 tons of coal yesterday
                        afternoon. The police allowed no boats to approach the squadron whilst they
                        were coming in, but their efforts to keep the small boats away were greatly
                        relaxed when all the vessels were at anchor. The squadron will leave at dawn
                        to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>(BY TELEGRAPH).</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Saturday. The hospital-ship "Kostroma" left yesterday evening and
                        will continue to Djibouti in advance of the squadron. The rest of the fleet
                        entered the Canal between 5 and 6.30 this morning.</p>
                    <p>All traffic in the Canal has been stopped and the canal is strongly guarded
                        by special patrols of police and coastguards.</p>

                    <p>Early yesterday afternoon the Viennese choral society arrived by special
                        train at Cairo from Alexandria and were received on their arrival by the
                        leading members of the Austrian community. Herr von Halm, the Austro-
                        Hungarian Consul, greeted them in the name of the Austrian community with a
                        very pretty little speech, and was followed by M. Moise Cattaui, in the name
                        of the Austrian benevolent society, and M. Joseph Cattaui in the name of the
                        Cercle Artistique. The president of the committee of the choral society
                        replied both in French and German in a neat speech, in which he particularly
                        mentioned the warmth of the reception given to the society at Alexandria.
                        Sir Rudolph vou Slatin Pasha was then presented to the members of the
                        society, by whom he was loudly cheered.</p>

                        state that, owing probably to an oversight, we were not favoured with a

                        TEMPLE.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <dateline>Suez, March 23.</dateline>
                    <p> Professor Flinders Petrie, the great Egyptologist, who for some time past
                        has been systematically exploring the Sinaitic Peninsula, returned to Suez
                        yesterday and has left for Cairo. His discoveries in Sinai have been most
                        interesting, and one of his finds is of unique interest and will cause
                        considerable excitement throughout the archæological world.</p>
                    <p>The discovery consists of a Semitic temple in a wonderful state of
                        preservation. It is situated about forty miles to the north of Sinai and is
                        evidently anterior to the foundation of Islam. It is the most perfect
                        Semitic temple that has yet been discovered. So perfect is its state of
                        preservation that the ablution basins are quite intact. It is evident that
                        the persons who designed and built the temple must have been well acquainted
                        with the details of the Temple of King Solomon at Jerusalem, for many of the
                        architectural features of this temple show that, whoever was responsible for
                        its architecture, used the temple of Solomon as a type.</p>
                    <p>Professor Petrie has also discovered some valuable memorials of the ancient
                        rulers of Egypt in the neighbourhood of the old mines in the peninsula of
                        Sinai. It was evidently a custom to make a representation of the King who
                        worked the mine, and one is the portrait of a Pharaoh with unmistakable
                        Sudanese features. The origin of the dynasty to which he belonged has been
                        hitherto one of the great mysteries of Egyptology, and we may now infer that
                        it was Ethiopian owing to this find of the Professor.</p>
                    <p>Professor Petrie and his wife are making a short stay at Cairo before
                        proceeding to Alexandria, where they will embark on a steamer of the
                        Khedivial Mail Line next week for the Piræus.</p>

                    <p>Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr has returned to Cairo from his tenth expedition into the
                        Fayoum desert, and has found that at one period the ancient lake Kurun
                        formed a series or line of smaller oases or lakes to the north-west of the
                        present lake and distant from ten to twenty miles from the present
                        border.</p>
                    <p>On a long ridge of high ground between, and at the edge of these depressions,
                        he found there had been a row of ancient settlements or villages, denoted by
                        corn-grinders, crushing stones, and mealing plates, which have this week
                        been placed in the Cairo Museum, near the jewel-room.</p>
                    <p>Scattered around, and probably of the same period, perhaps neolithic (a
                        period which lasted many thousands of years and of which the commencement
                        dates back hundreds of thousands of years), were flint implements of the
                        unique Fayoum types. This is probably the locality whence the Bedouins
                        derived the arrowheads and other implements they offered for sale, now
                        becoming scarce.</p>

                    <head>DEATH OF JULES VERNE.</head>
                    <p>M. Jules Verne is dead.</p>
                    <p>PARIS, March 24. (Reuter:)</p>
                    <p>Jules Verne, the popular French writer, was born at Nantes, Feb. 8, 1828, and
                        was educated in his native town, afterwards studying law in Paris. Turning
                        his attention to dramatic literature, he wrote a comedy in verse entitled
                        "Les Pailles Rompues," which was performed at the Gymnase in 1850. This was
                        followed by "Onze Jours de Siège," a three-act comedy, brought out at the
                        Vaudeville, and "l'Oncle d'Amérique," and by several comic operas. But his
                        fame rests chiefly on his scientific romances, the first of which appeared
                        in 1863, under the title of "Cinq Semaines en Ballon." Its success led the
                        author to produce many similar works, numbering upwards of 70, of which the
                        following have been translated into English and other languages, even into
                        Japanese and Arabic: "Five Weeks in a Balloon: a Voyage of Exploration and

                        the students that were alleged to have taken place, and its outspokenness
                        made it at first sight highly improbable that his Highness had ever

                        the one given at Ghezireh Palace Hotel on Thursday night. Although many
                        people think that the Cairo season is over, Ghezireh Palace was overcrowded,
                        partly with residents and officers and partly with the visitors staying at

                        band during dinner and afterwards for the dance. The restaurant was quite a

                        Khedivial Mail Line aurait fait en Belgique une émission d'obligations. Nous
                        sommes en mesure d'annoncer que cette nouvelle est dénuée de tout
                        fondement.</p>
                    <p>L'investment est très ferme à 2 7/16 acheteurs et les Estates à 13/8
                        acheteurs également. Au Caire les remisiers, ayant constaté que leur nombre
                        va en augmentant chaque jour, ont décidé la fondation d'une association des
                        remisiers; l'assemblée constitutive s'est tenue jeudi soir ; elle a élu un
                        comité dont M. Maurice Schaar a été nommé président. Cette nomination a été
                        accueillie avec joie à la Bourse.</p>

                    <p>The summer season is approaching and work is decreasing in the offices. It is
                        proposed to abolish all afternoon business on the Stock Exchange. These
                        half-holidays will give many people the leisure to apply themselves to the
                        study of languages, such as English, Italian, Arabic, German, etc. Let us
                        remind those who have forgotten that the Berlitz School addresses are 26,
                        Rue Eglise Copte, Alexandria, and 1, Sharia Kamel, Cairo, where lessons in
                        all tongues can be obtained. 25651-1</p>

                    <p>A very successful Gymkhana was held on Friday afternoon at Mena House in
                        delightful weather, before a large and interested attendance, which included
                        Prince Leopold of Battenberg, Prince Cantacuzene, Baron Oppen- heim, Gen.
                        Sir Augustus and Lady Hemming, Sir John and Lady Maxwell, Countess Lamin,
                        Gen. Count von Bernewitz, Mr. and Mrs. Scott- Dalgleish, Mr. Rees, Major and

                    <p>The races were well filled on the whole and the Apple Race, Saddling-up Race,
                        and Postillion Race were much appreciated. The first event was bare-backed
                        donkey race won by Mr. Langley, with Capt. the Hon. C. James second, while
                        the open donkey race for gentlemen and ladies, in which the ladies were
                        given a start of 7 yards, was won by Miss Marshall, Mr. Padovanni being the
                        first gentleman to complete the course. In the third race there were four
                        entries and Miss Warnock and Mr. Langley got first prize, Mr. and Mrs.
                        Crawley being second. The Apple Race was very popular, there being 9
                        entries, and once again Mr. Langley was successful, Capt. Davis winning the
                        second prize. The Hack Race came next, and Mr. Cotton Fox won after a good
                        finish from a field of five, Mr. Fanshawe being a length behind. The tea
                        interval followed and the tea provided proved another attraction to all who
                        were present.</p>
                    <p>After the interval came five more races. Mrs. Crawley won the Ladies' Donkey
                        Race, Mrs. Canard being second. The Postillion Race brought out a field of
                        10 and Mr. Moberly just won from Mr. Miller. The Maiden Pony Race was won
                        pretty easily by Mr. A. J. Michaelides, Capt. Davies and Mr. Miller being
                        second and third respectively; Mr. Michaelides and Capt. Davies were first
                        and second in the Trial Plate out of a field of 7, and Lady Hemming won the
                        Ladies' Horse Race, which was followed by a race in which the Mena House
                        donkey boys took part. Altogether a very successful afternoon's sport.</p>
