                    <p>In this volume Mr. Phillpotts has torn himself from his beloved Dartmoor, but
                        not from the inhabitants thereof whom he knows so well. Here are fourteen
                        short stories with plenty of local colour-pages of description, sometimes
                        well done, at other times not so well. Before the background of scenery—
                        French, Egyptian, Italian, or Grand Canary, as the case may be-move figures
                        which possess foreigh names but bear a striking resemblance to the heroes of
                        Devon we are accustomed to meet in the pages of this writer.</p>
                    <p>A strong, straight man; a weak, shifty man; a sweet maiden. Many a time and
                        oft has Mr Phillpotts shown how great are the changes he can ring on the
                        collocation of these characters. He introduces them once again, this time
                        with no great measure of success. The stories are entertaining and readable,
                        but with an exception, in no sense distinguished; Mr. Phillpottd does better
                        on a large than a small canvas. We do not deny that he has written good
                        short stories. The volame called "Knock at a Venture" contained several
                        delighful specimens. But they were made delightful by the rustuc humour of
                        the Western counties where their plots were laid. In the present case the
                        tales are mostly serious, and when not serious they have a serious
                        foundations. We never laugh over them, and with difficulty raise a
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>Though he is a rather monotonous writer so far as theme is concerned, Mr.
                        Phillpotts is various in his quality. He will produce a story which comes
                        near to justifying the name "masterpiece," which would be indeed a
                        masterpiece if his touch were a little finer. The next volume from his pen
                        will be as likely as not melodrama of poor quality—sensation conveyed with
                        no very skillful hand.</p>
                    <p>As with the larger books, so with this collection of stories. Some are
                        unworthy of such ability as Mr. Phillpotts possesses. Others have a gleam of
                        poetry or truth which raises them to a high level. They are not short
                        stories of the best kind, but they possess merit.</p>
                    <p>We mentioned an exception. To our mind, the best tale of the bundle is that
                        entitles "Souvenir de Maupassant." Mr. Phillpotts is temerarious in thus
                        reminding his readers of the exquisitely gifted Frenchman. Nor can he be
                        said to justify his deed. But the pathetic story of a Kabyle girl,
                        "Sand-daisy," with its touches of detail and its fine emissions, its
                        plentitude of suggestion and lack of emphasis, is a pretty piece of work.
                        The girl is a wild young creature, romantic-hearted, who tells her dreams of
                        the future to the Traveller. It is not a prosperous life she longs for, not
                        a life in a land flowing with milk and honey. She looks forward to marrying
                        a robber—a man who takes what he wants, not a town-bred wretch piling coin
                        on coin—and to sharing his hazardous existence in the free air. Her father
                        arranges a marriage for her with the wealthy vine grower whom she loathes.
                        The Traveller bent on departure comes with a present for her in his hand. He
                        meets the father, who tells him Sand-daisy's fate:-</p>
                    <p>"It has pleased Omar Mefsaud, the vine grower, to look with favour on my
                        child and he has purchased her with many francs and has given me this house
                        for my own for ever. He has five wives, but three begin fast to grow old,
                        and my daughter has warmd his heart. He is a very great man, and cares
                        nothing that we are only Kabyle. He is so great that he can laugh at the
                        laws and ordinances of his people. And he will wed her next week and she
                        will be the joy of his idle hours; and presently she will give over weeping,
                        for she is a fool and loves him not. Yet, when she has seen the abode of his
                        women, and the riches of looking glass and pictures, carpets and furniture
                        from France that fill it, she will surely dry her tears, and don silk and
                        golden ornaments, and rejoice to do Omar's pleasure, and bless her old
                        father when she rises up and when she sleeps."</p>
                    <p>"He peeped at me out of his mean, inscrutable eyes; then he turned to an
                        orange tree that stood beside the wall</p>
                    <p>"Twice as many francs as there are fruits upon my tree. He has said it; and I
                        have counted four hundred and twelve To-morrow he will come and count.</p>
                    <p>"I left my gift and went slowly down the hill. Above the Djurdjura was lifted
                        that spear of the Lesser Atlas mountains she had loved and the snow upon it
                        still rose upward like a golden cloud egainst the blue. Beyond—invisible,
                        vast an burning—lay the desert of her dreams." </p>
                    <p>There we get a sense of the irony of mortal dreams, of the conquest of
                        romance by the world which reckons the riches of life in figures. The story
                        must be reckoned among the best Mr. Phillpotts has written. Unfortunately it
                        stands by itself within these covers. None of the others can match it or
                        indeed persuade us of their worthiness to companion it</p>

                        <p>The scarcity of meat on the Khartoum markets is attributed to the
                            exportation of the large numbers of sheep to the North, presumably to
                            Egypt. A resident of Omdurman writing to the "Sudan Times" about this
                            matter, urges that measures be taken to stop the further export of sheep
                            from the Sudan. The country, he says, has not had sufficient time during
                            the past nine years of good Government to resuscitate from the baneful
                            influences of the Dervish regime, which reduced the live stock of the
                            country to one twenty-fourth of what it was in ante-dervish days.</p>

                        considering his dignity was offended, went and told his father, who at once
                        went to the Palace and reported to the Sultan. The result was that he
                        immediately got an iradé forbidding all Ottoman subjects from frequenting
                        the cursed club of the Giaours. The Governor and chief of police of the
                        island were dismissed, and orders were given to the Minister of Police to
                        set a close watch over the club in particular and the island in general.
                        Turkish women were forbidden to be out of doors after six o' clock, and a
                        steam launch was put on to patrol the island at night. Everything in the way
                        of a meeting is stopped where Ottoman subjects are concerned, and any excuse
                        does to stop a gathering.</p>
                    <p>Another iradé has appeared forbidding Turkish women to go up the Sweet Waters
                        of Asia and Europe. This excursion was always a feature of the Bosphorus on
                        Fridays and Sundays, these two rivers being thronged with hundreds of boats
                        and caiques, and it was the only outing and form of amusement which Turkish
                        ladies had, of which the poor things are now deprived.</p>

                    <head>SUDAN LAND REGISTRATION.</head>
                    <p>In a letter to the "Sudan Times" Mr. Said Maluf discusses the subject of land
                        registration as an ultimate guarantee of proprietorship. It is only valid as
                        far as the mutual relations between purchaser and seller are concerned, but
                        does not affect the rights or claims of other persons to the property
                        involved. It is the duty of the purchaser, he believes, and not of the
                        Registry Office to ascertain the genuineness of the ownership of property by
                        the seller, and if the buyer is not sufficiently circumspect, he risks his
                        money, and it would be his own fault.</p>
                    <p>The writer suggests as a possible solution to this question, that every
                        person who proposes to sell a tract of land or similar property, should
                        accompany the petition, which is generally presented on such occasions, with
                        copies of documents that establish his proprietorship, and a full
                        description of the property &amp;c. &amp;c. and have a notice to this effect
                        posted in the locality where the property exists, another copy posted at the
                        registry office, and copies sent to the omdehs or sheikhs of the place. A
                        certain period of time should be given during which claims against said
                        property must be presented, otherwise they will not be considered. Such a
                        plan, he believes, will minimize the possibility of attempting fraudulent
                        sales, and will give chance to those who have any claims against the
                        property to present them in time.</p>

                    <head>COTTON SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>The raw cotton year ends says the "Globe" on the 31st inst., and Lancashire
                        will find herself with a rather larger supply than a year ago. During the 12
                        months an increasing consumption has been experienced, and if the American
                        crop this season had been no larger than in 1906, we should have material
                        famine. It remains to be seen what will be the new American yield which will
                        be delivered commencing on the <date when="1907-09-01">1st September</date>.
                        Present appearances denote an output less than in the current season, but
                        really all is uncertainty, as so much depends on the weather for a few
                        months yet. Some authorities venture to say the crop, if good weather be
                        vouchshafed, will be as large as any previous yield, which is, perhaps,
                        saying a good deal. The Egyptian prospects are very good, most authorities
                        in Alexandria believing that the crop will be actually larger than last
                        year. Then the East Indian yield will be a large one, as_the rains have been
                        unusually heavy. Lancashire spinners are taking very little notice of the
                        high-flown language used as to securing large supplies of cotton from
                        Northern Nigeria in the immediate future.</p>

                    <p>A bull Bonte-Bok, Damaliscus pygargus, (new to the collection). This

                        staterooms is the provision of daylight for each room, all the rooms having
                        access to the ship's side.</p>
                    <p>Another noteworthy feature is that the two inner rooms of each block may be
                        readily transformed into a large and commodious apartment for the use of a
                        family party.</p>
                    <p>The first class dining saloon is situated in the bridge deck, and extends
                        almost the full width of the ship. It is lit by large cottage windows on
                        three sides, and also by a lofty dome on the centre, carried up to the top
                        of the upper promenade deck and surmounted by a handsome teak skylight. The
                        ceiling is in raised Tynecastle, decorated in white and gold. The walls are
                        treated in Austrian oak framing, with quarter panels, having relief
                        ornaments of garlands, medallions, and trophies, finished in dull English
                        gold. The music room, on the promenade deck, has a height of nine feet and
                        its walls are finished in the Adams style, with small paintings in the
                        Bartolozzi style in the medaillions. The ceiling is done in special canvas,
                        with relief ornaments. The dome is elaborately decorated, and is finished in
                        white and gold. The first class smoking-room situated at the after end of
                        the promenade deck, is a spacious and airy apartment with a large teak
                        skylight above the centre. Aft of the smoking room there is a large
                        comfortable open-air lounge, protected from the weather on 3 sides.
                        Accommodation for second class passengers is provided under the poop deck,
                        in a style but little different from the first class rooms. The dining
                        saloon, smoke-room, entrance hall, and music room are quite as comfortable,
                        if not as ornate as those of the first "class."</p>

                    <p>The cereal merchants of the Rod-el-Farag Sahel have submitted a petition to
                        the Ministry of the Interior complaining that the frequent passage of the
                        tramcars by the Sahel causes them great inconvenience as it interrupts the
                        landing of their goods and their transport to the depots. The petitioners
                        demand that the line may be transferred from its present position.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of the Interior after examining the matter carefully, proved
                        that the complaint of the merchants was well founded and therefore
                        transmitted the petition to the Ministry of Public Works, which has written
                        to the Tramway Company demanding that the line be transferred to the road
                        behind the depots. The Company is said to have no objection to the transfer

                        F.R.I.B.A. VI.</head>
                    <p>I must begin with an apology for an error in my last article where the word
                        "Moslem" is given for "Muslim," i.e. foreman or teacher of his trade. In
                        Architecture, I know neither Moslem nor Christian; they are equally my
                        friends if they work well and honestly in unison with me in the realisation
                        of my designs.</p>
                    <p>I must but glance at the remaining points essential to good bye-laws as
                        enumerated in the fourth article of this series, the next in order
                        being.</p>
                    <p>DANGEROUS STRUCTURES.</p>
                    <p>During this year, many houses have collapsed in Cairo and Alexandria. A
                        number between sixty and seventy would not be an exaggeration. This is a
                        serious matter involving much danger to the lives of at least a thousand
                        inmates.</p>
                    <p>The London Building Act contains stringent clauses as to dangerous and
                        neglected structures. The District Surveyors of London are constantly on the
                        watch for them. A crack in a wall is often under observation for many
                        months. In cases of imminent danger summary powers are given to the Country
                        Council to pull down, or repair, or otherwise make a dangerous structure
                        safe, the fees for so doing being collected from the owner or tenant as the
                        case may require.</p>
                    <p>Allusion has already been made to the inefficient shoring or propping which
                        may often be seen in Egyptian work. There is also a great danger in the
                        light and flimsy scaffolding so common in Alexandria. On all these points
                        the regulations should be clear and definite as regards strength and
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>TEMPORARY STRUCTURES.</p>
                    <p>It is open to question whether there is a town in the world with more
                        temporary structures in it than Alexandria. Building in this town is
                        temporary in the highest degree. There seems to be a fear of solid
                        substantial work; the material mostly used, Mex stone and soft brick is, in
                        itself, but a temporary building material. There is a woeful lack of
                        enthusiasm in the matter of building; there is no love of making the town
                        beautiful and strong for the sake of the town, as was the case in Vicenza,
                        Verona, Venice, Florence, Athens, etc. But temporary structures are often
                        necessary and need careful building and supervision. In London a license has
                        to be obtained for a temporary building and it is renewed yearly until some
                        reason appears for its withdrawal and the removal of the structure. In this
                        case plans have to be submitted to the Superintending Architect of the
                        Council and copies have to be sent to the neighbours on either side, of the
                        site of the proposed temporary structures; if either or both, object, for a
                        valid reason, to the presence of a temporary structure, the Council refuses
                        permission to build.</p>
                    <p>To make Alexandria permanent instead of temporary is a fine aim for the
                        Municipality; good, broadminded building-laws will help greatly towards this
                        end.</p>
                    <p>DANGEROUS BUSINESSES AND FACTORIES.</p>
                    <p>As towns increase in population the businesses that have any element of
                        danger in them are moved further afield. The Tanzim has, I believe, a
                        regulation with regard to the erection of machinery and factory premises. If
                        it could also regulate gaming and other undesirable businesses (which often
                        do not require special premises) out of existance it would do much towards
                        the needful purifying of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>DUTIES OF SUPERINTENDING ARCHITECT, CHIEF ENGINEER AND BUILDING
                        INSPECTOR.</p>
                    <p>In Alexandria there is no Superintending Architect, the whole of the duties
                        being undertaken by the Chief Engineer. In London the Superintending
                        Architect has practically the whole of the Building Act to administer with a
                        great volume of work beside. He is called the Superintending Architect of
                        Metropolitan Buildings. There is also a Chief Engineer whose business it is
                        to engineer the vastest system of sewerage in the world and design all
                        engineering works proper, such as bridges, tramways etc. An Architect
                        working in unison with the Chief Engineer would doubtless be an acquisition
                        to the city of Alexandria, having special regard to the development of the
                        town towards the sea.<lb/> (To be continued.)</p>

                        <head>CRICKET. <lb/>SHIPPING v. BANKS. <lb/>MCLEAN'S BRILLIANT PLAY.</head>
                        <p>The return match between teams representing the shipping firms and banks
                            of Alexandria was played on the ground of the Alexandria Cricket Club
                            yesterday afternoon, and resulted in a second win to the shipping team,
                            which passed the total of the banks with three wickets still to fall.
                            For this McLean was to be thanked, as, after taking six of the banks'
                            wickets, he compiled the excellent total of <measure>112</measure> and
                            carried his bat.</p>
                        <p>The banks opened their innings with Sampson and Roll, but after the
                            former had scored five his wicket was displaced by Hobsbaum. Clarke then
                            partnered Roll and remained nearly a quarter of an hour for 10, at which
                            total his middle stump was dislodged by McLean. With Marsden and Roll
                            together a splendid stand was made, but when the latter had reached 22
                            McLean disturbed his off stump. Jessop's wicket then fell for a single
                            and the remainder of the batsmen were all dismissed for single figures,
                            with the exception of Roll, who compiled 57 by thorough all round the
                            wicket play, only 28 of which were scored by boundaries. The bowling was
                            shared by Hobsbaum and McLean, the former taking four wickets and the
                            latter, as previously reported, six.</p>
                        <p>The innings of the shipping team was opened by Harkness and Belton, both
                            of whom shaped well, but after a short stay at the wickets Harkness
                            found himself undecided how to play a slow short pitcher from Jessop
                            which consequently passed his bat and made acquaintance with the off.
                            wicket. Spurgeon followed but was almost immediately deserted by Belton,
                            and the wielding of the willow was then assumed, and for the rest of the
                            innings maintained in a most brilliant manner, by the captain of the
                            team, McLean. Playing with the greatest freedom McLean treated much of
                            the bowling with contempt and found the boundary time after time, though
                            he showed considerable care in playing Marsden. The way in which he
                            pulled many of Marsden's deliveries to leg was splendid, while to the
                            bowling of Jessop and Sampson he opened his shoulders and smote with all
                            his might. His total of 112 not out was compiled in less than an hour
                            and consisted of 3 sixes, 18 fours, 4 twos, and 14 singles. At the
                            commencement, of the innings the shipping team looked like losing and it
                            was only by Mclean's brilliant play that the side were able to claim a
                            victory. With the first wicket down for 9, the second for 15, and the
                            third for 19, things looked black against a total of 141, but MoLean,
                            who showed considerable judgment in monopolising the bowling, brought
                            the fourth wicket total to 87. For the fifth wicket 25 were added, the
                            fall of the sixth saw the score at 89, when the seventh fell the board
                            registered 109, and 38 was added for the eight wicket, after the fall of
                            which the total remained unchanged. Eight wickets were taken by Marsden,
                            who was very difficult to play, and the remaining two by Jessop, who
                            unfortunately dislocated his kneecap with the score at 89. On his
                            retirement he was replaced by Sampson, whose bowling however, was
                            treated with scant courtesy.</p>

                        ~loquemment pendant la semaine: écoulée, a été ici moins que brillante. Au
                        début, l'indéci- sion que |'élévation du taux de l'escompte a Londres nous
                        avait value la semaine précé- dente, s'est. rapidement changée en. taiblesse
                        devant les efforts du parti baissier et aussi 4 la suite des ventes de
                        quelques capitalistes timorés. Malgré ce concours de faits défavo- rables,
                        le marché a supérieurement résisté et la baisse n'a pu faire perdre 4 nos
                        valeurs qu'une partie de l'avance qu'elles avaient acquise quelque temps
                        auparavant. <lb/>"On revient actuellement a une apprécia- tion plus saine de
                        la situation et l'on comprend qu'une élévation méme plus forte des taux
                        descompte européens ne pent avoir nne trés yrande influence sur le marché

                        anu milieu de la débandade des meilleurs titres sur les places de Londres et
                        de Paris. On pense mémé, et l'on a de bonnes raisons pour cela, que les
                        achats de placement, un moment enrayés par la peur, vont reprendre aussi

                            <p>Mr. Birrell intimated that the Government deplored the Lords'
                                amendments to the Evicted Tenants Bill but yielded to superior force

                                because they wished to see trouble in Ireland during the coming
                                winter. Irishmen must make the movement sufficiently menacing to
                                obtain reform. Mr. Balfour denounced Mr. Redmond's incitement to
                                disorder. The Nationalists withdrew in a body, refusing to
                                participate in the discussion on the amendments. (Reuter)</p>

                                enter the Government service as teachers. He declined to make

                                had already caused the officials in Egypt extra laborious work.

                    <head>EGYPT OF TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>The following article written last month by Mr Frank G. Carpenter appears in
                        the "Pittsburg Dispatch" :—</p>
                    <p>I am again in the great seaport of the Valley of the Nile. My first visit to
                        it was 25 years ago, just before Arabi Pasha started the rebellion which
                        threw Egypt into the hands of the English. I saw it again seven years later,
                        on my way around the world, and I find now a new city, which has risen up
                        and swallowed those of the past.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria of to-day stands upon the site of the greatest of the
                        commercial centres of antiquity, but its present buildings fare as young as
                        those of New York, Chicago or Boston. It is one of the boom towns of the Old
                        World, and it has all grown up within 100 years. When George Washington was
                        President it was little more than a village. It has now more than 400,000
                        people, and it will soon reach half a million.</p>
                    <p>Alexandria is a city with all modern improvements. It has wide streets as
                        well paved as those of Washington. It has public squares which will compare
                            favorably<cb n="3"/> with many in Europe, and buildings which would be
                        an ornament to any town on our continent. It is now a city of street cars
                        and automobiles. Its citizens walk or ride to its theatres by the light of
                        electricity, and its rich men gamble by reading the ticker in its stock
                        exchange. It is a town of big hotels, gay cafes and palaces galore. In
                        addition to the <measure>300,000</measure> Mohammedans, there are more than
                            <measure>100,000</measure> Christian Europeans now living in it and
                        among them some of the smartest business men of the Mediterranean Sea. The
                        city has become commercial, money making and fortune hunting. The rise and
                        fall of stocks, the boom in real estate and the modern methods of getting
                        something for nothing are its chief subjects of conversation, and the whole
                        population is after the elusive piastre and the Egyptian pound as earnestly
                        as the American is chasing the nickel and the dollar.</p>
                    <div type="item">
                        <head>Alexandria's New Harbor.</head>
                        <p>It is easy to see where Alexandria's wealth comes from. It is growing fat
                            from the trade of the Nile valley. It is the water gate to Egypt and the
                            Sudan, and every cent's worth of goods that goes in and out has to pay
                            toll. More than four thousand ships enter this port every year, and
                            there are now vessels in the harbor from nearly every part of the world.
                            I came to Egypt from Malta on a ship bound to India and Australia, and I
                            can get a steamer any week which within fifteen days will take me to New
                            York. The German lines are making a specialty of Egyptian passengers and
                            freight, and they are gradually capturing the bulk of the Mediterranean
                            commerce.</p>
                        <p>Alexandria has one of the best harbors on the Mediterranean. The port has
                            been improved within the past few years until its arrangements for
                            loading and unloading goods are unsurpassed. It has a break-water two
                            miles in length and the biggest ocean steamers can come right up to the
                            quay. There are 2,500 acres of water in which ships can have a safe
                            anchorage, and many vessels come here to coal. The most of the coal is
                            brought from England and left until the ships need it. Something like
                            12,000,000 tons were thus handled last year, many of the steamers on
                            their way into and out from the Suez canal stop at Alexandria for
                            fuel.</p>
                        <p>I do not know how much the harbor has cost, save that it runs high into
                            the millions of dollars. When Mehamet Ali made Alexandria his capital
                            the place was only a village with no connection with the Nile. He dug a
                            canal 50 miles long to that great waterway, and there is now a stream of
                            vessels going up and down that canal carrying goods into the valley and
                            bringing the cotton, sugar, grain and other products out to the sea. The
                            canal was constructed by forced labor. The felleheen, to the number of a
                            quarter of million, scooped the sand out with their hands and carried it
                            away in baskets. It took them a year to dig the 50-mile ditch, and they
                            were so overworked that <measure>30,000</measure> died on the job.
                            Mehamet Ali also spent an enormous amount on the harbor, and Ismail
                            Pasha laid out more than $12,000,000 in the same way. Since the English
                            took hold they have been steadily making other improvements, and they
                            have works now under way which will cost millions more. The commerce of
                            the port is increasing enormously, and the city promises to become even
                            greater than it has been in the past.</p>

                        <head>Egypt in 1907.</head>
                        <p>The conditions at Alexandria are typical of the new Egypt. Old Mother
                            Nile has drawn on the seven-league boats of modern progress and she is
                            growing in wealth like a jimson weed in an asparagus bed. When I first
                            visited her a quarter of a century ago her country was a land of the
                            dead, with the obelisks and the Pyramids as its chief landmarks. Then
                            its most interesting characters were the mummified king of 2,000 odd
                            years ago and her chief visitors were antiquity hunters and one-lunged
                            tourists after a warm winter climate. These same characters are here
                            to-day, but in addition have come the capitalist, the syndicate and the
                            ardent dollar chaser. Egypt is now a land of banks and stock exchanges.
                            It throngs with civil engineers, irrigation experts and men interested
                            in the development of the country by electricity and steam. The delta or
                            the great tan of land which begins at Cairo and stretches out to the
                            Mediterranean is gridironed with iron tracks, and railroad trains now
                            carry one almost to the heart of Central Africa. When I was last here
                            about 16 years ago Egypt was importing goods to the amount of
                            $25,000,000 or $30,000,000. She is now buying more than $100,000,000
                            worth every 12 months and her exports are more than twice what they were
                            at that time. They now amount to $110,000,000 a year and are increasing
                            right along.</p>
                        <p>In other letters I shall describe the wonderful banking development that
                            has gone on here and the extraordinary increase in land values
                            throughout the whole valley of the Nile. I am told that in the lower
                            delta farm lands are selling from $500 to $1,000 an acre, and that
                            especially good tracts bring even more. All the way up the Nile from
                            Cairo to Assiout, for a distance of about 300 miles, you cannot buy an
                            acre of cultivable land for less than $200, and many a farmer would
                            refuse to sell his little tract for $500. Rents of lands have gone up in
                            the same proportion, and I know of farms which are bringing from $20 to
                            $50 an acre per year.</p>
                        <p>The same conditions obtain as to the real estate of the cities. Both
                            Cairo and Alexandria are inflating their values, and land is so high in
                            Cairo itself that a suburban development has begun, and in the future
                            the poorer of the foreigners will probably have their homes outside the
                            city.</p>

                        <p>I find Egypt changing in character. The Mohammedans are being corrupted
                            by the Christians, and the simple living taught by the Koran, whereby
                            the believer abstains from strong drink and other vices, has be<cb n="4"
                            />come infected with the gay and giddy pleasures of the French. Cairo,
                            the city of the Arabian nights, is fast becoming a city of Parisian
                            nights, and the Mohammedan call to prayer is now mingled with the
                            bacchanalian songs of the cafe chantants. In many cases the system of
                            the harem is being exchanged for something worse. The average Mohommedan
                            has but one wife, but in many cases he has a sweetheart in a house
                            around the corner.</p>
                        <p>The ghouls of modern science are robbing the graves of those who made the
                            Pyramids. A Telephone line has been stretched out of Cairo almost to the
                            ear of the Sphinx and there is a hotel at the base of the Pyramid of
                            Cheops, where English men and women drink brandy and soda between their

                            tourists, Our Consul General estimates that Americans alone spend almost
                            $4,000,000 here every winter and the English, French and Germans spend
                            almost as much. He estimates that there are 10,000 Americans who visit
                            the Nile Valley every season and that it costs each one of them
                            something like $10 per day for an average stay of two months.</p>

                        <p>When I first visited this country the donkey was the chief means of
                            transport, and men, women and children went about on long-eared beasts,
                            with Arab boys in blue gowns following behind and urging the animals
                            along by poking sharp sticks into patches of bare flesh, as big as a
                            dollar, which had been denuded of skin for the purpose. The donkey and
                            the donkey boy are here still, but I can get a street car in Alexandria
                            that will take me to any part of the town, and I have to jump now and
                            then to get out of the way of an automobile. There are cabs everywhere,
                            and Alexandria and Cairo have thousands of them.</p>
                        <p>The new hotels are extravagant beyond description. In this, where I am
                            now writing, the rates are from 80 to 100 piasters per day, and inside
                            the hotel walls I am as far from the old Egypt as I would be in the
                            Waldorf at New York. The servants are French-speaking Swiss in
                            swallowtail coats, and their palms itch for fees just as do those of
                            their class in our big hotels. In my bedroom there is an electric bell,
                            and I can go out into the hall and talk over the telephone to the Consul
                            General at Cairo. The hotel is packed with guests, and on its register I
                            see counts by the scare and lords by the dozen. The men come to dinner
                            in steel pen coats and the women in silks with low necks and short
                            sleeves. There is a babel of English, French and German going on in the
                            drawing-room while the guests drink coffee there after dinner, and the
                            only evidence one perceives of the land of the Pharaohs is the tall
                            minarets which here and there reach above the other buildings of the
                            city, and the voices of the muezzins as they stand upon them and call
                            out to the Mohammedans to come to prayer.</p>

                        <head>The Mohammedans Growing Rich.</head>
                        <p>The changes which I have described are by no means confined to the
                            Christians. The natives are growing rich and the Mohammedans are for the
                            first time in the history of Egypt piling up money. They are investing
                            their surplus of real estate and it is this that has done much to swell
                            all land values.</p>
                        <p>Egypt is still a country of the Egyptians, notwithstanding the government
                            of the English and the influx of the foreigners. It has now about
                            10,000,000 people and of these 9,800,000 are either Arabs or descendants
                            of the original Egyptians. The most of them are Mohammedans, although
                            there are, all told, something like 600,000 Copts. The Copts are the
                            descendants of the ancient Egyptians. They have a rude kind of
                            Christianity, and are, as a body, better educated and wealthier than the
                            Mohammedans. They are noted asclerks and are also fine workmen in gold
                            and silver and in other such trades. They are money makers and money
                            savers, and understand that many of them, especially in upper Egypt, are
                            now making fortunes. The pure Mohammedans do not as a rule go into
                            banking or money-lending. That is against the Koran and they invest most
                            of their savings in lands.</p>

                        <head>Foreigners in Egypt.</head>
                        <p>The foreign population of Egypt is less than 200,000. The greater part of
                            it is to be found in Alexandria and Cairo, and in the other towns of the
                            Nile Valley, as well as in Suez and Port Said. There are more Greeks
                            than any other. The Greeks have been exploiting the Egyptians and the
                            Nile Valley for more than two thousand years and they are to-day the
                            sharpest, shrewdest and most unscrupulous business men in it. They do
                            much of the banking and money lending, and until the Government
                            established banks of its own and brought down the rate of interest they
                            demanded an enormous usury from the Egyptian peasants. They loaned money
                            on lands and crops, and their interest rate is said to have averaged 150
                            per cent per annum.</p>
                        <p>This was changed about six years ago by the establishment of the
                            Agricultural Bank on the part of the Government, that bank lending money
                            to the farmers at 9 per cent to within 50 per cent of the value of their
                            farms. Today the peasants all over Egypt can get money at 9 per cent,
                            and the Greeks have had to come down on their rates. There are now over
                            forty thousand Greeks in Egypt and they operate as far north as the
                            Sudan.</p>
                        <p>The Italians number about twenty-five thousand, and the French somewhere
                            between fifteen and twenty thousand. There are many Italian shops here
                            in Alexandria and there are hundreds of Italians doing business in
                            Cairo. They also furnish some of the best mechanics. Many of them are
                            masons, and the greater part of the Assouan dam and other works of a
                            similar nature have been constructed by them.</p>
                        <p>There are also Germans, Austrians and<lb n="5"/> Russians, together with
                            a few Americans and Belgians. The Germans are largely in evidence as
                            clerks and they carry on mercantile businesses in many of the cities.
                            The British community amounts to about twenty thousand, but a large
                            number of these are soldiers or civil officials, and among them are
                            something like six thousand Maltese and six hundred British East
                            Indians. Practically the whole government is administered by the
                            British, although many of the subordinate officers are native Egyptians.
                            There are some French among the officials who have held over from the
                            time when France was powerful in Egypt; a few have come here to manage
                            sugar and cotton mills owned by Frenchmen, and others are shopkeepers in
                            Alexandria and Cairo.</p>

                        <head>Alexandria the Ancient.</head>
                        <p>Returning to Alexandria, sitting here in this $5 a day hotel, surrounded
                            by all the luxuries of Paris or New York, I find it hard to realize that
                            I am in one of the very oldest cities of history. I started out to-day
                            to look up relics of the past, going in a cab by mile after mile of
                            modern buildings, and travelling over the site of the metropolis which
                            flourished here long before Christ was born. The only object of note
                            still left is Pompey's pillar, and that is new in comparison with the
                            earliest history of old Egypt. It was put up only 1,600 years ago, and
                            long after Alexandria had become one of the greatest cities of the
                            world. The monument has been said to stand over the grave of Pompey, but
                            it was really erected as a landmark for sailors, a burning fire upon its
                            top being visible for miles about this part of the Mediterranean
                            Sea.</p>
                        <p>The pillar consists of a massive column of polished granite as big around
                            as the boiler of a railroad locomotive and as high as a 10-story flat.
                            It consists of one solid block of stone, standing straight up on a
                            pedestal. It was dug out of the quarries of Assonan far up the Nile
                            valley and was brought down the river on rafts and lifted in some way or
                            another to its present position. An evidence of its modern origin is now
                            to be seen in the excavation which the antiquarians are making about the
                            pedestal. During the past few months they have been digging in the earth
                            far below its foundation and have taken out several massive stone
                            sphinxes, the heads of some of which are still wrapped in cloths in
                            order to protect them from injury until they can be taken to the museums
                            of this city and Cairo. I shall send home a photograph which I have just
                            made of one of these sphinxes.</p>
                        <p>They date back to the old Alexandria and were chiselad out several
                            hundred years before Joseph and Mary took the little baby Jesus on an
                            ass across the desert into this valley of the Nile that he might not be
                            killed by Herod the King.</p>
                        <p>It was 322 years before Christ was born that this city was founded by
                            Alexander the Great, and I venture that it then had more people than it
                            has to-day. It was not only a great commercial port, but was a centre of
                            learning, religion and art. It is said to have had the grandest library
                            of antiquity. Its manuscripts numbered 900,000, and artists and students
                            came here from everywhere to study. At the time of the Caesars it was as
                            big as Boston, and when it was taken by the Arabs, along about 631 A.D.,
                            it had 4,000 palaces, 400 public baths, 400 places of amusement and
                            12,000 gardens. When Alexander the Great founded it he brought in a
                            colony of Jews, and at the time the Mohammedans came the Jewish quartet
                            had 40,000.</p>
                        <p>It was at Alexandria that St. Mark first preached Christianity to the
                            Egyptians and later on the city became one of the Christian centres of
                            the world. It was there that Hypatia lived and it was there that the
                            Christian monks led by Peter the Reader tore her from her chariot as she
                            was about to go into a heathen temple to worship and massacred her. They
                            scraped her flesh from her bones with oyster shells and then tore her
                            limb from limb.</p>
                        <p>It was here in Alexandria that Cleopatra corrupted Caesar and later on
                            brought Mark Anthony to a suicidal grave. There are carvings of
                            Cleopatra still to be seen on some of the Egyptian temples far up the
                            Nile, and I have a photograph of one which is still in good preservation
                            in the Temple of Denderah. Its features are Greek rather than Egyptian
                            and she was a Greek by her ancestry rather than a Simon-pure danghter of
                            the Nile. She was not noted for her beauty, but she had such a wondertul
                            charm of manner, sweetness of voice and brilliancy of intellect that she
                            was able to flirt with and captivate the greatest men of her time.</p>

                        <head>Came to Caesar in a Bed Tick.</head>
                        <p>Cleopatra's first Roman love was Julius Caesar, who had come to
                            Alexandria to settle the claims of herself and brother to the throne of
                            Egypt. Her father, who was one of the Ptolemies, had left his throne at
                            his death to herself and younger brother, and according to custom the
                            two were to marry and reign together. One of the brother's guardians,
                            however, had dethroned Cleopatra; he had banished her and she was not in
                            Egypt when Caesar came. It is not known whether it was at Caesar's
                            request or not, but the story goes that she made her way back secretly
                            to Alexandria, was carried inside a bed tick on the back of a servant to
                            Caesar's apartments and thus presented to the mighty Roman.</p>
                        <p>She so delighted him that he put her back upon the throne, and when he
                            left for Rome some time later he took her along and kept her there for a
                            year or so. When Caesar was murdered, Cleopatra, who had returned to
                            Egypt, made a conquest of Mark Antony and she reigned his sweetheart
                            from that time up to the day when he committed suicide upon the report
                            that she had killed herself.</p>

                    <p>The statement that Lord Methuen has been selected for the South African
                        command is semi officially confirmed. At first sight it seems a bit strange
                        that the general who was the most unsuccessful in South Africa, and the only
                        officer of note captured by the Boers during the prolonged struggle should
                        be sent to the Cape as the head of the Imperial forces there. It is
                        generally recognised that Lord Methuen is a good, but rather unfortunate
                        soldier. One indication of his worth is that he is very popular with his
                        men, whose welfare and comfort are his studies.</p>
                    <p>A circular has just been issued by the Army Council pointing out the
                        advantage of developing a system of general elementary instruction for the
                        large number of soldiers who enlist without special technical
                        qualifications. For example, it is suggested that a course in the use of
                        tools, training a man to do a little repairs about houses, or offices, the
                        cleaning of bicycles and motor cars, etc, might be useful. Non-commissioned
                        officers of the Royal Engineers would be suitable instructors of such
                        classes, but an officer or senior non-commissioned officer should take the
                        organisation in hand.</p>
                    <p>It is a bit singular that the first time that the short rifle was used in
                        anger by our troops was in firing upon British subjects—the misguided
                        Nationalist rioters of the Falls Road locality of Belfast. Only seven rounds
                        were fired, but at very close range. Three persons were shot dead, and four
                        were wounded so that in this case every bullet found its billet.</p>
                    <p>When the contemplated reductions are made in the Mediterranean Fleet, for the
                        purpose of strengthening the Channel Fleet, the battle squadron of the
                        former will consist of the first class battleships Queen (flagship of
                        Admiral Sir C. C. Drury, commanding), Prince of Wales (flagship of Prince
                        Louis of Battenberg), Vengeance, Glory, and Albion, with the four attached
                        cruisers, The Third Cruiser Squadron will remain at its present strength of
                        four first class cruisers, and the destroyer flotilla will consist of eleven
                        boats.</p>
