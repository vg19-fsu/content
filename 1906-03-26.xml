                    <head>ISOLATION ?</head>
                    <p>The isolation of Germany was proclaimed a year ago from the housetops, and
                        the isolated Empire continue? to make head diplomatically against the
                        combined Powers of the West "The Kaiser has shown his hand too soon," say
                        some of his critics; "he holds no trumps," say others, but he has already
                        scored his points despite all the critics in the world and he may score
                        still farther before the hand is played out.</p>
                    <p>Protests without number have been made against the Moroocan policy of the
                        German Empire, or the German Emperor, for in German foreign politics "L'dtat
                        c'eet moi" with a vengeance. The British and French Press have described it
                        as perfidious, execrable, mean, damnable, and intriguing. With more than
                        feminine sentimentalism our leader-writers have dilated on the perversity
                        with which the German Empire has attempted to sow discord between friendly
                        and allied Powers, has expatiated on the perils which encompass it—fines <cb n="6"/>for
                        the disturbance of the peace—and bar lamented the deterioration of German
                        pditica morality and the growing arrogance of German olaims, while it barks
                        .the question whether suoh a thing as political morality can be laid tc
                        exist at all, muchh less to govern the international relations of the
                        various Powers of the modern world.</p>
                    <p>Since the days of the Great Elector the policy of the North German statesmen
                        has never changed, and it is by the Northerner that the German Empire is
                        ruled to-day. The German's one ideal is the greatness of his country, 18th
                        century Prussia or the Empire of the present day, and unlike certain of his
                        rivals he is prepared to do more than talk for his country's greatness. He
                        has turned his back on the artistic cosmopolitanism that once made the petty
                        States of south and central Germany so attractively, so engagingly help
                        leer, for a narrow and hard but disciplined nationalism bearing as its
                        motto, "If other races stand in my way—well,so much the worse for the other
                        races." He bears the burdens of military service and of a seven State
                        discipline without wincing, and to-day be reaps the profits of a century of
                        self-abnegation and toil. Had any other Government protested against the
                        Anglo French Agreement relative to Morocco, and demanded a European
                        Conference, it would have been laughed down by the world, and had it
                        persisted the French armies and the British fleets would have made ready for
                        battle, but when Germany spoke the Powers grumbled, played with their
                        swordhilts—and went to Algeciras, for they knew they had a redoubtable
                        opponent with whom to deal and that boarhounds and similar large dogs of a
                        surly and cantankerous breed can bite as well as bark. </p>
                    <p>So far Germany has gained, and gained at all points. She has brought the
                        Powers to the Conference she has dismissed M. Delossé, she has made it
                        certain that France will not have that free hand in Morocco for which she
                        abandoned her policy of opposition to the British control of Egypt, and she
                        has done something, however little, to weaken the Anglo- French Entente, for
                        when the French people, recovering from the smart what they regard as an
                        insult, realise that Morocco may never be theirs - unless they pay a heavy
                        price or risk hopeless overthrow then the Entente will be tested and we
                        shall see what all the dinners and junketings are really worth. Again,
                        Germany has done something to gain the support of Islam : she has posed as
                        its patron, and the Saltan of Morocco and of Turkey have cause to believe in
                        her friendliness—for the present. She has perhaps secured an ally in Turkey,
                        Austria supports her with misgivings at the Conference, and may sopport her
                        in the conflict that perhaps will follow the futile sittings at Algeciras.
                        She does not love the German, she knows that the German Empire may one day
                        absorb her, but she knows too - that if that Empire falls there are other
                        foes who will rend her in pieces. The German-Austrian will probably prefer,
                        if he has any choice in the matter, to be swallowed by his unpopular kinsman
                        than to be rent in pieces by a mixed multitude of Roumanians and Magyars,
                        Italians and Slavs.</p>
                    <p>But we shall still go on speaking of Germany's isolation—though if these are
                        the fruits of isolation we may thank Heaven that Germany has no very ardent
                        allies. And the moral is that if you are efficient and pushful, you will
                        often get your way. </p>

                            might like to send a little help to further this effort for the comfort

                    <p>Some of our Cairo confréres have recently published a statement lo the effect
                        that a consession had been granted to a syndicate for the erection of
                        telephone lines to connect Port Said with several towns of the interior. The
                        news is manifestly incorrect since the telephone system already existing in
                        Port Said and Zagazig (as well as Suez) belongs to the Telephone Company of
                        Egypt, and should such lines as the local papers mention be erected by the
                        Government Telegraph Department the company in question would have the
                        preference, so that no syndicate is likely to be given a new conceusion
                        until its refusal by the existing Telephone Company, which, we understand,
                        is not the case.</p>

                        Exploration last week, said that the company had steadily opened up what the
                        board believed would prove a rich mining area. They had proved the value of
                        the Um Ros Mine, which had passed from the status of a prospect to that of a
                        crushing mine. The company had, however, suffered, as all pioneers suffered,
                        from the heavy expenses incidental to the eatablishment of a now industry,
                        end the business had increased so rapidly that it would require new capital.
                        They had spent about £40 000 in five years, and the subsidiary companies
                        £47,000 more. Generally they were slowly advancing from the exploratory
                        stage to that of valuable gold mines. Though living through bad times, as
                        far as markets were concerned, the result of the developments had left
                        little to be desired, and if times were normal no doubt they would be able
                        to dispose of the company's properties on terms which would show handsome
                        profits. Mining in Egypt as likely to produce satisfactory profits as in any
                        other part of the world, and be confidently recommended them to take shares
                        in them company which he hoped would be shortly brought before them. The
                        company had unitsued shares and other means of raising money for its own
                        purposes, but the heavy expenditure on the three mines must be undertaken by
                        a separate company.</p>

                        of the shareholders of the National Bank of Egypt, held in Cairo on Saturday
                        last, shows that during the year ouding tbo 31st December, 1905, a grow
                        profit was raised of £408.902.10.8, of which 81.724.2.10, derived from
                        special investments, are exceptional profits. Deducting rebate of interest,
                        £27,418.14.9, and the current expenses, £84,906 5.9, there remains a net
                        profit of £296,577 9.9. The following distribution is laid down by the
                        statutes of the Bank : 4 % to the capital, or 8s. per share, £100,000. 10 %
                        of the net profit to the reserve fund, £29,657.15. 10% to the directors,
                        £16,691.19 6, leaving a balance of £150,227.15 8, to which must be added the
                        balance carried forward last year. £80.417.81, making a total of
                        £180,675.3.4. The directors recommend the payment of a dividend of an
                        additional 8s. per share, which will absorb £100,000 and leave £80,675.8.4.
                        They farther recommend that a sum of £50,000, to be taken from the
                        exceptional profits referred to above, be carried to a reserve fund to be
                        employed specially for equalising future dividends and that £30,675.8.4 be
                        carried forward to profit and loss new account. Each share will thus be
                        entitled to 16s, equivalent to 8 per cent. on the capital.</p>

                    <p>The death is announced at Omdurman, of El Miralai El-Nur Bay Mohamed, so well
                        known in the recent history of the Sudan. El Nur Bey, it will be remembered,
                        was commandant of the troops at Senuar, which he valiantly defended when the
                        Mahdi's influence was rising and eclipsing that the Egyptian Government. His
                        name will always remain engraved in the history of the Sudan as that of a
                        loyal and brave soldier. </p>

                        the 31st, and Mr. Lamplough takes back with him many an inspiration for his
                        exhibition of sketches to be held in London during the early summer. It is
                        much to be regretted that Mr. and Mrs. Lamplough have finished their season
                        here under very sad circumstances. It was only a few days ago that they

                        baby daughter whom they had left with relatives less than three months ago.

                    <p>The history of the long search for the sources of the Nile is one of the most
                        facenating stories of discovery, for it begins offline antiquity end only
                        emit in the present day Sir Harry Johnson is the author of this boll which
                        is the first of a series dealing with thsi exploration of the lands and
                        seas, and he had written a most intensely interesting book which should
                        appeal especially to the inhababitants of this country, for Egypt, as
                        Herodotus long ago noted, is "the gift of the Nile." The dawn of Nile
                        exploration begins with the early histroy of Egypt, and the solution of the
                        great secret was attempted by Greeks, Abyssinians, Jews, Islamites,
                        Italians, and Portaguese, who handed on the unsolved riddle to English,
                        French, and German. Even now the Duke of the Abrozzi is fitting out an
                        expedition to explore the mysterious Mountains of the Moon, which form the
                        waterhead between the Nile and the Congo, and are situated at the head
                        waters of the White Nile. Sir Harry writes in an easy and a pleasant style,
                        which conceals the great amount of research which the compilation must have
                        cost him. We cordially recommend the work to our readers. It is published by
                        Alston Rivers, Limited, of London, end the cost is 7s. 6d.</p>

                    <p>STRONG COMMENTS ON TEA DRINKING.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Rigby, a medical practitioner, of Preston, has made a vigorous onslaught
                        on the teetotalers of the town, who, he says, attack the licensed victualler
                        in season and out of season, denying him the barest elements of justice,
                        while on two evils even graver than drink, the abuse of tea and tobacoo,
                        they are silent.</p>
                    <p>"I firmly believe," says the doctor, "that the moderate and reasonable use of
                        beer as a beverage is less harmful than the same use of tea, and that
                        immodorate tea drinking causes more pain, suffering, ill health, and nervous
                        break down than the excessive consumption of beer. If a man takes too much
                        tea the results are quite as deadly. If he takes too much tea the results
                        are quite as deadly, even more so, but as they are insidious, and not
                        generally apparent they are put down to some other cause.</p>
                    <p>"To encomerate the diseases caused by tea is like writing a quack
                        advertisment. It produces anemia, chronic gestritis, dyspepsia, and
                        emaciation ; lays the foundation for gastric ulser; causes irritability to
                        the nerves, and a whole host of nervous disorders. If any one were desirous
                        of amassing a fortune, no surer plan of doing so could be devised than to
                        make up pills of innocent materials, such as breadorumbs and extract of
                        hops, and, in the directions for their use by the public, atipulate that the
                        patient should abatain from the use of tea. The pill would have an enormous
                        sale,would do a vast amount of good, and would relieve a great ammount of
                        suffering. In fact, it would , I believe, prove more beneficial than the
                        o'oring half the public houses in Preston."</p>
                    <p>For all these reasons Dr. Rigby advises the teetotalers to refrain from their
                        favorite pursuit of baiting the "Trade," and to take action regarding the
                        use of tea and tobacco.</p>

                    <head>EXCAVATIONS IN THE DELTA.</head>
                    <p>The Temple Of Onias.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent of the Times" has supplied an instructive account of the
                        excavations undertaken during this season by the British School of
                        Archeaology in Egypt on the eastern side of the Delta and in the region of
                        Goshen and Soccoth, which will empplement the interesting details kindly
                        applied us by Professor Plinden Petrie, which we publishes on the inst. </p>
                    <p>Among the problème there, says the writer, fine of the most interesting was
                        the dearch for the site of the temple of Onias. It is well known how the
                        troubles of the Jews under Antiochus has driven many of them to settle in
                        the east of ths Delta, and that, in order provide a new rallying point, one
                        of the family of the high priests Onies IV., had built a temple on the model
                        of that at Jerusalem. This temple served as a substitue for the shrine
                        decorated and polluted" by Antiochus Epi- phanes. The documents quoted by
                        Joaephus show that this temple was at the site of an old Egyptian town named
                        Leontopolia, which was dedicated to the lion-headed goddess "Bubestis of the
                        fields," that the place was "full' of materials," that the temple was built
                        after the pattern of that at Jerusalem, that "a tower of stone 60 cubits
                        high" was erected, and that the whole settlement was granted by Ptolemy
                        Philometor. That there were many conditons to be fulfilled in the
                        identification of this site.</p>
                    <p>It has been generally recognized that the ancient town known as Tell el
                        Yehndiyeh, 18 miles north of Cairo:, was probably the position; and the
                        Jewish grave stores found there by Dr. Neville had given strength to thie
                        opinion, But the temple had not yet been actually identified. The work of
                        this season has in the first place shown that a lion goddess was worshipped
                        there, as a statue of an admiral of the Mediterranean fleet of Psametek II.
                        was found which represents him holding a shrine of the lion-headed geddess
                        Hence the name of Leontopolis and the dedication to "Bubastis of the fields"
                        accord with the worship at this site. The description of the place at being
                        "full of material's" for ruse by Oniss agrées with there baring been an
                        immense stone-lined ditch a mile in length around the ancient town, which
                        would apply material for the new building without what bad been consecratol
                        to idols. Just outside of the ancient town stands an artificial mound, the
                        highest for 20 or 30 miles around. The whole of it has been thrown up at one
                        time and, on restoring the buildings on it by the remaining indications, it
                        is found that the height most have been altogether over 59 Greek cobite
                        above the plaio, aereeing with that 60 cobitt of construction-named by
                        Josephus. And this mound was thrown up in the second century B.C, as is
                        shown by the pottery in it. On the top were many coins of the time of
                        Ptolemy Phifometor, end a1 she'd with bailding accounts which bears the name
                        of Abram among others, showing that Jews were employed. Thai every stated
                        requirement of the place of Oniaa is fulfilled this site; and there
                        connexions are bere mentioned as they have not been noticed hitherto.</p>
                    <p>The form of this settlement of Oniaa was, roughly, a right-angled triangle,

                        angle wae the entry to it, and at the south point was the enmmit with the
                        temple. The monnd was enclosed on the eastern side by a stone wall,. Soft or
                        more in height, and 767ft. long, inolnding two bastioos at the sods. In the
                        middle of this a high raised stairway, .IIP. wide, led op to the entry ot
                        the temple cort on the top. The north side ot the settlement was low, with a
                        fortification wall bounding it. The diagonal west side was curved inward,
                        and had a great revetment wall, at least 20ft. thick, tiling at an angle of
                        68ft. or more, to a height of over 63ft., where it supposted the tepple.</p>
                    <p>The entrance from the plain at the west end was nearly 130ft. wide over all,
                        and about 100ft. inside. This was fortified with towers and gateways, u we
                        know Irom descriptions. From bere the way ran through to area of three or f
                        or acres of booses enclosed in the fortifications leading up to the sample
                        platform more than 68ft. over the poir. The foundation of this ascent
                        remains, and points very closely to the axis of the court on the top. The
                        outer court was 38ft. wide and 45ft. long inside, the inner court was 94ft
                        wide end 64ft long. The block of the brick foundation of the Holly if Holies
                        is 55ft long and 17f. wide. This is of the tame proportion u in Solomon's
                        temple namely, 7 to 8 ; and it Howie that the building was Lid on with half

                        probably the most familiar to the Jews coder the Ptolemies. The architecture
                        Corinthian ; and the front of the courts. or Of the temple, had the use of
                        Syrian decoration of roanded battlements. The fronts these battlemenuts were
                        ornamented with a band of lines, which rore from the string course into each

                    <p>The religious character of the whole place is marked by the great quantity of
                        sacrifies at its foundation. In, the lower part of the mound are found on a
                        couple of cylinders of pottery, a couple of feet across. There were took in
                        the grdondre fin sacrifice was beret in each, and then the frach earth was
                        thrown in to smother the; fire, to continuation of the beapirg the mound.
                        This is it one with the Syriao sacrifices coder a bailding and the later

                        work in Palestine.</p>
                    <p>Most unhappily. the ravagos of the natives digging for earth have barely left
                        the outline of the foundationd of the temple : but 90 yeard ago the walls
                        were stending, and the pavement end pillards were seen here. It is also
                        stated <cb n="2"/>that there was an immense mass of burnt bones, thrown out on the north of the
                        town, which were very probably the remains of the daily burnt offering, long
                        since utilized by speculators in phosphates. Such a loss of an historical
                        building, owing to not recording the remains before their destruction, is an
                        object- lesson in the need of thorough research in Egypt The work will not
                        wait, and every help given to present laboors saves what will soon be
                        irrecoverable ; contributions for this purpose should be sent to the

                    <head>THE STAVRIOTES AND THE PORTE.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent of the "Daily News" writes thus from Coatantinople :</p>
                    <p>"A curious little incident has arisen in Turkey which is not without interest
                        In the far east corner of the Black Sea there exists a people called Lazes,
                        who have often been described as the descendants of Greek settlers dating
                        from the time of the Xenophon expedition. Whether this is go or no Ftire
                        Lazes appear to be of Greek blood. They are a stalwart race, and most of
                        them profess Mahomedanism. But, as in the case of so many peoples thronghont
                        the Tarkieh Empire, they accepted Islam when the condition was Islam or
                        death.</p>
                    <p>"Among them are a considerable number who, while outwardly professing the
                        religion of Mahomed, have secretly continued to practise Christian rites and
                        to be bnried with the ceremonies of the Orthodox Greek Choroh. These people
                        are known as Stavriotos, or Children of the Cross. Within the la"t month two
                        priests were exiled because they conducted funeral eervioes over two
                        Stavriotes, the local Governor declaring that the men were Moslems, and that
                        Christian ceremonies were not permissible.</p>
                    <p>"When the exile of the two priests was reported to the Patriaroh here he took
                        up the matter very seriously, and sent a protest to the Prte in very strong
                        terms. I have not seen it, but an informant who has tells me that he doubts
                        whether the chief cf any charoh in Tarkey ever sent a stronger one. It is
                        not difficult to see that powerful arguments could be added by him showing
                        that religions liberty to all subject of Turkey has been repeatedly flaunted
                        in the eyes of Europe. . The matter made so little progress that on
                        Satarday, ths 3rd lost, the Patriaroh declared that if the Porte did not
                        ooosply with his demands he would refuse to celebrate Holy Communion in a
                        church yesterday where he had promised to officiate.</p>
                    <p>"I am assured that be received a message from the Palace which concerened
                        some of his demands, and as a matter of fact, he did celebrate yesterday in
                        the church where be had promised to efficiate tyevious to his message. Had
                        he refused to officiate, there would have at once bean an outory through all
                        the Orthodox Churches in the world and the porte is wise in not allowing the
                        question to become a serious one."</p>

                    <p>March Skye Meeting</p>
                    <p>The racing season at Alexandria opened on Saturday under auspicious
                        circnumsatances. The club's March Skpe Meeting, though posturing no
                        particular interest frem a racing standpoint, was very well attended, and
                        from a social point of view at least wsd a success.</p>
                    <p>The weather was if anything too warm. The first khamseen of the season would
                        have made it unpleasantly so bad it not been for a cool breeze which
                        prevailed all the afternoon and which, after sunset, made it distinctly
                        cold. The warm weather brought a large namber, of the fair sex wearing Tight
                        spring frocks,, and their presence lent animation and colour to the

                        déterminée par une cause tout h fiait transitoire. D'ailleurs, tout porte à
                        croire que le loyer de l'argent ne tardera pas it snbir une réduction
                        sensible après la liquidation de fin de mois, car les conditions de la
                        situation monétaire sur les mprobés régulateurs euro péens vont toujours
                        s'améliorant.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte

                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
