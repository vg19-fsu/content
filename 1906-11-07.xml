                    <head>THE UNREST IN MOROCCO.</head>
                    <p>The telegrams from Tangier to-day show that the situation in Morocco is as
                        acute as ever. In an article entitled "Anarchy in Morocco, published by the
                        "Echo de Paris," M. André Mévil says the danger is that the Europeans will
                        lose patience: Consequently it may be necessary to find a means of applying
                        the decisions arrived at by the Conference at Algeciras. That course would
                        introduce some order into a situation which, if allowed to continue as at
                        present, would become inextric able in some months. France has caused
                        representations to be made to the Sultan at Fez within the past few days,
                        but he has thus far declined to give satisfaction. M. Mévil adds:-"I am
                        informed that those demands have been drawn up in very threatening terms!
                        Finally, we are said to be determined to wait no longer, but to act if we do
                        not receive complete satisfaction. The despatch from our correspondent at
                        Tangier to the effect that the Sultan has decided to send a mission to
                        Tafilet to pacify the population would seem to show that our resolute
                        attitude has already produced its effect. But it is to be hoped that it will
                        not prove to be too late."</p>
                    <p>In the course of a general survey of the international situation, in the. "R
                        publique Française," M. Maurice Ordinaire says that the Moroccan question is
                        recognized as the most urgent and anxious problem of the moment. It is, he
                        adds, the duty of France herself to show more zeal for the international
                        reforms upon which Europe has decided than any other nation. Whatever may be
                        thought of the likelihood of the success of those reforms, France ought to
                        desire to see them applied, because the sooner that is done the sooner will
                        her legitimate claims, which have been checked, be justified. It is there
                        that the French Government should show the greatest vigilance. Morocco is
                        not only one of the pieces in the great international game that is now being
                        played between the two groups into which Europe is divided. It is of still
                        more pressing interest as by their choice, through imprudence or design, of
                        that Mussulman territory as the field for their intrigues the Powers have
                        contributed to develop the so-called Pan- Islamic agitation, which extends
                        to the whole Mediterranean coast, and which inspires Lord Cromer in Egypt
                        with the same preoccupations as those which trouble M. Jonnart in Algeria.
                        That agitation furnishes, in M. Ordinaire's opinion, confused and obscure
                        yet obvious signs of a spirit of independence, the signal for which has been
                        given by Asia, and which Europe cannot afford to ignore.</p>
                    <p>The "Dépêche Coloniale," however, which has apparently received more
                        reassuring information respecting the state of affairs on the
                        Algero-Morrocan frontier since the publication of its somewhat alarmist
                        article of the 22nd ulto., says that the expected conflict in Southern Oran
                        could only become serious through a want of foresight on the part of the
                        French military authorities. But, it adds, there is no such lack of
                        foresight. Indeed, a continual qui vive has familiarized the French troops
                        in the advanced posts with difficult situations The anti-French agitation in
                        Tafilet and incitements to an attack upon the French garrisons, attributable
                        to agents in personal relations with Fez and the Maghzen, are established
                        facts and serious ones, deserving consideration and necessitating defensive
                        measures. But, at the same time, the French people must not lose their
                        composure because a holy war is preached by some ridiculous marabouts who
                        would fly into the bush at the first rifle shot. What is necessary is to be
                        exactly informed as to the preparations of the inhabitants of Tafilet and
                        other tribes in contact with the Algerian population, and to be ready to
                        repel an aggression en masse. Police operations of the kind likely to be
                        required, though on a slightly larger scale than usual, do not, in the
                        opinion of the "Dépêche Coloniale," call for so much newspaper discussion,
                        which is calculated to alarm public opinion although intended to reassure
                        it. Unless some unexpected event should occur before the close of Ramadan,
                        the "Dépêche. Coloniale" anticipates that the tribes, excited in favour of a
                        holy war by fasting and prayer, are likely to calm down suddenly "on finding
                        that the French outposts are awaiting their onset with the equanimity
                        inspired by a supply of ammunition for their mitrailleuses and a reserve of
                        powder and ball. "Whatever may happen, it will not be serious, because we
                        are not setting out for the conquest of Morocco. Algeria is simply preparing
                        to eject a hostile mob who propose to install themselves in her
                        ante-chamber,'</p>

                    <p>On Sunday night a horrible tragedy, which is believed to have been the
                        consequence of the conversion of a Copt to the Faith of Islam, was enacted
                        in a small village of the Minieh Samanoad Markaz. It was for the purpose of
                        inarriage that the man bad accepted the Islamic creed, and the recently
                        married couple were foully murdered as they lay asleep. That robbery was not
                        the motive of the crime is proved by the fact that nothing is missing from
                        the house and the murder is put down to relations of the convert.The
                        authorities are making rigorous in quiries and are actively searching for
                        evidence to enable them to trace the murderer or murderers, bot up to the

                    <head>SCHENUTE OF AKHMIN.</head>
                    <p>Herr J. Leipoldt on his "Schenate von Atripe und die Entstehung des National.
                        Eryptohen Christentums" has written a fairly complete account of the fanatic
                        and bellicose Archimandrite of the famous White Monastery near Akhmin. The
                        literary sources for the biography of the Coptic ecclesiastic of the fifth
                        century are copious, and Herr Leipoldt has made good use of those in Paris,
                        London. and Berlin, but there are many others in Paris and Naples with which
                        he does not appear to be familiar. Scheoute who was born in 334 and died in
                        451, was learned for his time, knowing Greek well and quoting the classics,
                        but he was truly Coptic in spirit. Philosophy, metaphysics, and science he
                        despised, All who did not agree with the views of the Christian religion
                        held as correct by previous. Coptic theologians were to him heretics and fit
                        only for the Evil One.</p>
                    <p>His value lay chiefly in the strict discipline to which he subjected monks
                        and nuns under his control, in which, however, he was carrying out rules
                        laid down by his predecessor Pakomins. He also made the White Monastery a
                        refuge for the Copts, who at his era were in great poverty and misery owing
                        to frequent incursions of barbarians. His energy however found chief vent in
                        der unciation of paganism, that is, the old Egyptian religion, whose temples
                        and monuments he destroyed and burnt. His influence was confined chiefly to
                        Upper Egypt and certainly tended to improve the very lex morals of the
                        Coptic Christians of that region. In the "Journal of Theological Studies"
                        Mr. W.B. Crom has published all the Coptic inscriptions at the White
                        Monastery, some of which refer to Schenute. The most interesting however are
                        those giving a catalogue of the library. Some of the later ones are in
                        Arabic, but written with Coptic characters.</p>

                    <p>Referring to the chrysanthemum show which was held at San Stefano last
                        Saturday and Sunday, a correspondent recalls that of the gardens of Ancient
                        Egypt, Athenæus, a professor at Alexandria, wrote that the roses, lilies,
                        and other flowers were too numerous to mention the fact that Cleopatra
                        squandered a talent (£20) on roses alone for one of her gorgeous banquets is

                    <p>In the second century A.D. Egypt probably possessed all the flowers of Syria,
                        Persia, and India. Roses were shipped from Alexandria for Rome. The art of
                        forcing flowers and fruit was known in Egypt as far back as 4000 B.C., and
                        it continued to 695 A.D., when Abdul Aziz built himself a winter garden at

                    <head>EGYPTIAN PUBLIC SPIRIT.<lb/>THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY..</head>
                    <p>The Nationalist Press is already beginning to grumble because the
                        subscriptions for the National University scheme are coming in so slowly.
                        One vernacular contemporary, in despair at the lack of generosity, advocates
                        a State lottery as a forlorn hope for obtaining funds. But it is foolish for
                        the Arabic Press to complain, and all their exhortations are bound to be
                        fruitless, as they are founded on utterly false premises. The Oriental has
                        no idea of what public spirit means in the European sense of the word, and
                        he is quite unable to combine except in religion. The natives are so
                        destitute of the first principles of intelligent combination that, despite
                        their enormous wealth and increasing intelligence, they have been unable to
                        run any limited company with success. In fact the only two native companies,
                        the Tewfikieh Nile Navigation Company and the Fayoum Light Railway Company,
                        were dismal failures.</p>
                    <p>This lack of co-operation is specially noticeable in the case of the
                        Nationalist movement, where, in spite of torrents of talk, there has as yet
                        been no sign of any attempt to organize a Party, and it remains a simple
                        stalking horse for self advertising journalists. Even their benevolent
                        societies are not self-supporting, although the native is rolling in wealth,
                        and the Orwa-el-Woska is glad to receive an annual grant from the Alexandria
                        Municipality. Where there is so much talk in the vernacular Press of the
                        capacity of Egyptians to govern themselves and of their ability to stand
                        alone politically, it is astonishing to find that they show no desire to
                        found a native bank or financial companies, but on the contrary are quite
                        content to leave all these things in the hands of Europeans.</p>
                    <p>So with the National University scheme. The idea has caught on with great
                        enthusiasm, but there is no general desire on the part of the wealthy
                        classes to contribute, and some of the leading native newspapers, in order
                        to extort money for the scheme, had to resort to the discreditable trick of
                        making false statements as to individuals coming forward with contributions,
                        in the hope that they would be too shamefaced to draw back after seeing
                        their names in print.</p>
                    <p>Now these same newspapers are grumbling at their compatriots' parsimony, and
                        we think our contemporaries very anreasonable in s0 doing. The Egyptian's
                        sense of co-operation is as yet totally undeveloped, both socially and
                        po.itically, and it will require years and years of evolution before they
                        can entertain any glimmerings of cohesion and combination. This is the real
                        reason why the subscriptions do not roll in. It is quite a mistake to think
                        that it is due to any miserly proclivities, for the young generation is only
                        too pleased to fling its money away on the gambling tables of Europe or the
                        pleasures of Paris. For, as the Egyptian Princess Nazli Hanem told Mr. de
                        Guerville :-"The new generation is not worth the rope to hang itself with.
                        It thinks of nothing but the cut of its clothes, the shape of its boots, or
                        the possession of a European girl for its mistress, who sucks them dry
                        physically and morally, as well as emptying their purses. The influence
                        which these women exercise over our youth is fantastic and deplorable. They
                        ruin them in every way, and make of them nothing more nor less than human
                        scarecrows." With such counter attractions the subscription list to the
                        National University must of course suffer.</p>

                    <head>HIGHER EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>In referring to the scheme for establishing a National University, the
                        "Globe" says:- The promoters of the movement for establishing a brand new
                        and improved University in Egypt cannot be congratulated on the oppor-
                        tuneness of their project. In view of recent events, it is bound to wear a
                        suspicious appearance as more conducive to political unrest than to the
                        dissemination of higher caltare, its profassed object. We do not allege that
                        it has that character, but Mustapha Pasha Kamel, the cleverest agitator in
                        Egypt, is endeavouring to create belief that he and his restless associates
                        are covertly operating the scheme. The "Times" correspondent at Cairo
                        expresses misgiving that this new educational institution will, unless great
                        care be taken, become much more nationalist than national, and so fall under
                        the control of influences inimical to British guidance. Apart from that
                        grave objection, it is very doubtful whether the country really needs
                        another University; that of Al Azhar furnishes as much higher education as
                        seems to be desired by the large majority of the inhabitants. What they want
                        ie, not so much deep learning as its appearance, with a view to make
                        commercial profit out of the superficial show. In India, we have had
                        plentiful proof of the mischief resulting from the multiplication of
                        Universities. The students regard the taking of a degree as the passport to
                        Government employment, and when that reward does not fall to them, their
                        bitter disappointment at the waste of time and money saps their loyalty.
                        That deplorable condition of affairs would be sure to occur in Egypt if the
                        new University were associated, directly or indirectly, with the State.
                        Happily, its promoters propose to raise the half million sterling required
                        by an appeal to the wealthier classes, and the result should indicate
                        whether there is any genuine demand for the proposed institution.</p>

                        communication to his Government on the subject of the importation. of
                        Servian cattle into Egypt :-</p>
                    <p>"The Servian, Government are engaged in pourparlers with Egypt with the
                        object of opening new markets in this country. M. Popovitch was sent on a
                        mission to Egypt to discuss this question, and his efforts have 80 far been
                        fruitfal. Indeed, the arrival of ten loads of Sarvian cattle at Alexandria
                        is announced, and it is said this will be followed immediately by many
                        others.</p>
                    <p>"This news is welcomed on every hand, for it is hoped that these arrivals
                        will lower the price of meat, which is relatively dear, and which gives rise
                        to great, and frequent complaints.</p>
                    <p>"It will be of some interest to our French cattle breeders to learn the
                        position which they might occupy in Egypt, for out of a total of L.E.
                        579,706 of animals and alimentary products of animals imported during the
                        last seven months (of which Turkey claims L.E. 403,088), France only
                        occnpies third place with L.E. 20,136, leaving England and Italy far ahead;
                        and, again, in these import figures French beasts only take the lowest
                        place, as, for instance, in 1905, out of a sum of LE. 33,575 they only
                        accounted for L.E. 1,363.</p>
                    <p>"Seeing that Servian cattle can find a market in Egypt, while they have to
                        face the same difficulties of transport, there is no doubt that our
                        products, the quality of which is infinitely superior, could take first

                    <p>An instructive example of the pit-falls which beset the journalist in such a
                        cosmopolitan country as Egypt, is afforded by the campaign which has been of
                        late waged by Mr. Benaohi, president of the Hellenic community of
                        Alexandria, against the Greek daily local newspaper Telegraphos." A short
                        time ago a paragraph appeared in that paper dealing with the excellence of
                        the new service of steamers of the Roumanian Line, which have begun to run
                        between Alexandria, Athens, Constantinople, and Constanza. Now it is the
                        duty of a journalist in Egypt to always bear in mind that the great
                        international dispates in Europe and elsewhere always have a reecho in this
                        country, and therefore, as one phase of the Macedonian troubles has been
                        Roumania's hostility to the Greeks, it was considered high treason for a
                        Greek newspaper in Alexandria to advertise the new Roumanian line.
                        Consequently the President of the Hellenic community of Alexandria felt that
                        it was incumbent on him to take up the ondgels, and therefore pressure was
                        brought to bear on the subscribers of the "Telegraphos' to induce them to
                        desist from any further support of that paper.</p>

                        Islamism and Nationalism are mutual opposites, mutual contradictions, the

                        "patrie" that does not exist, that never can be won. That Pan-Islamism is a
                        vain illusion, that the different Moslem countries are as many district
                        units, that the combination in one vast whole of all these incompatible

                        nor in the East has the religious crucible ever produced a durable fasion,
                        that the differences between races and peoples obey a law of nature from
                        which none escape ;...... that, to sum up, such a programme resuscitated

                        recently. The school has been founded by King Leopold, and will work in
                        conjunction with the similar establishments of London and Liverpool. Its
                        principal object will be the study of sleeping sickness. Dr. Van Campenhout,
                        the director of the colonial sanatorium of Watermael, where two cases of
                        sleeping sickness were recently cured, is at the head of the Brussels
                        school.</p>

                    <head>BANDMANN OPERA COMPANY.<lb/>A RETROSPECT.</head>
                    <p>The Bandmann Company have now left Cairo after a series of most creditable
                        performances to themselves, that is; for we cannot say much for some of the
                        plays. All the plays, except for "The Little Michus," are rather of the
                        rag-bag, patchwork quilt order, introducing songs and dances wherever seems
                        most conven. ient; and one would really think that Mesers. Hicks, Rubens,
                        Sidney Jones, and the rest agres to make one Vest stock of such items on
                        which they draw, say, ten per play. But, after all, it is only musical
                        comedy, and some of it is not so bad.</p>
                    <p>The best pieces, perhaps, were "The Spring Chicken," "he Run Away Girl," and
                        perhaps "Florodora." "The Catch of the Season" and Sergeant Brae" are fatile
                        efforts: The Belle of New York" was too big for the troupe t to handle, The
                        Earl and the Girl" and "At Chinese Honeymoon" were both 80-80, not much
                        more. "Lady Madcap" is very slight, but good of its kind. "The Geisha," of
                        course, we know these many years it has prettier music than the rest-except
                        the 'Michus'-but it is not very wonderful. "Aladdin" is all very well as
                        pantomime, but it is rather "Anathema" from any other point of view.</p>
                    <p>Still, taken altogether, the repertoire gave 08 a very fair twelve days'
                        amusement. Now for the company.The staging, scenery, and dresses are quite
                        good. The conducting varied a little. Mr. Warwick Major has great energy and
                        undoubted ability, and he had a very ragged orchestra to handle; but now and
                        again he seems to be a little hard on his performers, and disinclined to
                        help them out sufficiently. Of course, with all musical comedy songs, great
                        liberties are taken. Perhaps once or twice this was overdone; and then the
                        local orchestra probably did not expect it. As to encorer, we heard
                        occasional objections that the Major did not always allow them when they
                        seemed justified, but really we think encores are most unnecessary except
                        when the audience really clamour for them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cole is the great man of the company. He enlivened the dallest piece, and
                        showed himse'f to be a born ocmedian in every way. Miss Corlass was always
                        delightful and danced charmingly. She can sing as well as any one, but as a
                        rule she is too fond of "scamping" the note, so as to make some point or
                        emphasize some word. She spoilt the "Tact", song in "Florodora" thereby. But
                        that she has a voice, and a most sweet, true voice, she showed fully in the
                        St. Valentin in "The Michus." That was the most exquisite bit of music of
                        all that we heard through the twelve pieces. Miss Corlass's acting is always
                        good, though perhays a little too autocratic in "The Geisha." Mr. Attwell
                        and Miss Nina Leslie are the two "how" singers of the company. Miss Leslie
                        bas a powerful, well-trained, and sweet voice, and Mr. Attwell hes a very
                        pleasing high baritone -hardly tenor-the tone, except for one or two upper
                        notes, is distinctly baritone and he uses it to advantage. He and Miss
                        Leslie both "caught on" to the compass of the theatre at once. Miss Morra is
                        a very excell ent little dancer, and she sings and acts well up to her
                        various parts. Mr. Lester and Mr. Smith are both usefu', but there is a
                        certain sameness and lack of originality in their acting; though both of
                        them did excellently in the "Michus." The rest of the company are quite
                        good; indeed one or two of them should have been given a better chance,
                        notably Mr. Hayden and Miss Minnie Leslie. The chorus was very fair but not
                        always strong enough for the theatre; but then they were not at fall
                        strength. How should they be at the end of a two years' tour ?</p>
                    <p>To som up, they are a good, even a very good travelling company, and their
                        perfor mances deserve all our gratitude for filling so ably the rather dull
                        period between the summer and the season; that fortnight when Cairo is just
                        rubbing its eyes preparatory to awakening to the greater festivities of the
                        winter.</p>

                    <head>MODEL WORKSHOPS.</head>
                    <p>In concluding his report upon the model workshops of Egypt, Johnson Pasha
                        says:- As this is in all probability the last report on the Model Workshops
                        which I shall have the honour of presenting. I may be pardoned for
                        expressing the hope that in the future the considerations which led to the
                        adoption of a system, which I think I may say has proved successful, may not
                        be forgotten or overlooked. The first and foremost of these considerations
                        was that instenotion in the work of the hands should be through practice
                        assisted by theory, not through theory illustrated by practice. It is in
                        vain that the brain may know how the hands should move, if the hands have
                        not been trained to obey the brain. As the French proverb has it, "A forger
                        on devient forgeron." This principle with the stress and impulse given to
                        work, by actual compliance with orders given under what are practically
                        ordinary trade conditions, are to my mind the essential points of the
                        system. Details may and probably will be changed, and changed to advantage,
                        and doubtless many developments may be possible and advantageous in the
                        fatare, which were impossible when the institution was in its infarcy, but I
                        trust the under lying principles may be able to hold their own.</p>

                        eighteen, and in 1882 he served as adjutant to the 1st Battalion in Egypt,
                        taking part in the battle of Tel e! Kebir (medal with clasp, 5th class Me
                        'jidieh, Khedive's star). In 1885 he went to the Sudan as Major of the
                        Guard's Brigade and fought at Ha-heen and Tofrek, and in the latter action
                        was severely wounded. He was also severely wounded at the action of Belmont
                        in the South African War. On his return to England he was made Lieut. Col.

                        rode alone from Mskemmeh to Korti with despatches announcing the death of
                        Gordon and the fall of Khartoum. For his services there he was mentioned in

                        <p>House of Lords - The discussion on the amendments to the Education Bill
                            was continued yesterday. The character of the Bill has been almost
                            completely transformed.</p>
                        <p>At the conference of the Non-Conformist Councils, met here, it was
                            resolved to organise demonstrations against the House of Lords. A
                            speaker suggested that the Government should appoint 500 Liberal Peers
                            to carry the original Bill through. (Reuter)</p>

                    <head>Old Egyptian Industry.</head>
                    <p>Paper Produced From Papyrus</p>
                    <p>Enterprise Rewarded</p>
                    <p>Success seems to have crowned the enterprise of Mr. Smedley Norton, the well
                        known author and explorer, in his attempt to revive the papyrus-growing
                        industry of Egypt, which has been extinct for over a thousand years. A large
                        tract of land is now under cultivation, and it is confidently believed that
                        the result will be the production of a better quality of paper than any yet
                        on the market, at a much cheaper price</p>
                    <p>So long ago as the seventh century papyrus-growing was a staple industry in
                        Egypt, but through neglect the plant ceased to grow. What travellers on the
                        Nile believe to be papyrus is nothing but Nile grass, which is quite useless
                        for the manufacture of paper. Mr. Norton, who has explored Egypt
                        successfully, obtained seed from remote parts of Syria and Palestine,
                        principally from the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan.
                        Any endeavour to cultivate the plant there would be futile for commercial
                        purposes, as there is no provision for the transit of the reed to the coast
                        in adequate quantities. A specimen of the plant which was successfully
                        raised on the Nile by Mr. Norton has been certified by Mr. C.B. Clarke, of
                        Kew Gardens, to be the true papyrus,and after exhaustive experiments Dr.
                        Querin Weirtz, consulting chemist and analyst to the Paper Makers'
                        Association of Great Britain, has produced pulp which he pronounces
                        admirable for paper-making, and remarks that its adoption is only a question
                        of quantity obtainable, price, collection, and freight." </p>
                    <p>All this has been carefully calculated. Mr. H.E. Winter, who is closely
                        associated with the scheme, said, in an interview with a representative of
                        "The Daily News"; "All the pros and cons of the matter have been considered
                        by a committee of experts, and the result has been under the level of the
                        Nile. It has to be ploughed only once in five years, and that very deeply,
                        so that, with cheap labour, the cost of production will not be great.</p>
                    <p>"We shall have seven or eight hundred acres under cultivation at first, and
                        shall be able to send over about 100,000 tons of raw material in the first
                        twelve months, commencing next Spring. To start with, we shall have it made
                        into pulp in British factories, but later we shall have our own mill on the
                        spot, so that the cost of freight will be considerably lessened when we
                        export the material from Egypt in the form of pulp. Experiments have proved
                        that the yield of papyrus pulp, after bleaching, is much larger than that of
                        esparto pulp, and it is exceedingly strong. In the old days the natives used
                        to make suits of clothes and boats out of the paper made from papyrus. We
                        shall make paper for newspapers and books, and also for wall
                        decoration."</p>

                        <p>Our Manners and Morals</p>
                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Sir, -An interesting feature of the Press campaign now being carried on
                            by our Nation alist opponents is the reiteration of attacks on our
                            morals and our manners. We British are accused of superciliousness,
                            discourtesy, and aloofness. Mustapha Pasha Kamel falls back on these
                            accusations whenever at a loss of material. "Al Moayad" gives us a
                            lamentable picture of young Englishmen standing pipe in mouth and
                            trousers turned up at the ends, accompanied - horror of horrors - by
                            their dogs in the presence of Legislative Councillors, Ministers, and
                            other grave and reverend seniors. In fact, we are accused of boorishness
                            and arrogance at all times and season, and the good patriot who is
                            zealous for the reputation of his countrymen naturally feels pained that
                            such accusations should be brought against them and apparently accept as
                            being wholly true by the readers of many Nationalist journals.</p>
                        <p>As far as I can gather, there is some ground for the assertion that the
                            British and the educated Moslems of Egypt have to some extent drawn
                            apart since the Occupation. But the fault is not all on our side, and in
                            justice to our countrymen let me attempt to explain their conduct.</p>
                        <p>In many cases the young Englishman has no conscious bias against the
                            people of the country, but his tastes, but interests, and his work lead
                            him among his fellow countrymen, or at least among other Europeans, and
                            by force of circumstances he finds it difficult to meet any Egyptian
                            Moslem, other than a bowab or a ferrash, and the former is probably a
                            Berberine. He cannot spend much time in <cb n="3"/>studying the people
                            his work is often sufficiently hard - especially if he is a member of
                            that energetic commercial section of our colony of which we are rightly
                            proud - to make him hail with joy the coming of a few leisure hours
                            which he can devote to bridge, games, or some form of exercise or to
                            reading, to which he may be devoted. Be it remembered that the very
                            knowledge of Arabic is no longer a necessity for many members of the
                            colony. Commercial men have their clerks who can interpret Arabic or
                            Turkish into English or at least French. Servants are learning pidgin
                            English or Nilotic Italian in large numbers and even should they be
                            innocent of a word of their master's tongue, it is parlous Arabic that
                            one learns from the Berberine.</p>
                        <p>Then there are those who consciously avoid intercourse with the native -
                            I have nothing to say on behalf of some of them - their insularity is
                            irreclaimable; they will have no traffic with any but true born Anglo
                            Saxons - or ancient Britons - who, by the way, often boast strangely
                            exotic names.</p>
                        <p>Still these interesting survivals of days when ententes were undreamt of
                            and foreigners qualified by sauguinary adjectives by the multitude must
                            be decreasing in numbers. They are a dwindling band - they are out of
                            fashion in days of Lord Mayoral visits and international flirtations,
                            and we have to thank the national snobbishness for the certainty that
                            the unfashionable will speedily pass away. It is a "good form" now to be
                            civil to foreigners, and John Bull to his amazement find that civility
                            is appreciated. Being - in reality - very pleased to hear himself
                            complimented on virtues which he had thought were unappreciated by a
                            hostile world, he grows more amicable every day and is indeed likely to
                            suffer from his kindly advances to certian rather surly and jealous
                            neighbours.</p>
                        <p>But there are other who have reasons for their refusal to mix to any
                            extent with native society, and their reasons may be summarised as
                            follows :--</p>
                        <p>"We are not anxious to pose as saints or to ride high moral hobby horses
                            to the death. But what we have seen and heard of good Moselm society,
                            does not make us anxious to frequent it. Turks, Albanians and
                            Circassians we like but they are rare and grow steadily rarer. The
                            Egyptian Moslem of pure or mixed race has in our opinion two great
                            weaknesses. He cannot as a rule be trusted to behave civilly to European
                            women. We grant that all countries have their Arries and their rakes but
                            the Egyptian cad is unusually offensive. They neglect the good points in
                            our civilisation, but wallow in its mire. Their knowledge and ideas of
                            European women are based on their acquaintance with such poor creatures
                            who have been driven by financial reasons to disreagard ethnological
                            considerations. They do not meet respectable European women and their
                            ways of thinking are not such as to make them desirable visitors to a
                            European household. We think that it is too risky an experiment to bring
                            the average Egyptian Moslem into our houses. We generalise - but we must
                            generalise. We do not find the same weaknesses among decent Turks,
                            Syrians, and other Eastern races, Moslem or Christian. We know that the
                            former, however low their opinion of women, can be trusted - that the
                            majority of Eastern Christians know what home life is, and respect women
                            in word and conduct.</p>
                        <p>Again we find the extraordinary moral laxity of the people a deterrent.
                            We out men who cheat at car is. We avoid gaol birds, we regard
                            fraudulent bankrupts with aversion; even if the memory of former
                            friendship or pity for the man who has gone under prompts us at times to
                            continue our connection with him, we do not ask our friends to meet him.
                            But here we find an amazing and phenomenal tolerance. We see a swindling
                            mudir the object of universal sympathy, we see gaol birds received on
                            their return by their respectable friends with demonstrations of joy, we
                            find ourselves introduced to worthies whore grue some record does not
                            prevent their sitting on the divans of decent men. We know that the
                            European adventurer is to be found in Egypt, and we regret it. But we do
                            not rush into his arms, nor do we hold that a man eminently respectable
                            because he is rich. Such is one defence. We should of course be called
                            canting hypocrites by the Englishmen who backed the Burghers against our
                            troops and now support Mustapha Kamel. But we have our reasons, and
                            there they are. No doubt there is some exageration in this indictment,
                            but in the writer's opinion it contains a great deal of truth. And what
                            is the moral - well, that morals are wanted by the younger generation of
                            Egyptians, as much as intellect.</p>
