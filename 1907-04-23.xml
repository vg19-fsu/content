                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <p>ARABIC FOR "FLOWS THE WATER."</p>
                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                    <head>SIR ELDON GORST AND EGYPTS FINANCIAL POSITION.</head>
                    <p>The "Financier," in expressing satisfaction at the appointment of Sir Eldon
                        Gorst as successor to Lord Cromer, emphasizes the necessity of a
                        continuation of the policy so ably pursued by his predecessor. In one sense,
                        I says the writer, continuity was certain, whatever might have been the
                        predilection of the j new man. The British Government are not pledged to any
                        heroic or submissive measures in Egypt, nor to any measures at all. Their
                        policy there, as would be the policy of any sane British Ministry, is to
                        leave well alone. But there is continuity and continuity, just as there is
                        progress and progress. The continuity of Sir Eldon Gorst will not only be
                        the adoption and continuance of Lord Cromer's policy, but the continuity of
                        Lord Cromer's policy as Lord Cromer himself would have wished to continue it
                        had his health and strength permitted.</p>
                    <p>In the last report penned by the great Consul-General on Egyptian affairs
                        considerable reference was made to the Nationalist agitation. The true
                        significance of the "nationalism" so-called can be to some extent gauged by
                        a reference to the Egyptian statistics on illiteracy. Little more than three
                        per cent, of the adult population of Egypt proper can read and write. The
                        educational system now established has only been in existence about ten
                        years. It is as effective and thorough as circumstances permit, but the
                        results are not yet exhibited among adults. It will be another ten years
                        before the manhood of the country is sufficiently equipped to make a genuine
                        public opinion possible. In the interval there will, in the absence of
                        unforeseeable difficulties arising, be immense material progress. The
                        Egyptian peasantry are in a fair way of becoming the most prosperous in the
                        world. Agriculture is already thriving, and manufactures are sure to develop
                        in its train. The resources of the country are so prodigious, when utilised
                        in an intelligent way, as is now happening, that it is almost easier to say
                        what Egypt will be than what it will not be.</p>
                    <p>The foundation-stones of Egyptian prosperity have been laid well and solidly
                        and deeply—laid by Lord Cromer. The superstructure is rising up in
                        magnificent dimensions, and Sir Eldon Gorst, the new architect, with the
                        plans before him, the materials at hand, will see that the edifice is
                        continued in the same design.</p>
                    <p>To leave figures of speech, one may be quite sure that the administration of
                        Egypt will be carried on under the guidance of Sir Eldon Gorst with no less
                        regard for the needs of the community and the dictates of justice than was
                        the case under his distinguished prodecessor. The outlook is in no way
                        clouded. The abundance of recent fiotatious shows the popular impression
                        which prevails, and it will, perhaps, be no matter for regret if the
                        financial pace is a little moderated as the year gets older.</p>

                    <head>MR. WILFRID BLUNT AGAIN.</head>
                    <p>Lord Cromer could not make his retirement, of course, without a certain
                        amount of street corner barking, and the "Daily News" finds room for Mr.
                        Wilfrid Blunt to insinuate that the British Agent's plea of ill-health is a
                        false-hood, and that he and his policy have in reality been thrown over by
                        the British Government.</p>
                    <p>It is a pleasure for a certain class of Englishmen to perform the dirty work
                        to which foreign and not too friendly critics refuse to condescend Even the
                        "Cologne Gazette" does not withhold its tribute to the great work which is
                        Lord Cromer's monument. Everything that England has bestowed on Egypt in the
                        last twenty-five years, says the German journal, is "substantial, enduring,
                        and secure." That is handsome recognition which we shall make a note of, in
                        case circumstances should tempt our contemporary to change its mind. For the
                        present, it is only in the ears of the British Radical that the would be
                        wreckers of Egypt can expect a hearing.</p>

                            feet. An ample supply of fresh water was found, but it was found
                            impossible to protect it from the influx of sea water. A second boring

                            progress, The posts and telegraphs building has just been taken over by
                            that department, and has been transferred from the temporary quarters to
                            a fine building facing the entrance to the Port. The works for the

                            bridge will be ready by the end of July. Although few plots of land have

                        <head>EUROPEAN TESTIMONY.</head>
                        <p>The universal testimony of the Press of the civilized world to the
                            excellent results of Lord Cromer's work in Egypt is to be seen in the
                            extracts. from the foreign newspapers reproduced in the English Press
                            and every mail that arrives brings a fresh mass of testimony. The fact
                            that German, French, Italian and Austrian newspapers of all shades of
                            opinion are loud in their praise of the regeneration of Egypt should
                            convince such egregious persons as Ahmed Yehia Pasha and Mustapha Pasha
                            Kamel that our hold over Egypt is recognized by Europe to be founded
                            under the only Indefeasible tenure: that of making the best use of it
                            When an individual is too infirm and decrepit to manage his affairs, a
                            robust man takes his place, and so it is with States. The weak one may
                            cry out that might is not right, hut such a cry finds a very feeble
                            echo. Upon a nation occupying another's country there rests an enormous
                            responsibility: no smaller than that of benefiting the world at large.
                            Is England doing this in the Valley of the Nile to such an extent as to
                            make her displacement here a matter deserving universal regret? We of
                            course would reply that she was, for every nation regards its own acts
                            as better than that of others The point is what is the opinion of those
                            Powers whose opinion is worthy of respect. The answer is clear from the
                            way Europe hits recognized Lord Cromer's work in Egypt with in
                            ungrudging admiration that is ns sincere as it is unanimous. As long as
                            Europe recognizes, as it does to-day, that our occupation is based on
                            the indefeasible tenure of making the best use of the country, there is
                            no need to regard anybody else's opinion in the matter.</p>

                        <p>A meeting of British subjects will be held at the British Club,
                            Alexandria, in the Rue de la Care de Ramleh, at 6 p.m. on Friday to pass
                            a resolution of regret at Lord Cromer's departure from Egypt. Every

                            to assist at this demonstration. It is unnecessary for us to urge our
                            British readers to attend this meeting, for we have received great
                            evidence that the regret at Lord Cromer's departure is as keen among
                            Britishers in Alexandria as it is in the Capital, and indeed throughout
                            Egypt and the Sudan, but we would, like to make a suggestion for a
                            second resolution. As Lord Cromer remarked in his letter to, the

                            Cromer has done in Egypt is, however, none the less because his Lordship
                            has been unable to pay frequent visits to this city, and we would
                            suggest that Iris Lordship should be earnestly petitioned to come to
                            Alexandria before leaving Egypt to attend a mass meeting in which every
                            community of Alexandria should be invited to participate.</p>

                        <head>OPINION AT CONSTANTINOPLE.</head>
                        <p>So far none of the local newspapers at Constantinople have mentioned the
                            resignation of Lord Cromer. This is not surprising in a country like
                            Turkey, where a strict censorship is exercised, but it is noteworthy
                            that one paper today announces the appointment of Sir Eldon Gorst.</p>
                        <p>While the importance of the work accomplished by Lord Cromer in Egypt is
                            fully recognized there, his resignation has been received with
                            Satisfaction in Turkish official circles, as he was regarded as being no
                            friend of Turkey or Turkish interests. Turkish officials, however, do
                            not anticipate any change in British policy in Egypt, and they expect
                            Sir Eldon Gorst to follow in the footsteps of his distinguished
                            predecessor. In diplomatic circles the moment chosen by Lord Cromer for
                            his resignation is considered to be inopportune, in view of the
                            Nationalist agitation in Egypt, it being believed that the promoters of
                            the movement will consider Lord Cromer's retirement to lie due to their
                            campaign, and may therefore endeavor to fan the agitation into renewed
                            activity. The diplomatists here take the view that it would have been
                            preferable if Lord Comer had gone on a long leave of absence and
                            resigned some months hence.</p>

                        <p>The Parisian "Liberte," in its correspondence from London, reviews the
                            career of Sir Eldon Gorst, and discussing his future says: "It is
                            undoubtedly difficult from mere psychological observation to foresee
                            what will &amp; the general policy of such a man. However, if we
                            consider in this connection the painful but still real efforts of Lord

                            advantage impacted to their application. In view of the renewed ardour
                            manifested by the Egyptian Nationalists, the Liberal Government should
                            think of displaying generosity. Is the appointment of Sir Eldon Gorst
                            the expression of some such intention ? The future will show."</p>

                    <p>Yesterday's military demonstration by the. troops of the Army of Occupation
                        has had an excellent effect and the capital has resumed its wonted
                        appearance. It was thought advisable as a precautionary measured*) delay the
                        arrival of the trams on the lines and the traffic only began at 7.30 instead
                        of at 5.30 \.m., as is usually the case. A Cairo newspaper has stated that
                        the Tramway Company has made a claim for L.E. 2,000 from the Egyptian
                        Government for the injury that its property has received at the hands of the
                        mob, but this information is devoid of foundation.</p>
                    <p>The neighbourhood of the Cairo Government yesterday presented its customary
                        appearance and there was no assembly of crowds in the vicinity. The Press
                        indulges in various criticisms against the police. The "Journal da Cairo'
                        remarks: "We must note the unanimity of the newspapers in their declarations
                        on the object of the manifest insufficiency of the Cairo police. We do not
                        think they were in sufficient in point of numbers, but we have not lie
                        official figures before us. The complaints are based on the insufficiency of
                        the measured taken by the police in the case of an event which was
                        anticipated. There is good reason or these complaints and it is to be hoped
                        that nobody will deny this fact. Elsewhere the same Paper remarks that "It
                        is to be regretted that precise orders have been neglected to be given the
                        troops in the case of certain eventualities." *</p>

                        whole affair was engineered for a political object by die Anglo-Egyptian

                        GENERAL MEETING.</head>
                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company (Limited) was held in London last Tuesday, for the purpose of
                        submitting resolutions providing for the transfer of the control of the
                        company to Cairo, and increasing the capital from £250,000 to £500,000.</p>
                    <p>Sir Auckland Colvin, who presided, said the links between the company and the
                        Egyptian Delta Light Railways (Limited), which were severed in July last in
                        view of the proposal to acquire the Egyptian Land and General Trust
                        Company—which proposal fell through— would, by the resolutions now
                        submitted, be reconstituted. The railway company would, as before, continue
                        to have four seats, should it wish to calim them, on the Delta Land Board;
                        but the Land Board, so reconstituted, would in future meet in Cairo instead
                        of London. His colleagues and himself, in agreeing to put the matter before
                        a general meeting in London, had been largely guided by the fact that the
                        majority of the capital invested in this company had been subscribed in
                        Egypt, that there was no Debenture debt held in London, that by far the
                        greater part of the shareholders were resident in Egypt, that the presence
                        of directors of the Light Railways on the Land Board would strengthen the
                        board and that to carry out the enterprise of the peculiarly local and
                        limited nature of the Egyptian Land Company, in the conditions which were
                        necessary to success, the best means of securing the local knowledge and
                        unanimity which were necessary to that end would, in their opinion, be found
                        in the creation of a single board, sitting in Cairo, constituted in the
                        manner proposed.</p>
                    <p>As to the proposed increase of capital, the Land Company had before them a
                        project for acquiring a considerable area of land lying between Cairo and
                        Helouan, in the immediate vicinity*of a valuably and larger tract already
                        acquired by them in previous years. Both properties were known as the Meadi
                        properties. The object of the company was to round off the whole of these
                        two areas and to convert thein into residential properties, in the belief
                        that such sites would be largely in demand by residents in Cairo and that
                        the sale of the several, lots which had been and were being already divided
                        would be of considerable value to thecompany. Some progress had already been
                        made in the sale of sites on the Meadi land previously acquired by the
                        company, and negotiations were now pending with a group who owned the
                        balance of land above referred to for acquiring their property. When he was
                        recently in "Egypt, he inquired personally into the merits of the project,
                        and satisfied himself that, so far as could be ascertained, in the present
                        condition of affairs in Egypt, where much building and land speculation was
                        rife, the Meadi property, which was situated on the Delta Light Railways, a
                        few miles from Cairo, on the line of railway to Helouan, fulfilled the
                        conditions which were necessary to make it a popular suburb of Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The several- resolutions were adopted unanimously.</p>

                        -Advices received this week from the Yemen state that 8ana' and the
                        neighbouring districts are still greatly disturbed and that much fighting is
                        going on in Humdan and Khoulan—two large Turkish districts; but 110 details
                        have been received. The Turks are reported to have destroyed many villages
                        in Humdan belonging to Arab sheikhs who are suspected of giving help to the
                        rebels. The rebels are reported to have cut the telegraph wire between
                        Manakha and Sana (Hodeida route).</p>
                    <p>Fighting is also reported from A1 Haima, a large Turkish district, and its
                        vicinity. The Turks are reported to be in pursuit of the two tribes of Beni
                        Ismail and Beni Namer, who number about 15,000. It is reported that the Imam
                        has proclaimed as traitors all Arabs employed by the Turkish Government as
                        patrols, police and spies, the majority of these being composed of Arabs,
                        and That he has ordered his followers to kill ever}' Arab whom they happen
                        to meet during their raids into Turkish districts.</p>
                    <p>Turkish operations are now confined to their own troubled districts and the
                        districts North- East and North-West of Sana appear to be getting out of

                    <p>Hassan Yahia Ad-Dbuhiani the new Imam, who raised himself some time ago near
                        Sada— a place about 130 miles south of Sana - has at last made a virtue of
                        necessity and joined hands with Mohamed Yahia, the old Imam. With about
                        12,000 followers Ad-Dhuhiani had been for some time claiming to be the
                        rightful Imam in Yemen and had made several unsuccessful attempts to capture
                        Sahara, the old Imam's stronghold. Rumor has it, however, that this
                        combination is the result of the remonstrance of the old Imam with the
                        Dhuhiani on the folly of dissipating their powers amongst themselves and
                        becoming an easy prey to the Turks.</p>
                    <p>There are now at Hodeida about 5,000 time-expired Rediff, who have returned
                        from Sana and other Turkish places in the Yemen. They are reported to have
                        been waiting there for about two months for a transport ship to take them to
                        their homes, but no steamer has been procured for them as yet. They
                        threatened at one time to cut off the Hodeida water supply which comes from
                        the interior, and looted goods from shops at Hodeida, whereupon the people
                        closed their shops for three days. 'The Pasha has been telegraphing for some
                        time for transport ships, but in vain. The expenditure incurred in feeding
                        these troops for two months would have been enough to charter a big steamer
                        to take them to Beyrout, mast of them being Syrians.</p>

                    <p>SKRVIA'S IMPORTATIONS.</p>
                    <p>The import of Servian cattle into Egypt is expected to gradually assume
                        important dimensions and there is every reason to believe that Servia is
                        destined to be the great supplier of cattle for the Egyptian market. This
                        trade has only lately developed through the political boycotting of Servia
                        by Austria, which led to 1 commercial boycott of that country's imports.
                        Servia was thus forced to look for other markets and the result has been
                        that some observant people at 'Belgrade considered that Egypt would afford a
                        suitable outlet for Servian cattle. That country is purely agricultural and
                        has a fine stock of some of the best cattle in Europe. The Servian cattle
                        show clear signs of Herefordshire crossing. They give good meat and the
                        country, as far as we know, is free from the plague and other contagious
                        diseases to which cattle are subject. Up *> now the transit has been by way
                        of Salonica. Unfortunately, the Macedonian port is infected with cattle
                        plague so the animals cannot be brought into the interior of Egypt. This
                        draw- back could he entirely obviated if the dealers could being them down
                        the Danube to the Slack Sea ports whence they could be taken direct to
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>There is a great and growing market for cattle in Egypt, where, owing to the
                        prosperity if the country, the native is becoming a meat-eater instead of
                        being content with a vegetable diet as heretofore. Syria and Asia Minor are
                        permanently infected countries and he import into Egypt of cattle from these
                        countries has fallen off considerable of late.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Nationalists have been lately taken under the protecting wing of
                        the Aborigines Protection Society, which hitherto has confined its
                        attentions to Negros and savages. The secretary of this society continues to
                        issue pamphlets in Egypt and we hope for the sake of the society that its
                        funds are being considerably increased as a consequence by the grateful
                        leaders of the Nationalist*, The latest pamphlet* suggests the necessity for
                        the departure of the Army of Occupation. We extract the following paragraph
                        from the conclusion of this publication: —</p>
                    <p>As has already been urged, moreover, the British Army of Occupation has long
                        since served all the useful purpose possible to it If the "new political
                        institution" that Lord Dufierin thought had been "created" by the- organic
                        Law promulgated at his instigation in* May, 1883, have not yet been allowed
                        to take' shape the blame lies with the "benevolent despotism" assorted by
                        the British Agent and Consul-General, and symbolized by the British Army of
                        Occupation. Earl Granville in November, 1882, while promising that "the
                        British occupation should last for as short a time as possible," stipulated
                        that it should continue "until the administration of affairs has been'
                        reconstructed on a basis which will afford satisfactory guarantees for the
                        maintenance of peace, order, and prosperity in Egypt, and for fulfilment of
                        obligations towards foreign Powers." Much remains to be done before it can
                        he claimed that the administration, of affairs in Egypt is in a healthy
                        condition.. But all the guarantees that the British occupation is competent
                        to afford either for internal peace,, order, and prosperity, or for
                        fulfilment of foreign obligations, have been secured; and whatever remains
                        to be achieved will have a far better chance of accomplishment if the Army
                        of Occupation is withdrawn than if it remains. This Array of Occupation
                        contributes in no way whatever to the, wellbeing of the country. On the
                        other hand, rightly or wrongly regarded as a symbol of conquest or
                        annexation, it is nothing but an annoyance to all right-minded] Egyptians,
                        an 1 is too often an incentive to disorderly conduct among the less
                        law-abiding members of the community. Nothing but good could follow its
                        withdrawal.</p>

                    <p>Our Port Sudan Correspondent writes:- The cotton crop in Tokar this yeat is
                        quite unprecendent. It is reckoned that it will amount to about 90,000 small
                        cantars, which is the double of last year's erop. Prices, however, are
                        keeping very high, owing to stronf competition, there being a rush of
                        European and native merchants on the spot this season. Suakin is very lively
                        just now on account of the large quanitites of cotton coming up from Tokar,
                        and every empty space on the beach is filled u with bags and bales of cotton
                        awaiting shipment. </p>

                    <p>Professor II. F. Osborne, vice president of the Museum of Natural History at
                        New York, who left New York on January 5^ on a three months' exploring
                        expedition in the Fayoum to seek the ancestor of the elephant, has returned
                        to America.</p>
                    <p>The members of the party who are still in the Fayoum are stimulated by the
                        hope that the much desired skulls of these mammals may be found. Skulls are,
                        however, very rare. Two skulls of the Paloeomastodon are reported to have
                        been found by a collector who did not understand how to preserve them. Six
                        skulls of the Arsinoitherium have been secured in former years; three of
                        these, all very perfect, are in the Cairo Museum, one in the British Museum,
                        a fifth in the Stuttgart Museum, a sixth, said to be the largest and finest,
                        was destroyed in transit. Of these six skulls four were found in surface
                        prospects and two by quarrying. The region, however, has been so thoroughly
                        prospected since 1901 that the chances of easily securing fine surface
                        prospects are very remote.</p>

                    <head>DEVELOPMENT OF PORT SOUDAN.</head>
                    <p>RIVAL TRADE CENTRES.</p>
                    <p>The first Consular report has just been received from Port Soudan. Its
                        future, it seems, depends entirely on its importance as a port of entry and
                        forwarding station. For these purposes it has already superseded Suakin, but
                        the old town will die hard, if it dies at all. The pilgrim traffic to Jeddah
                        will always pass through it—this year the number of pilgrims expected is
                        about 8,000—and as a native centre it is likely to maintain its position.
                        The lower classes go over to Port Soudan to work, but they return to Suakin
                        to spend their earnings. There are a number of families—merchants, sheiks,
                        etc.—who have lived for generations in Suakin, and there they will remain.
                        The merchants arc sending their sons, however, to Port Soudan to start a
                        branch of their business there. Next, the quantity of cotton which is grown
                        at Tokar is considerable, and is increasing. Last year 60,000 cantars of
                        ungunned cotton were produced, and this year over 80,000 cantars are
                        expected. This cotton is sent down to Trinkitat, whence it is carried by the
                        boat to Suakin.</p>
                    <p>The cotton which is grown at Kassala is also, at present, sent down to Suakin
                        by caravan. A ginning factor}' was recently established, but proved a
                        failure. The cotton is exported from Suakin to Egypt and is mixed with the
                        Egyptian produce. It is, moreover, not impossible that with the future
                        development of the country, Suakin may become a cotton centre of some
                        importance. It is also, at present, the seat of a trade in cattle with
                        Erithrea, Abyssinia and the adjacent districts, though this traffic has been
                        subject to great hindrance lately owing to the prevalence of cattle
                        plague.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Port Sudan is already at the head of a road running to (1)
                        Atbara, 305 miles; (2) Khartoum, 190 miles beyond Atbara; (3) Kareima, 312
                        miles beyond Atbara; (4) Wady Haifa, 388 miles beyond Atbara. Other railways
                        are already projected, and with every yard that is built the importance of
                        that harbour increases It inevitably becomes the outlet not only for the
                        immense territories of the Sudan, but also for a great part of Abyssinia as
                        well as the Congo State. Goods for the Congo already pass that way, and the
                        material for the Congo-Nile Railway which is now being surveyed will do the
                        same. With the prosperity of the Sudan, exports are gradually and steadily
                        increasing, and there are doubtless many legitimate enterprises which are
                        only awaiting development</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE</head>
                    <p>LA PLUS FAIBLE.</p>
                    <p>in this piece the actors appeared, one and all, at their best The play is a
                        most interesting exposition of psychology, and perhaps the finest work in it
                        is the presentment of Angelique, the virtuous wife and sister. This was
                        faultlessly and admirably given by Mme Danville. Her expression and
                        demeanour were thoroughly admirable. M. Leverin as young Nerval was, for
                        once, entirely natural, and showed his real power Mme Marie-Lauire, as his
                        mother, was also admirable. The careful and thorough study, evident in all
                        she does, resulted in a most vivid presentment of motherly love and feminine
                        sympathy, carrying all, even family years and prejudices before it, to
                        ensure the happiness of her well-loved son. M. de Feraudy, as usual, was
                        Louis Gourd and and no one else! Devoted in happiness as in misfortune,
                        unable to believe the nervous inspired suspicions of Nerval, furious whence
                        could no longer close his eyes thereto—the quarrel was a great scene greatly
                        played—and at last, forgiving and again, as ever, devoted. Mile Van Doren ns
                        Germaine de Mancombe crowned the success of the whole piece. Her attempt to
                        see her wounded lover and her hopeless misery when the virtuous family drove
                        her away, were a master piece, real and moving. And her final reconciliation
                        was equally vivid and touching. Her eyes, her hands her whole self-spoke of
                        her distress, love, and forgiveness, arresting and. eloquent. It is a fine
                        play, and the actors did it the fullest possible justice.</p>

                    <head>BLANCHETTE.</head>
                    <p>"Blanchette," a slight enough play in some respects, is interesting in that
                        it gives a certain not uncommon aspect of French life, the well-to-do
                        peasant exploiting his children. Old Rousset has his daughter well educated
                        in the hope that she may become a teacher, and when she fails, he naturally
                        expects her to make herself useful otherwise, to marry the wheelwright's
                        son, or, if she won't do that, at least to help in the inn. Her disgust, her
                        flight to Paris, her return, vanquished, to yield to the kindly
                        solicitations of young Morillon, form the rest of the play. It certainly
                        showed M. de Ferandy in a novel light, and as certainly he proved his worth
                        in every least detail. Mile Van Doren was very excellent, but seemed if
                        anything more superior to her surroundings than she should be: that is of
                        course, the keynote of the part, but she forced it a trifle. Mme Marie-Laure
                        was admirably natural as Mme Rousset. The other had small parts, but played
                        creditably enough. The play has its momentary suggestion, but the tame
                        ending and the lack of any great depth or emotion militate against the
                        production of any very vivid impression, and except for certain moments does
                        not give scope for great acting. </p>
                    <p>MONSEIGNEUR.</p>
                    <p>M. de Feraudy appeared, for the last time, on Thursday night in
                        "Monseigneur"—a short curtain-raiser, —- and "L'Avare." Moliere is, alas,
                        just a little trying on a khamseen night! —is fun is of course as great and
                        varied as ever, but the few serious parts seemed a shade more formal and
                        stiff, calling for some effort—which, under climatic conditions, was trying.
                        This seemed to affect the actors as well, to some degree.</p>
                    <p>Mile. Van Doren and Mr. Bourdel especially were inclined to rush their parts.
                        M. de Feraudy himself, as Harpaguo, was delightful. It is under such
                        leadership as his and that of Mme Marie Laure (Frosine) that one realizes
                        how admirable Moliere really is. They brought out every point and showed in
                        its fullness. the wit anti dramatic power of the famous play. The "sans dot"
                        passage was splendid. Old Harpagou/s rapture at such a prospect to which he
                        recurs and recurs, quite regardless of all else, was beyond praise. – M.
                        Severin acted very well. He, and in common -with Feraudy and Mme.
                        Marie-Laure, realised the meaning of the parts and the play. This seemed to
                        escape the notice of the other younger actors Naturally enough Moliere is a
                        contrast to modern French drama, the latter is serious, and absolutely
                        natural, from life, the former is more dramatic, full of special situations
                        and requiring special and possibly more elaborate attention—one has to
                        assume a certain frame of mind for it The lesser parts were fairly well
                        rendered, and M. Gournac was quite good as La Fleche.</p>
                    <p>Well, now that M. de Feraudy has left us, the theatrical season is
                        practically over and we must await the fortunes of the 1907-8 winter. Mme
                        Rejane may honour us with a visit again under M. Chimene's direction. We
                        must hope that we have found favour in M. Chiemene's eyes, and that we may
                        preserve that favour: it may mean many more delightful visits from the
                        greater representatives of the finest school of drama in Europe.</p>

                    <p>MINIEH SPRING MEETING.</p>
                    <p>A south wind and 106° in the shade seemed .unpropitious enough for the
                        closing meeting of the Minieh Sporting Club on the 19th April, but good
                        sport and enthusiasm were sufficient to overcome all obstacles, with the
                        result of a most successful afternoon's racing The course was in good
                        condition and the stands well filled. The English community turned out in
                        great force. The moudir, Mustapha Bey Maher, Omar Bey Sultan, Abdel Hamid
                        Bey Abaya, Nashib Bey Hanna, Omar Bey Kishar and many other well-known
                        people were present when racing commenced at 3 45 p.m., the time of the
                        opening event having been changed to 3.30 p m. on account of the
                        weathing.</p>
                    <p>The first race resulted in the victory of an outsider, the favourite having
                        bolted and completed the course before the starting flag fell It was a bad
                        day for favourites as three out of the five races fell to outsiders. The
                        Mudirench Stakes fell, to Hindia, a racing looking mare owned by, Ibrahim
                        Bey Tarraf, Dongola being a fair second. The Maronr Bracelet proved
                        unsatisfactory owing to the small number of entries, but a good race
                        resulted, Mr. Ireland riding the winner, the property of Mr. Papadopoulo.
                        The fourth race produced a most exciting finish, as after the winner about
                        six horses came in almost locked together. The final Stakes resulted in an
                        easy win for Hindia.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently a meeting as held at Omar Bey Sultan's house when the club was
                        formally initialed. Omar Bey Sultan has most generously given The club the
                        permanent use of his I race course, and before next season many:
                        improvements will have been affected, which will add considerably to the
                        comfort of members and spectators, Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun has consented
                        to become patron of the Club, which should do much for horse breeding and

                    <p>When the appetite sickens, and the most excellent food has little or no taste
                        or even seems nausea, other and more serious symptoms will quickly develop.
                        For these are the first indications of a distressed stomach and feeble
                        digestive powers; In the case of Mr. Amedee Weber a talented chef, residing
                        at 53, Dean-lane, Bedminster, Bristol, digestive troubles reduced Him to an
                        invalid, robbed him of all strength and rendered him unable to touch solid
                        food; yet Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People restored his appetite,
                        invigorated his digestive organs, and gave him renewed strength by making
                        Good Red Blood. Mr. Weber stated; -_</p>
                    <p>"My affliction commenced with a feeling of heaviness and languor, but I tried

                        this depressing fatigue. I had no appetite, and thought nothing of missing
                        some meals altogether. Then I found that even after a light meal a
                        distressing fullness, with a feeling of sickness, made me. <floatingText>

                        increased, and soon after taking food I was doubled up by pains in my chest
                        and stomach, so weak had my digestion become. Various medicines were tried,
                        one after another; still my troubles defied treatment, and I became nervous,
                        weak. and irritable. No man could have felt more wretched. For months I
                        swallowed hardly enough to keep me alive; my stomach simply revolted against
                        food, solid or liquid, and the lightest diet was rejected after hours of
                        torture</p>
                    <p>"Through this starvation I lost w-eight and grew so haggard that everybody
                        said I was going into consumption. -Then 1 was examined by two doctors, who
                        said that my only chance of a cure w-as to go away for a change and special
                        treatment. At last the symptoms became so acute that I was in torture night
                        and day, and the medical men warned me that my state was most critical.</p>
                    <p>"At this critical time my wife happened to read a book describing cures by
                        Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and she persuaded me to try these
                        pills as a last chance. To please her I did, and much to my surprise, I
                        found, after a while, that my pains were not nearly so acute, and I felt
                        brighter. Then my appetite revived, and I could take a little solid food
                        without suffering My strength began steadily to return, and as the pills
                        were continued I felt like a man again! I picked up in weight, lost the
                        dreadful consumptive appearance, and in place of feeling weary and
                        depressed, was active and fit for duty at any time. To-day I have a healthy
                        appetite and sound digestion. Since my cure by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills life
                        has become a pleasure again." </p>
