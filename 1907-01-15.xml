                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE HOME PRESS ON EGYPTS PROSPERITY. </head>
                    <p>In a leading article on the growing prosperity of Egypt shown in the note of
                        Sir Vincent Corbett, the "Manchester Courier" says: The strongly-worded
                        expressions of satisfaction with the economie record of Egypt during 1906
                        will be a cause of general satisfaction. In particular, we are glad to note
                        his reference to the large amount of the cotton crop and his opinion that
                        the estimate of next year's surplus of revenue over expenditure at over half
                        a million sterling is a cautious one, Commenting on tho startling fact that
                        since 1900 the relation of exports to imports has changed from an excess of
                        three-and-a-half millions to the very reverse, Sir Vincent Corbett says that
                        "even if these figures imply that Egypt has been paying for her imports with
                        funds advanced by the foreign capitalist, there is nothing necessarily
                        alarming in the fact, so long as the capital in question is employed for the
                        purpose of remunerative enterprise." This is a valuable caution in view of
                        the fact that since the financial controversy turned every man into a
                        political economist, each amateur of the science has the strong feeling that
                        no nation can be prosperous whose imports exceed its exports--an economic
                        generalisation which requires, like every other economic dictum, to be
                        qualified in view of any particular case. Thus in Japan the gold borrowed
                        during the war has been the cause of unexampled energy in business,
                        Increased capital enables industries for which the country offers natural
                        facilities to be developed to their utmost extent, easily paying the
                        interest on what has been borrowed. In the case of Egypt it is the
                        development of cotton-grow. ing that has attracted the additional capital,
                        four million exported from England in October to pay for the crop being
                        responsible for the excess of imports over exports, and incidentally for the
                        rise in the Bank of England rate. Egypt's demand for gold is an annual
                        occurrence. rence, as there is an extreme reluctance on the part of the
                        native cultivator "to accept anything but actual coin in payment of his
                        cotton" and Sir Vincent Corbett's caution is extremely valuable since a
                        combination of other circumstances having necessitated the rise of the Bank
                        rate to 6 per cent. men's attention was drawn to the state of Egyptian
                        finance, with the result that apprehension was expressed in some quarters.
                        Sir Vincent Corbett accordingly: emphasises the fact that "the recent demand
                        was a purely trade demand, and was in no way connected with the financing of
                        speculativo operations." When we remember that there has been a rapid
                        increase, of late years, in the prosperity of Egypt it is likewise
                        permissible to hope that the pessimism in estimating next year's revenue
                        will not be justified. The cotton crop, which is of the utmost importance to
                        this country as well as to Egypt, still depends very much on the vagaries of
                        the River Nile, and it is urgently necessary that large sums bo rendered
                        available for the construction of irrigation and other public works. It is
                        accordingly, particularly to be deplored that the Denshawai Incident of last
                        year has rendered necessary a permanent charge of nearly fifty thousand
                        pounds a year for the reinforced British.</p>

                            "African World" at the modest price of 2s., is well nigh indispensable.
                            Every part of this vast continent finds a place in this bulky
                            publication, and one of the most prominent is Egypt, which has many
                            interesting and instructive articles devoted to it, accompanied by
                            numerous excellent illustrations. Indeed, "Egypt in 1906"'is one of the
                            special features of a work which is oram full of notable contributions
                            of the most up-to-date character. A large portion is concerned with
                            South African mining, about which readers will find much exceedingly
                            useful information, but in the 300 odd pages which the annual containing
                            space is found for dealing effectively with every portion of Africa. The
                            get-up and illustrations are simply superb, and Mr. Leb Weintbal and Mr.

                    <p>The native press is still occupied with the doings of Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.
                        P., who slept at Burma on Sunday and was yesterday at Jantah. "Al Abram ''
                        says :Mr. Robertson, M.P., is travelling in Egypt as a private gentleman.
                        Every Egyptian is yearning to see him, and is eager to offer every possible
                        service relative to the object he has in view. But he is studying the
                        conditions of this country alone, undisturbed by the controversies of the
                        newspapers or the selfish aims of other people. When the Egyptian pronounces
                        the name of Robertson 'a happy smile can be seen playing around his lips. If
                        we cannot approach this M P., in order to bring our complaints to him,
                        fearing lest the useful aims which he has in view will thereby be booked, we
                        can nevertheless tell the English that we love and esteem Mr. Robertson, for
                        the Egyptians do not dislike the English, but they do dislike to see some of
                        their officials attacking the sentiments of the natives in England, where
                        Egyptian public opinion and aspirations are held of no account. The
                        Egyptians respect Mr. Robertson not because he has promised to remove the
                        British Occupation from the Nile Valley, nor because he can counter to his
                        conntrymen's opinions, but because he showed his great sympathy for Egypt in
                        the House of Commons, and his conviction is that the people of Egypt hold
                        opinions and possess rights which should not be trampled on. The Egyptians
                        like Mr. Robertson because he has spoken the truth. The Anglo-Egyptian here
                        could have been similarly esteemed by the natives if only they had adopted
                        the same policy as Mr. Robertson. The Egyptians I will never be content with
                        the Occupation as long as they remain Egyptians. When the occupants of Egypt
                        consider the natives as the real owners of Egypt then they will be esteemed
                        by the natives. The nation I will never forget its political rights, however
                        much it may owe to the occupants for their improvement in the financial
                        state of the country. Egypt wants to be independent.</p>

                        Cairo, continues to display a praiseworthy activity. He only returned to
                        Paris on Thursday week from New York, and at once started off to Egypt. He
                        stayed forty-eight hours in Paris, and spent most of that time answering
                        letters, which so tired him that he was too fatigued even to go to the Opera
                        to see "Ariane," Massanet's last chef d'ænvre. The veteran composer will be
                        in Egypt for a few weeks' well earned repose. At the end of February he is
                        in Monte Carlo to superintend the production of "Timbre d'Argent," and a
                        month later he will return to Paris. He is very much pleased with his recent
                        tour in America. President Roosevelt gave him a charming reception, and in
                        all the large cities he was delighted to find audiences who loved
                        music-especially French music--and who listened to it with a soul and with
                        religion. Shortly after M. Saint Saens left Havre on his way to New York, he
                        was taken so ill with an angina that at one time grave fears were
                        entertained as to the result. During his stay in Cairo he will be the guest
                        of Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha. </p>

                    <head>THE INDIAN MAILS.<lb/>THE TRANSIT THROUGH EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Correspondence has passed recently between the British Chamber of Commerce of
                        Egypt and Lord Cromer on the subject of the acceleration of the Indian
                        mails. It is satisfactory to note that his Lordship has kindly consented to
                        move in the matter. Writing to Lord Cromer on the 9th December last, Mr. H.
                        P. Kingham, president of the Chamber, said : "At the request of my
                        committee, I have the honour to draw your Lordship's attention to the
                        question of the transit of the Indian mails through Egypt. The chief
                        obstacle pot forward in the past against the transit overland from
                        Alexandria to Suez was the risk of inconvenience by quarantine-especially at
                        Suez-owing to the frequency of plague or cholera in India. It is, however,
                        well recognised, especially since the Anglo-French agreement, that the
                        imposition of quarantine is much less frequent, and less severe, than was
                        the case in years past. Further, it has become a custom in Europe, on
                        occasions, to run trains in quarantine through an entire country. This, my
                        committee suggests, could be done in Egypt, and that obstacle, therefore,
                        has not the importance that it had formerly. </p>
                    <p>"My committee desires to emphasise the gain in time in the delivery of mail
                        that would be affected by the overland transit. The mail steamer from
                        Brindisi now reaches Port Said each Wednesday morning by boat. 6 o'clock.
                        The same steamer could reach Alexandria, owing to the shorter voyage, at
                        about 6 o'clock on Tuesday evening. As the Egyptian Railways run on to the
                        quays at Alexandria, a train could be waiting alongside ready to receive
                        mail and passengers ; the latter would then be carried directly to Suez,
                        reaching there at an early hour on Wednesday morning. The mails would thus
                        be put on board the East going steamer at Suez at the same time that they
                        are now put on board the same steamer at Port Said. By this means, India and
                        the Far East - would have their mails expedited by the adoration of the
                        steamer's passage through the Suez y Capel, which represents some 24 hours. </p>
                    <p>The gain to Egypt would be as follows: In Cairo, at present, the mails are
                        delivered some time on Wednesday afternoon, whereas if dispatched from
                        Alexandria they would be distributed by the first delivery on Wednesday
                        morning. In Alexandria, the mails now arrive at about 8 o'clock on Wednesday
                        evening, and are distributed by the first delivery on Thursday morning,
                        whereas if landed on Tuesday, evening they would be distributed by the first
                        delivery on Wednesday morning : a full 24 hours could thus be gained by the
                        commercial community in Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The commerce of Alexandria (which means the greater part of the commerce as
                        of the whole of Egypt) has become so extensive and important that
                        acceleration of the mails would be of considerable activity.</p>
                    <p>"My committee gratefully recognises the efforts which your Lordship has made
                        comparatively recently in the above matter, but, at the same time, ventures
                        to hope that you may see the expediency of re-opening the question."</p>
                    <p>To the above communication Lord Cromer b replied :</p>
                    <p>"I am receipt of your letter of the 19th instant on the sobject of the
                        transit of the mails through Egypt. I propose to send this communication to
                        London. I may, however, remark that when this question was fully examined
                        some while ago, my impression is that It was found that taking into account
                        the delays which would be caused by an addition transhipment of the mails,
                        the saving of time would be a good deal less than 24 hours."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Ernest H. Crosby, whose death was announced last week, was born in 1856,
                        and was the son of the Rev. Howard Crosby, the well-known Presbyterian
                        minister of New York. In 1887 he became a member of the New York Assembly,
                        but in two years became disgusted with politics, and was in 1889 nominated
                        by President Harrison and appointed by the Khedive American Judge of the
                        International Tribunal of First Instance at Alexandria, ln 1894 he resigned,
                        and on his way home came under the influence of Count Tolstoy, with whom he
                        stayed for some time and continued in frequent correspondence. On his return
                        to America he bought an estate-Grasmere-alto Rhinebeck, on the Hudson River,
                        and carried out as far as possible his Tolstoyan ideas by profase and
                        perhaps indiscriminate charity to any and every one who appealed to him. He
                        identified himself with socials in reform and the Anti Imperialist League,
                        advocating both in speeches and in numerous publications almost anarchical
                        principles with a geniality which disarmed criticism but never concealed his
                        absolute Sincerity and his intense humanitarian sympathie. At the time of
                        the Cleveland Message on the Venezuelan question he estranged many friends
                        in America by his violent protests in support of England, and a few years
                        later he used language as strong to denounce England's action in South
                        Africa. He was a man of extremes, but every wild opinion he professed was
                        based on the highest motives, and in every little act he practised what he
                        preaches. He declined to insure his life because he said, "If I die young I
                        defraud the company ; if I live long they defraud me. It is betting in its
                        most aggravated form." Mr. Crosby married Fanny. a daughter of Mr. H. F.
                        Schefilio, of New York, who, with a son and a daughter, survives him.</p>

                        its first production; its many and sublime qualities have since found their
                        justification in more than a quarter of a century's unstinted praise. If
                        there is too great a penchant toward the spectacular, thus to a certain
                        extent limiting scope for individual effort, there is more than ample
                        compensation in the colour, the passion, the grace, the humor with which
                        work is conceived. It is remarkable what variety of subject-matter has been
                        employed and with what harmonious contrast it has been blended. There is the
                        famous Hungarian march, perhaps the most striking number of the opera, and
                        certainly, last night, the be executed; there is the church choir; the lusty
                        drinking songs; the delicate ballet; the Latin chorus, which should have
                        been sung by students and not soldiers : they cannot all be Dick Steeler;
                        then follows the quaint ballad of the King of Thule at length the whirling
                        finale. It is a wealth, a breadth, a sincerity of music that well-nigh
                        baffles description Happily, the rendering last night was in the main
                        extremely good; it was as if far. greater pain had been taken then at any
                        previous production, and the result must have been gratifying to those
                        responsible therefore The front fell upon Sig. Zacconi, who led his
                        orchestra with considerable spirit and earned for them. The chorus too
                        showed a marked improvement and surpassed the most sanguine expectations ;
                        they were, so to speak, trained to the mivat and sang with correctness and
                        an aplom which were most commendable. We cannot say as much for the
                        principals. Sig. Marouli (Faust) was colourless and his voice lacked timbre,
                        nor was Signor Berriel's singing very "simpatico," but his Mefistofele wa
                        handicapped by Sig. Walter's recent achievement. Signa. Grisi made a
                        credible Margherita, but she has an ominous tremolo. The rapture with which
                        the ballet was hailed was quite disproportionate to its merite, though 'twas
                        well enough executed, and the "Silfi Volanti' ' exceeded in looking pleasant
                        and obviously trying. Considerable pain was evidently given to the setting,
                        but the end far from justified the means : one of the waits lasted well
                        beyond half an hour, and we are bound to say the forbearance of the house
                        was more to be pitied than admired. For ourselves, the opera's title
                        afforded us a refuge.</p>

                        has ever been more violently assaulted by "Al Lawa": than Gallini Pasha
                        (except Arabi Pasha the present Ministers, Sayed El Bakri, Sheikh Ali
                        Youssef, Risz Pasha, Skander Pasha Fehmy, the owners of "Al Mokattam," the
                        Syrians and Baropeans, Lord Cromer, and M. Hanotaux). But how in the world
                        did he become a friend of Mustapha and a founder of his company? The problem
                        is amazingly hard to solve. Some pretend that, like Payek Pasha, Haris
                        Pasha, and Ferid Bey, Gallini Pasha, once out of office, forgot all but
                        vengeance. The English baye dropped him, and so be pardong Mostapha for his
                        little Daughtinesses and seeks to turn the tables on those wretches, the
                        occupants But I cannot believe this explanation, for he is A very paragon of
                        amiability and-gallantry No Egyptians has a better taste in dress and
                        parfemy for he is an expert in the recognition of the charms of the European
                        fair. Daring pure brief winter you will infallibly see him with one or two
                        of these charming creatures. He offers them bouquets, amuses them, shows
                        them the sights of Cairo. He thus proves his perfect knowledge of European
                        civilisation. So I am muoh surprised to find him in Mustapha' company. He
                        should have spent the money on saying bouquets for the charming denized of
                        Shepheard's. That would have been fa nora reasonable, for, while pleasant
                        feminine society is the ornament of life that every man of sentiment should
                        long for, the "Egyptian Standard" is a tax upon the patience of the most
                        long-suffering.</p>

                        the 3rd Coldstreams, was known as Lord NewtownButler before he succeeded his

                        and be is married to a soldier's daughter, Lady Lanesborough, who became his
                        wife sixteen years ago, being the | eldest daughter of that fiue old warrior
                        the | late Major-General Sir Henry Tombs, who won the Victoria Cross before

                            <p>It is officially stated that, despite the famine expenditure of
                                80,000,000 roubles, the surplus for 1906 amounts to 213,000,000
                                roubles, 158,000,000 of which wipes out the deficit of 1906. It is
                                estimated that the deficit of 1907 will amount to 297,000,000
                                roubles, of which 55,000,000 will be coverable by the surplus of
                                1906, and the rest by new loan. The estimates include 124,000,000
                                roubles, which go towards the cost of the Japanese war, and
                                1,000,000 for famine relief. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>THE CAPITULATIONS.</p>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                        <p>Sir, -In yesterday's issue of the "Egyptian, Gazette" I noticed the
                            following suggestive piece of information :</p>
                        <p>At its last meeting the Committee of the Italian Chamber of Commerce
                            discussed the proposals of the Earl of Cromer relating to the
                            suppression of the Capitulations. Al proces verbal of the meeting was
                            subsequently drawn up and forwarded to the Italian Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs. The Chamber, while recognising the good work accomplished by
                            Great Britain in Egypt, is unfavorable to change the status quo, as it
                            considers that in their present state the natives are unfit to be
                            entrusted with the security of foreigners in the country.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that this information is correct it must be inferred that it
                            would have been wiser policy on the part of the Italian Chamber of
                            Commerce to attach a proviso to their conclusion. Every European in
                            Egypt would view with horror and dismay the prospect of handing over to
                            the native authorities the legal rights and privileges be possessed in
                            virtue of the Capitulations. But in Lord Cromer's report for 1904 he
                            suggested that "the Powers should transfer to Great Britain the
                            legislative foundations they now collectively possess." There is
                            therefore no need for Europeans to fear that their legal rights will be
                            placed at the tender mercies of the native, and the action of the
                            members of the Chamber would have been wiser if they had inserted a
                            stipulation to the effect that provided Great Britain would give a
                            guarantee of the permanent nature of her occupation of Egypt they would
                            be willing to reconsider their decision. If, as Lord Cromer says, Great
                            Britain absorbs the Capitulations or, in other words, if the
                            Capitulations are vested in the occupying Power, that would be an
                            excellent solution. But both the English and foreign members of the
                            European community in Egypt are perfectly justified in asking Great
                            Britain to declare the permanency of her position here, and I maintain
                            that until Great Britain does so no person who now enjoys the privileges
                            of the Capitulations, will be willing to transfer them to that Power.
                            This is the crux of the situation, for the only valid reason why we
                            should agree to forego the rights we now possess in virtue of the
                            Capitulations, is that in exchange for our so doing the occupying Power
                            should formally notify the Power having Capitulations that her
                            occupation of Egypt is to be henceforth considered permanent and that
                            all these Powers concur in the permanency, of her position in Egypt.
                            There is no other solution to the difficulty, and I venture to state
                            that my opinion is shared by every European, Englishmen included, with
                            whom I have discussed the subject I am, etc.</p>

                        <p>THE SERVANT QUESTIONS IN EGYPT </p>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir, --The letter from "An Old Resident" calls attention to a serious and
                            growing evil, which I, and doubtless a number of other residents, would
                            like to see remedied. The present difficulty in obtaining honest and
                            satisfactory servants is not confined to the humbler and less effluent
                            members of the European community, but is experienced also, though in a
                            less degree, by those households who are ready to pay higher wages. The
                            servants, however, have become so exorbitant in their demands, and the
                            majority of them are so incompetent, that I think most of the residents
                            would be glad to see some early steps taken to obviate those
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>I quite agree with all the remarks of "An Old Resident" as to the
                            worthlessness of the existing so-called registry offices, which
                            Government authorities may be satisfied with as a solution of the
                            question, but which in no sense satisfy the public, who endeavour to
                            engage their servants through the nears of these offices. As a rule, as
                            your correspondent says, the scum of the servant class are offered for
                            engagement, and frequently, if one is obtained who can fulfil his duties
                            in a possibly satisfactory manner, the sheikh of the registry office
                            trades on him by inducing him to leave one place to go to another, and
                            so increase his registration fees.</p>
                        <p>The scarcity also of available satisfactory servante annually becomes
                            greater owing to the increasing influx of residents of all
                            nationalities, including wealthy relatives, into the towns of Cairo and
                            Alexandria and the difficulties experienced by trusted servants whom one
                            sends in search of another to replace a servant discharged or who leaves
                            of his own accord, proves that the demand is far greater than the
                            supply. The large number of hotels also employ a considerable percentage
                            of those available, and do not experience the same troubles, as
                            servants, owing to the lavish tipping system, generally prefer a winter
                            hotel engagement and an idle summer to regular employment in a
                            household.</p>
                        <p>I fear I have not much hope of a solution of the question in the
                            anggestion of "An O.d Resident" to petition the Government to establish
                            an official registry office, as such questions are usually considered
                            one of secondary importance and receive but scanty and tardy attention,
                            though, of course, if a sufficiently powerful and urgent movement were
                            organized, it might in a measure attain the desired results. The fact
                            remains, however, that the supply is unequal to the demand.</p>
                        <p>I should like, however, to see such a movement made, in the hopes of the
                            establishment of an official Government registry office properly
                            organized for native servants.</p>
                        <p>I would, though, make a further suggestion, the success of which would
                            probably be more easily and sooner realized, and that is that the
                            European residents should support a scheme to introduce Goanese
                            servants, I have no personal experience of them, beyond those I have
                            seen employed on the passenger steamers, but I am given to understand by
                            those who know them that most are excellent servants, the results of
                            generations of training, the supply is very large, and the wages less
                            exorbitant than those now prevailing here. A registry office could
                            easily be established in Cairo and Alexandria under the superintendent
                            of suitable managers, with a reliable correspondent in Bombay to select
                            and send over as many as are required. By this means the resident would
                            know where to turn when a servant was wanted, and would obtain one of
                            much more experienced and satisfactory nature, -I am, etc.,</p>

                    <p>Football At Port Said</p>
                    <p>Our Port Said Correspondent writes:</p>
                    <p>Port Said International Club played their first match against the Government
                        School on Saturday afternoon in the ground of the former. It resulted in a
                        win for the natives by 2 goals to one. Port Said started and after desperate
                        give-and-take play they assumed the aggressive. Their forwards played
                        grandly and looked like having things their own way, but they shot feebly,
                        and with the half gale which was blowing across field they lost many
                        chances. A long kick by the Arabs right full back which was badly missed and
                        found touch near Port Said's line, brought the relief of his side wanted. A
                        smart dribble by the Arab forwards took play to the mouth of the goal and
                        Port Said had a very anxious time, but relief was obtained. Shortly after
                        this the natives got a rather soft goal, from an off-side man. From the
                        kick-off play was on the touch line for a while, but just before time the
                        Arabs put in another goal, which was if anything more off-side than the
                        last. </p>
                    <p>The second half can hardly be described as a pleasant one, owing to some
                        rather dirty play, the Arab goalkeeper and left back being very "hot". Port
                        Said attacked from beginning to end and certainly had very hard lines in not
                        scoring more than the one they did, but their forwards, with the exception
                        of Field and Ingram, were very weak and I think one could say funky/ Wallace
                        played well at full back in which position I would much prefer to see him
                        play than in goal. Port Said would benefit greatly with a little
                        practice.</p>
                    <p>Football in the Provinces</p>
                    <p>Our Tala Correspondent writes: A football match was played on Friday between
                        the pupils of Tantah and Damanhour Government schools. The match was
                        witnessed by a large crowd of spectators. Kick-off was at 3:25 p.m and the
                        teams defended their sides admirably, the match ended in a draw at 5 p.m. Mr
                        Delanoy, the director of the new training college, acted as referee. The
                        return match will probably be played next week on Shebin play ground, when
                        Mr. Keene, science teacher at Massi El Mashkoura secondary school, will
                        probably set as referee.</p>
                    <p>A remarkable incident occurred during the game. Two of the players became
                        locked and then began to pommel one another. Then the two sides joined in
                        the fray and next the spectators, who were very numerous rushed on to the
                        ground and great excitement ensued. Fortunatley order was restored by the
                        personal interposition of Mr. Hornblower, Inspector of the Ministry of the
                        Interior. </p>

                    <p>TELLS A PITIFUL TALE. </p>
                    <p>THE PANGS OF ACUTE INDIGESTION.</p>
                    <p>UNABLE TO TAKE TO AVOID PAIN.</p>
                    <p>PAINFULLY THIN AND WEAK.</p>
                    <p>LIKE A NEW WOMAN TO-DAY. </p>
                    <p>STRONG, GOOD APPETITE, CURED BY DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS.</p>
                    <p>"When my husband was ordered on foreign service six months ago," said Mr.
                        Wonde, he was terribly anxious about me, for my sufferings from
                        complications following acute chronic indigestion grew so intense that I
                        would have welcomed my death to release me from such torture."</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Emma Woods is the wife of a stoker in the Royal Navy, and lives at 48,
                        Cumberland-Street, Portsmouth. Happily, her recent letters to her husband,
                        still abroad, have relieved his anxiety, for she has written that Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People not only arrested further progress of
                        her obstinate disorder, but they so strengthened her digestive organs that
                        to-day she finds pleasure in life, with renewed motivity and freedom from
                        pain. "I took little notice at first," said Mrs. Woods, "of the fact that my
                        appetite had failed altogether, and it did not concern me at all if I went
                        for many hours without food.</p>
                    <p>"But this state was followed by dull, growing pains internally that would
                        arise soon after I took a meal, however light, and those would last for
                        hours. These pains became more acute and were accompanied by a distressing
                        feeling of fullness, as though my stomach was quite incapable of digesting
                        anything.</p>
                    <p>"Sharp cutting pains seizəd me from the chest and under the shoulder blades,
                        with sickly, fainting, feeling round my heart; it seemed a struggle for my
                        heart to beat at all when these fits attacked me.</p>
                    <p>"As food tortured me, I tried to live by taking less and less until it became
                        a matter of living on a mouthful or two. But my stomach was so weak that it
                        could not even retain such a light diet as milk puddings. The agonising
                        pains did not diminish. Now, I would be doubled up in torture; at times the
                        weight of my clothing was more than I could hear.</p>
                    <p>"Of course, doctors were consulted and did all they could for me, while I
                        took a quantity of medicine ; yet I continued to offer. As a result I became
                        partially thin and haggard, and so terribly weak that I tottered rather than
                        walked. One day I called on a friend who was quite upset about my
                        appearance, she earnestly advised me to begin a course of Dr. Williams' Pink
                        Pills, telling me she had taken them with splendid results. I decided to try
                        them, and thankful I am that I did so, for they made a new woman for me. The
                        first sign of improvement was the return of my appetite. I began to enjoy my
                        food. The pains following meals were less severe as I continued the pills,
                        until in time they disappeared entirely.</p>
                    <p>"After three boxes I could eat heartily without fear of suffering, but I kept
                        on with Dr. Williams' Pink Pills until I had taken eight boxes, when my
                        strength was restored, and my digestive organs invigorated and able to
                        derive nourishment from food.</p>
                    <p>"Today, I can eat anything without digestive trouble, feel strong and well,
                        and can get about as active as any woman. My husband is delighted with the
                        good reports I send him about my health."</p>

                    <head>Prospectus</head>
                    <p>THE COMPANY has been formed for the purposes stated in the Memorandum of
                        Association, and more particularly to establish a line of British
                        steamships, to supply the demand made by the impressive passenger traffic
                        for first class and rapid service between Europe and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The Plainfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Limited, of Glasgow, has
                        contracted with the Company for the construction of two turbina steamers of
                        about 18,000 tons gross register, the length of the vessels to be 550 feet
                        and breadth 60 feet. The steamers will each have five turbines, viz--three
                        turbines for going abroad and two for going astern. They will each have
                        three propellers and (according to specification) are to steam no less than
                        20 knots an hour, at which speed the passage between Marseilles and
                        Alexandria should be accomplished in 70 hours. Accommodation will be
                        provided for 500 first class and 280 second class passengers. . .</p>
                    <p>In preparing the specification for their steamers, the Directors have had in
                        view the recent great advance that has been made in the fitting of steamers
                        with the object of increasing the comfort of passengers. Beside state-room
                        accommodation of the most up to date character, a number of "cabinets de
                        laxe, each with private bathroom, etc, Adjoining will be provided, and in
                        addition to the usual public room there will be on the upper deck a
                        restaurant (having separate kitchens and service) in which meals will be
                        served a la carte.</p>
                    <p>In view of the ports, Marseilles and Alexandria, at which the steamers will
                        call, special attention has been paid to ventilation ; this will be affected
                        by the thermotank system by which the air in every part of the ships will be
                        changed six times an hour. </p>
                    <p>Other features will be children's saloon and a passenger lift communicating
                        with the various passenger decks.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that the Company's steamers will reproduce all the most
                        striking features </p>
                    <p>of the newest Atlantic liners and as regards comfort and speed, will surpass
                        anything hitherto attempted by any lines running between Europe and
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's Report of the 8th March, 1906, contains the following reference
                        with regard to the passenger traffic with Europe:</p>
                    <p>"I have allowed in my recent Annual Reports to the enormous insurance which
                        have taken place during the last few years in the passenger traffic between
                        Egypt and Europe. In 1902, 60,000, and in 1903, 74,000 passengers
                        disembarked at Port Said and Alexandria. In 1904 the total number was
                        90,400. In 1905 it rose to 99,992. These figures are exclusive of troops,
                        but include all classes of passengers." </p>
                    <p>The Directors believe that the special facilities which the Company's service
                        will provide will appeal to the largely increasing travelling public and
                        will also prove highly remunerative.</p>
                    <p>The contract price for the above-mentioned steamers is £6 6,000 payable in
                        the oral method by installments, whereof £406,000 is payable during
                        construction, leaving $400,000 payable on delivery of the steamers or at the
                        option of the Company by instalments extending over two years.</p>
                    <p>The Directors will in any event go to allotment, having regard to the fact
                        that the following. ing persons have applied for 40,000 ordinary and 40,000
