                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <head>THE "EGYPTIAN STANDARD."</head>
                    <p>We were recently compelled to express our opinions re the accusations made by
                        "Al Lowa" and its European editions with some vigour, We were not surprised
                        when a few days later a notice large type appropriately labelled
                        "Falsehood," and appearing in the "Egyptian Standard," accused the "Egyptian
                        Gazette" of wilful misstatements, and declared that Mustaplia Pasha's organs
                        had merely reproduced a communication from the Omdeh of Warrak and had in no
                        way accused M. Grandmoulin of wilful murder. Sunday's "Egyptian Standard"
                        contains an article from Mustapha Pasha Kamel, who asseverates that he and
                        his journals have never made any such statement and challenges the Press--or
                        rather that section of the Press which has refused to accept the "ipse
                        dixit" of our new prophet as being final in all matters to prove its
                        assertion. We are ready, nay more, we are delighted, to take up the gauntlet
                        which the Pasha has thrown down. In the "Egyptian Standard" of March 12 an
                        article, entitled "A Victim of Pigeon Shooting," was published by our
                        contemporary. It contained the account of the accident as given by the Omdeh
                        of Warrak and concluded with the remark that the French Consulate must make
                        a thorough | and impartial enquiry "so that people may understand that
                        Egyptians cannot be hunted as I game with impunity." On the following day an
                        article appeared on the third page of the "Egyptian Standard." It contained
                        no mention of the Omdeh of Warrak. After remarking that the affair had cause
                        a painful sensation the writer of this article remarked that "we" looked at
                        the whole incident from an "impartial point of view," but that the fact was
                        that M. Grandmoulin had shot a child either voluntarily or involuntarily.
                        After this excursion into the realms of the obvious and certain "remarks
                        anent the question of trespass, the article closes with two questions, which
                        we I give as they appear in our lurid contemporary "We wish......to ask the
                        following pertinent questions."</p>
                    <p>"1) What right had M Grandmoulin to shoot on land not his property?</p>
                    <p>"2) How is it possible that M. Grandmoulin still keeps his Government employ
                        accused and guilty as he is of assassination?"</p>
                    <p>We therefore reply to Mustapha Pasha Kamel that in accusing us of wilful
                        falsehood and in declaring that no accusation has been made against M.
                        Grandmoulin in his organs, he is not speaking the truth or anything near the
                        truth. His statements are as false as they are malicious, and when we think
                        that their author is regarded as a leader by certain Nationalists, we are
                        tempted to remark with the Anglo-French diplomatists in "The Modern
                        Traveller :"</p>
                    <p>"If such a man as that," said they,</p>
                    <p>"Is leader, they may go their way."</p>
                    <p>There is one alternative explanation which we offer in the hope that Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel's reputation for integrity may thereby be rescued (at the cost
                        of his reputation for possessing any write whatever). It is this - that
                        neither Mustapha Pasha nor his gladiators know enough English to be aware
                        that the word "assassination" is not used of accidental homicide, and that
                        they are sufficiently unintelligent not to see that the effect of their
                        phrases concerning impartiality is spoiled by the use of a term employed in
                        the description of wilful murder. In this case we should recommend our
                        critic to take a course of elementary lessons in English and the rules of
                        logic. But if, as we fear, our first hypothesis —that a deliberate falsehood
                        has appeared in the "Egyptian Standard"--be correct, we can only inform the
                        Nationalist leader that we have answered his challenge and that we throw
                        back in his teeth his accusation of lying.</p>

                        Lady Cromer, Mr. Mansfield de C.Findlay, C.M.G, the Minister of Public
                        Works, Sir Wm. Garstin, and nearly all the officials of the - Ministry,
                        several of the Advisers and heads of departments of the other Ministries,
                        and Dm:ny of the personal friends of the late Mr. Verschevyle.</p>
                    <p>We need not say that the Irrigation Department has suffered a great loss by
                        Mr Verschuyle's death. It is generally felt that a man of his wide technical
                        knowledge and high administrative capacities cannot very easily be replaced.
                        His relations with his juniors, both European and Egyptian, were always
                        excellent, for he possessed ready sympathy and tact, and was always anxious
                        to do everything in his power to aid young officials who gave proof of
                        character and intelligence.</p>

                    <head>SUCCESSFUL BAZAAR.</head>
                    <p>The Bazaar at the Continental Hotel on Saturday in aid of the funds for
                        "L'Amie de la Jeune Fille," resulted in the taking of some 3,000 francs, no
                        small sum when one realizes how very few weeks the scheme has been in
                        working. Mme Villfurth has been the chief instrument in the shaping of the
                        scheme, sand to her energies, much of the success of the bazaar is due. Many
                        thanks, too, are due to those who so generously gave such substantial
                        donations and gifts to the undertaking, and especially to G. Nungovich Bey
                        and to Mr. Braun, of the Continental Hotel, who kindly placed the big
                        drawing-room at the disposition of the committee and supplied the excellent
                        buffet.</p>
                    <p>Lady Cromer arrived early in the afternoon to open the bazaar, Mme Viuforth's
                        little daughter presenting her with a bouquet at the door, and she made
                        several purchases from the various stalls. There was a very fair attendance
                        later on, and people spent freely in the cause. Many and varied were the
                        things on sale, some of the lingerie being exceptionally good, and the
                        stalls devoted to toys and dolls were in great request. A brisk business was
                        done at the flower stall, the energetic lady in possession netting in some
                        cases 10s and 15s. for-a tiny buttonhole.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that the proceeds of the bazaar in addition to the funds already
                        collected will prove sufficient to establish the Cairo branch of this
                        society on a firm basis ; and that those who are already interested in the
                        soleme may have the satisfaction of seeing it develop into a real help and
                        boon to the friendless girls and women in Cairo.</p>

                    <head type="sub">A NEW STEAMSHIP LINE.</head>
                    <p>Egypt has hitherto been without direct and regular communication by sea with
                        Cyrenaica, and we are glad to hear that the enterprise of the
                        Florio-Rubattino Company will soon remedy this want. The steamers of the new
                        line, which the Italian Navigation Company will shortly start, will call at
                        Syracuse, Malta, Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, Dermah, Alexandria; Canea, and
                        on the return voyage will proceed to Dermah, Benghazi, Tripoli, Malta,
                        Syracuse, and other Sicilian porta.</p>
                    <p>There will be four or five steamers on the new line, of about 8,000 tons
                        each, and the departures will take place every fortnight. The company has
                        come to an agreement with the Italian Government on the arrangement for this
                        new service. There will be a regular mail service between the ports of call.
                        - It is expected that a large amount of cattle and cereals will by this
                        means find their way froni Cyrenaica to Alexandria. There will also be a
                        considerable pilgrim traffic during the pilgrimage season.</p>
                    <p>The formal approbation of the Italian Parliament to the scheme will be given
                        in all probability in May or June, and the regular sailings will begin
                        immediately afterwards.</p>
                    <p>Cyrenaica used to be one of the most flourishing Greek colonies on the South
                        Coast of the Mediterranean, and even under the blighting influence of
                        centuries of Turkish misrule it is still a beautiful country and full of
                        interesting remains of its former prosperity. Barley, dates, olives,
                        oranges, lemons and vegetables reproduced, and the principal imports are
                        metals, British and or her European manufactures, tea, beads, wine and
                        spirits, besides a number of articles for barter in Wadai, Bornu, and the
                        Western Sidan, whither caravans proceed from Tripoli ; but the caravan
                        trade, onde the mainstay of the country, has seriously diminished of late
                        years The principal articles of exporting are ostrich feathers, ivory,
                        skins, sponges, hides, esparto grass, cattle, and horses. The ancient ruins
                        in Cyrenaica, i.e., at Cyrene Ptolemais, and Apollonia, are interesting to
                        explorers, as well as those at Leptis Magna, which is close to Khoms, or 70
                        miles from the city of Tripoli ; agricultural colonies of Cretan Moslem
                        refugees are being formed in the neighbourhood. The town of Benghazi has a
                        population of about 15,000, consisting of Arabs, Greeks, Maltese, and a few
                        Levantines. The commerce in cereals, wool, cattle for Malta, and other
                        agricultural produce, is considerable, when a sufficient rainfall causes
                        good harvests.</p>

                        prospérité, et l'avenir de l'Egypte exigent impérieusement la bonne exigent
                        et l'accord parfait entre les musulmans et les coptes. Cette gravité n'a
                        échappé à personne ; aussi la requête en question fait-elle actuellement les
                        frais de toutes les conversations et se trouve-t-elle vivement commentée par
                        une partie de la presse indigène et critiguide de façon acerbe par certains
                        coptes.</p>
                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard" is incensed because our Greek contemporary, the
                        "Phare d'Alexandrie," refuses to concur with the "General Assembly's"
                        extravagances and remarks.</p>
                    <p>It says: "Le Phare d'Alexandrie" adds its voice to the clamour raised against
                        the Egyptian people. It is strange that a Greek such as M. John Haicalis can
                        so despise Egyptian patriotism when he must be aware of the great influence
                        played by the patriotic idea in the fortunes of his own country. We, ask him
                        the pertinent question why it was that the late Haicalis Pasha was of,
                        opinion, many years ago, that Egypt was ripe for independence. What has
                        occurred to render the country less unfit for this measure?</p>

                    <p>On Saturday last the members of the British Club and their lady friends were
                        again invited to a concert (this being the third which has been given this
                        year) and a very pleasant evening was spent. Mr. E. B. Gould, I.S.O., II. BM
                        Consul-General, and vice-president of the club, was present with Mrs. Gould
                        Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, the other vice-president, was unable to
                        attend, but Lady Hlomfield was present. The concert-room was, it possible,
                        more crowded than on the last occasion.</p>
                    <p>The opening item on the programme was a quartette given by the "Osiris Glee
                        Party" and entitled "Oh! who will o'er the downs 80 free " This was followed
                        by "Love, could I only tell thee," sung by Mr. Harald Sheldrick, and
                        accompanied by Mrs. Sheldrick'; he was in good voice and afforded general
                        pleasure Mrs Fdward Mogs came next and she captivated the audience with her
                        songs, "My Treasure" and "Philosophy," her voice being remarkable for its
                        sweetness and expression. An encore E veg insisted upon and for this she
                        sang "Annie Jaurie"; her accompaniments were played by Mrs A R. Brown The
                        next item was given by - an old favourite, Mr F M, Dodwell, who rendered
                        "The Chancellor's Dream" from "Iolanthe," in his well-known style. For an
                        encore he recited "Something Original," which was very laughable After this
                        we were favoured with a pianoforte solo by Miss B Cohu, entitled "Le Jet
                        d'eau." Miss Cohu has a capable command over the keyboard and at once
                        secured the goodwill of her listeners by her delicate and refined playing.
                        This was followed by a comic song called "Queer Questions," sung by Mr. Q.H
                        Nicholls, which proved to be very funny indeed and gave those present plenty
                        of cause for a good laugh Mr and Mrs. W.F. Sarjeant were both down on the
                        programme to sing, but Mrs. Sarjeant being unwell we were unfortunately
                        deprived of the pleasure of hearing them. Mr J. B. Clarke, kindly consented
                        to sing in the place of Mrs. Sarjeant, and soon sang himself into the graces
                        of his audience by his rendering of "The Song of the Bow," which concluded
                        the first part of the programme.</p>
                    <p>The second half comprised the following: Quartette, "On the Banks of Allan
                        Water," Osiris Glee Party ; encore, "Sweet and Low"; song, "Oh Memory," Mr.
                        F. M. Dodwell ; encores, recitations entitled "The Irish Fire Brigade" and
                        "The Pluckiest Deed I ever Did; song, "When dull care," Mr. J. B Clarke:
                        encore, "The Jolly Sailor"; song, "Sunbeam," Mrs. Edward Moss ; encore,
                        "Obstination"; comic song, "Adverts," Mr. O H Nicholls ; Fencore, "My
                        Inquisitive. Kiddie"; the final item being a domestic sketch entitled "Lord
                        and Lady Purplesang," given by Mr. and Mrs Goodrick, which was very
                        amusing.</p>
                    <p>A word of praise is due to the members of the Entertainment Committee of the
                        club for their enterprise in getting up these high-class entertainments,
                        especially as a lot of the talent secured is quite new to Alexandria. Such
                        success has attended their efforts that the concerts will now be a regular
                        feature throughout the winter season, and we understand that a series of
                        amateur theatrical entertainments will probably be arranged on a small
                        scale, provided sufficient members and their lady friends are found willing
                        to take part in them.</p>

                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE" </p>
                        <p>Sir, — Amongst the events in yesterday's races at Helouan was a two-mile
                            camel race After the first mile, and when opposite the grand-gʻand, one
                            camel, being completely exhausted, lay down. The rider, helped by the
                            native mob, including two policemen, by dint of flogging, made it rise.
                            This happened three times, the poor animal, each time it rose,
                            struggling a few paces forward and lying down until forced to rise by
                            dint of flogging with sticks and kourbashes It was uttering piteous
                            groans, foaming at the month, bleeding from a cut on each flank, besides
                            displaying other symptoms (which I need not mention) of nervous and
                            physical exhaustion After the animal lay down the third time, the rider
                            was forced to dismount and the camel was brought into the paddock. Such
                            a disgraceful exhibition of wilful cruelty to a dumb animal I have not
                            seen before in any part of the world. It seems to me that such
                            exhibitions do not raise the standard of sport. I therefore venture to
                            appeal to you, in the interests of dumb animals, for your support to
                            prevent a repetition of such inhuman scenes, at least before a European
                            crowd composed largely of Britishers. This unfortunate camel being about
                            400 yards behind the other competitors had no chance of winning the
                            race. Flogging it was consequently quite useless. - I am, ete, </p>

                            vous serais bien obligé si vous vouliez bien insérer dans votre journal
                            les quelques lignes qui suivent auxquelles votre impartialité ne
                            refugera certainewent pas la place. 1. J'ai lu dans les colonnes de
                            "l'Egyptian Gizette," que quelques personnes qui se disent Coptes ont
                            présenté à l'Agence Britannique une pétition pour exprimer leurs regrets
                            à l'endroit des décisions prises a mois de Février pas é par l'assemblée
                            Générale. T Or l'Assemblée Gén- rale représente toute la nation
                            Egyptienne. Elle a par conséquent nécessairement exprimé les vœux de
                            tous les Egyptiens, les Coptes aussi bien que les autres. Les pers:nnes
                            qui osent désavouer l'œuvre | mjestueuse accomplie parl s députations
                            égyp tienner ne peuvent donc avoir aucune qualité | pour représenter .
                            tout ou partie de la Nation. En Egypte, comme partout ailleur, les
                            éléments de la Nation forment uue seule et même unite indivisible dont
                            le sort a toujours été et doit toujours être le même. Tous les efforts
                            coupables prodigués pour créer la scission au sein de la pauvre Egypte
                            resteront dono toujours, espérons-le, inutiles et infruc tueux. | C'est,
                            en effet, grâce à des démarches ina vouées que les signataires de la p
                            tition ont consenti à apposer lenrs signatures. 1. Ils ont tous
                            certainement été attirés par des proniesses flatteuses ou obligés de
                            signer par complaisance Le fait même dénote d'aille rs qu'ils n'ont
                            aucune connaissance des institutions sociales modernes. Le moindre
                            notion de ces institutions indique que l'Assemblée Générale, dans ses
                            délibérations et décisions, les a représentés, comme elle a représenté
                            tout le monde égyption ; qu'il ne s'agit point en la matière de coptes
                            ou mahometang, mais d'Egypte et d'Egyptiens ; que ce sont les
                            pétitionnaires eux-mêmes qui, par le rs agissements suscitent, au sein
                            de la nation, la division qu'ils ont toujours vouln éviter. Les
                            signatuires les plus en vue sont d'ailleurs des protégés des autres
                            nations qui ne sont nullement intéressés directement au sort de
                            l'administration et de la Justice locales. En tous cas, la fleur de la
                            communauté copte et la jeunesse instruite se révoltent contre cet acte
                            incorreot et déloyal. Nous en sommes tous vivement indignés. Nous
                            protestons énergiquement contre cette représentation forcée et indigne
                            de nous. Quelques signat ires ramassés dans la rue ou autrement par des
                            promoteurs intéressés ne peuvent en "aucune façon former une
                            représentation copte Je ne vois d'ailleurs pas en quel honneur ou pour
                            quel motif ces messieurs s'intitulent coptea. Nous déanvouons
                            complètement, et la quallté de ces personnes, et leurs meuées. Nous

                                continues. There are 160 children on board, and the crew are
                                bringing them ashore in their arms. A high wind has cleared away the
                                fog. Three compartments of the vessel are flooded. The salvage

                                at £200,000. </p>

                    <p>Mr A. F. Bory, a Swiss gentleman, has arrived in Cairo from the Cape, having
                        travelled overland. </p>
                    <p>The interest of this journey of eight months through the very heart of Africa
                        lies in its uneventful character, which testifies to the extraordinary
                        advance of civilization and the facilities of travel in the remote regions
                        traversed.</p>
                    <p>At Karonga, on Lake Nyassa, began really the first part of the journey away
                        from civilization. The Stevenson road is about 220 miles in length, and runs
                        across the Tanganyika Plateau from the north of Lake Nyassa to the south of
                        Lake Tanganyika, and it takes about a fortnight to traverse. Mr. Bory
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Thanks to the courtesy of the German officials, I was allowed to cross the
                        territory from Usambara to Bukoba, a route which is -really closed to
                        caravans. This part of the journey was the most interesting of the whole
                        trip, as the country is still perfectly new. It took me 26 days along native
                        tracks to reach Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza, the distance being about 328
                        miles, and during this time I only saw white people three times for the
                        first ten days I did not see any natives, as they used to run away on the
                        approach of the caravan, taking with them everything they. possessed. I then
                        entered the Urundi country, which offers beautiful scenery. The Burundi are
                        very tall and slim, and have perfect features-good nose and lips – a great
                        contrast with the usual negro type. They are, however, of a very dark
                        complexion They wear gweeping garments of bark cloth and necklaces of beads
                        and carved amulets, and generally a very heavy wooden or ivory bracelet on
                        their left. Forearm. </p>
                    <p>"I stopped for a day at Kanazi, a very pretty place overlooking the Victoria
                        Nyanza and several islands The Sultan of Kanazi is a very important man in
                        the country Five years ago he was dressed in skins and lived in a very rough
                        hus. Now he has a substantial European house and is dressed in a kind of
                        uniform. He received me in this house and offered me some whisky and soda.
                        The Germany told me this change was due to the Uganda railway, which has
                        brought civilization so near. Next day I reached Bukoba, the German military
                        station on the Victoria Nyanza. Having obtained four of the Sultan's canoes
                        I left for Entebbe in Uganda, and those days spent on the lake in native
                        canoes made of planks sewn together with reeds and grass were a very curious
                        experience. The natives usually sing whilst paddling the boat, and some of
                        their songs are not without charm, though they always have a mournful
                        strain. </p>
                    <p>"From Entebbe to Gondokoro I was again on a trade route, I avoided the Nile
                        on account of the many mosquitoes, and kept to the old inland road Game was
                        very plentiful and antelopes seemed to be quite fearless of the caravan. </p>
                    <p>"Thus.I concluded my trip from South Africa to Egypt, which lasted eight
                        months from the time I landed at Dürban to my arrival in Cairo. The actual
                        journey across Central Africa from Chinde, at the mouth of the Zambesi, to
                        Gondokoro on the Nile occupied six months, three of which I spent in tents,
                        having covered 1,000 miles on foot. The trip did not entail any serious
                        hardship or danger, my worst enemies being occasional bad water mosquitoes,
                        and fever. I did not come across any wild beasts, although I heard the
                        roaring of lions several times." </p>

                    <p>The expenditure during the past twelve months in connection with the
                        properties in Egypt and the Sudan was £9,839. At Sept. 30, 1905, the profit

                    <head>EGYPT'S EXPORTS.</head>
                    <head>GUM ARABIC.</head>
                    <p>In view of the fact that gum arabic forms one of the more important of the
                        minor exports from Egypt, we think a few remarks on the trade itself, and
                        the methods of handling the raw products, may possibly be of some interest." </p>
                    <p>The gum arabic exports for the last six years show the fall in the selling
                        price during the period in question. In 1901 the average price per kilo was
                        nearly 38 milliemes. (8 d), whilst 1 st year this figure dropped to 20
                        milliemes (5d). The yield, too, in 1906 wes the lowest since 1901. </p>
                    <p>It is perhaps unnecessary to state that the gum is really the sap from a
                        special kind of tree, which grows from 3 to 5 yards in height, whole forests
                        of which are found in the Kordofan Province and also near Gedid in the White
                        Nile Province The natives are free to collect the gum, the only tax being a
                        royalty levied at Omdurman. This royalty, which last year was about PT. 12 2
                        6 a cantar (991bs.), varice according to the market price of the gum, and is
                        fixed annually by the Sudan Government. </p>
                    <p>The seasons during which the trees yield their sap runs from December to May
                        Prior to gathering the " crop," the natives prepare the trees by slightly
                        cutting the bark in numerous places. The gap then exudes, solidifies in the
                        shape of large and small lumps, and is afterwards gathered by hand, such
                        gathering being done before the rainy season commences. </p>
                    <p>There are two main classes of gum, viz., Ambery and Bleached. In the latter
                        case, the gum is merely exposed to the strong action of the sun generally in
                        Omdurman -- whilst in the former instance it is allowed to retain its
                        natural amber colour.. </p>
                    <p>The best gum, and the largest crop, comes from Kordofan, an inferior quality
                        being found in the Ghezireh Province. Very little of the latter, however, is
                        handled by the European merchants, as there is practically no market for it,
                        abroad. The bulk of the Kordofan ambery gum is sold abroad in tgurts," which
                        is the technical name for the raw product as delivered from the forests by
                        the natives The amount of grading done in Egypt and the Sudan is gradually
                        becoming less and less, as the foreign buyer prefers to do this work
                        himself. If done on this side, the sorting is usually done by native girls
                        at either Omdurman, Cairo, or Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>After being collected, the gum is taken to the villages - principally Dueim
                        and there sold by the native to the Sudanese brokers for cash. The goods are
                        then forwarded by boat to Omdurman-which is the principal gum market in the
                        Sudan-where they are repacked for markets in strong double sacks holding
                        about 300 lbs. Instead of calculating the usual 100 rotolis (99 lbs) to the
                        cantar, the merchants at Omdurman receive 110 rotolis, the extra ten
                        covering any loss on transit and all other waste. </p>
                    <p>The next stage on the journey to Europe is from Omdurman to Khartoum North by
                        boat, the cost of transit, including all other charges, varying from P.T. 1
                        to P.T. 2 (2 d to 6d) the cantar (99 lbs). </p>
                    <p>Prior to the opening of the railway between Khartoum and Port-Sudan, ile gum
                        was carried either down the Nile by boat to Cairo, or by camels across the
                        desert to Suakin, the time, taken in the latter case being 20 day, and the
                        cost about PT 30 (6/1) the eantar but varying according to the supply of
                        cainels. Now, however, the journey to Port-Sudan is done in about two days,
                        the freight being P.T. 320 £3:5:8 the ton of 1000 kilograms. This figure is
                        reduced by 10 % for consignments of ten tons. </p>
                    <p>From Port-Sudan the gum goes by steamer to Suez, where it is sometimes
                        graded, and then either transhipped for Europe, America, or Australia as the
                        case may be, or else sent on to Cairo or Alexandria by rail. </p>
                    <p>The principal markets for gum arabic are Marseilles, Havre, Hamburg,
                        New-York, London, Liverpool, Antwerp, Barcelona, Melbourne, and Trieste. </p>
                    <p>The whole of the export trade is practically in the hands of Europeans, the
                        shipping terms of payment being cash against documents, or from one to three
                        months credit. In the case of a market like Melbourne, the buyer usually has
                        a bank credit in London, upon which the seller is at liberty to draw. </p>
                    <p>The confectionery trade is perhaps the principal purchaser of gum arabic,
                        though a very large number of other industries, e.g., chemical works,
                        printing and dyeing mills, letter-press printers, and so on, are interested
                        in this product of the Sudan. </p>
                    <p>At the present moment, the Sudan article experiences great competition from
                        the Senegal gum, whilst in certain trades we understand that dextrine--a
                        substance manufactured from the starch. extracted from the potato--replaces
                        gum when the price of the latter is too high. (Journal of the British
                        Chamber of Commerce.) </p>

                    <p>On Thursday evening last an important session of the International Order of
                        Good Templars was held at Kassasine, or as we may more historically term it,
                        the great battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir. </p>
                    <p>At this spot, where our brave dead comrades sleep, the first G. sod Templary,
                        meeting was held, a fitting commemoration to their dead comrades' glorious
                        achievement in the suppression of the notorious rebel Osmap Digna. Here,
                        too, on the morning in question, we fought a hard battle after a prolonged
                        night march, and suppressed the enemy. </p>

                        transaction of routine business the meeting proceeded, on "Good of Order."
                        It was suggested, supported, and carried unanimously that we hold an
                        amalgamated session at Cairo at an early date-date of meeting to be
                        published in "Egyptian Gazette." The next item was a suggestion restricting

                        remain on probation for a period not exceeding 6 months. The views of the
                        members may be summarized as follows: </p>
                    <p>The Order, through a violations and readmission, shall becqına as it were a
                        laughing stock, and staunch members had, become 80 disgusted, that means
                        must be resorted to in order to prevent the annihilation of the Order. These
                        unprincipled men, backed by men who abhor the principles enunciated by Good
                        Templars, are trying to ruin the cause, which means the resuscitation of the
                        English race from degeneracy and ruin. " As representing Good Templary in
                        Egypt it was resolved to forward a motion to Grand Lodge on the matter. The
                        session was only closed at 9.20 p.m. </p>

                    <p>The last papers from Rome. bring us the news of the death from influenza of
                        Sir Thos Hanbury, KC.V.O., 80 well known as the creator and proprietor of
                        the famous garden near the village of La Mortola, a mile or so from
                        Ventimiglia, on the Western Riviera. He was born in 1832, and was brother of
                        the distinguished pharmacologist, the late Daniel Bell Hanbury of Clapham,
                        born in 1825, who joined at an early age the well known firm of
                        pharmaceutical chemists, Allen, Barry and Co., who had succeeded Messrs.
                        Bevanat Ploughcourt, Lombard-street, City. William Allen, F.R.S., F.L.S.,
                        the senior partner, was president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great
                        Britain, which he had been mainly instrumental in founding, and a great
                        philanthropist as well as scientist. He died in 1843 at Lindfield, in
                        Sussex, where he had established schools, workshops, and playgrounds for
                        both sexes. Daniel Hanbury took a great interest in the botanical
                        determination of the sources of obscure vegetable drugs, and, since 1850,
                        published numerous papers on the subject. In 1855 he was elected F.L.S.; in
                        1857 be became treasurer of the Linnean Society; and, in 1861, F.R.S. He
                        died in 1876 at his residence at Clapham, after greatly contributing to our
                        knowledge of Chinese medicinal and economic plants by examining and
                        describing the vegetable products, transmitted to bim by his brother Thomas,
                        now just deceased. The latter was a merchant at Shanghai from 1853 to 1871,
                        and purchased the estate of the Orengo family of Ventimiglia, then an olive
                        grove, with the "Palazzo" of that name as a residence, in 1866. He created
                        the celebrated garden, now existing, assisted by his brother Daniel. A year
                        before his death the latter had published, in 1874, in conjunction with
                        Professor F. A. Flückiger of Strassburg University, a learned and valuable
                        work called "Pharmacographia, or a History of the Principal Drugs of
                        Vegetable Origin in Great Britain and British India," the historical
                        information in which is due to Hanbury. A gevond edition was published in
                        1879, and a French one in 1878, with notes by Dr. J. L. de Lanessan of
                        Paris. A year after his Heath Daniel Hanbury's scientific papers were
                        collected and published by Mr Joseph Ince, in 1879, and a French one in
                        1878, with notes by Dr. J. L. de Lanessan of Paris. A year after his death
                        Daniel Hanbury's scientific papers were collected and published by Mr Joseph
                        Ince, in 1876, and his fine herbariun of 610 species of plants is now in
                        possession of the Pharmaceutical Society, which published a catalogue of
                        them in 1892 His name was immortalised in that of a new genus of Mexican C
                        curbitaceae (Hanburia) in 1858, and a selection of sixty of the most
                        important volume of his botanical library was presented to Kew by his
                        brother, the late Sir Thom-18, in 1893. The latter was a great benefactor to
                        the neighbourhood of Ventimiglia, to which he had presented a library and
                        museum, and, quite recently, gave £2,000 towards the creation of a public
                        garden there. He, also, presented the University of Genoa with a Botanical
                        Institute inaugurated at the International Botanical Congress of 1892. His
                        garden at La Mortola, covering nearly 100 acres, has long been celebrated as
                        having the finest collection of soclinatized plants from all quarters of the
                        globe in existence, in spite of the great dryness of the climate, there
                        being only about forty rainy days in winter and two hundred cloudless ones
                        in the year. The catalogue of 1889 gives the number of plants in the garden
                        as 3,600, but many additions have since been made, and the possibilities of
                        acclimatization are marvellously exemplified, The pretty rose-coloured
                        acacia (albizzia julibrissin), so familiar on the shores of the Adriatic in
                        July, flourishes here to perfection, and it is surprising that this elegant
                        tree with fern-like foliage should still be absent from Alexandrian gardens.

                        <p>Inniskilling Dragoons I. (SCRATCH). Mr W. Holland 1 ,, Bowen II. Major
                            Paterson III. ,, Haig back) </p>
                        <p>K.O.S.B. A + 10 GOALS. Mr. Furber. Capt. Kennedy. Major Stevenson. Capt.
                            Stoney (back). </p>
                        <p>The Dragoons started 10 goals to the bad and made very little headway the
                            first chukker. The K.O.S B. team played a keen and combined game. It was
                            only just as the bell sounded that the Dragons scored their first goal.
                            In the 2nd chukker, the Dragoons came away and scored a goal in the
                            first minute. Then they spent four minutes hitting on both sides of the
                            goal posts, but always just failing to hit through. They eventually
                            succeeded and quickly followed this up with another, the score at
                            half-time being : Dragoons, 4 goals ; K.O.S.B., 10 goals. Left with 16
                            minutes play to make 6 goals the Dragoons pressed hard, but their same
                            bad luck attended them, their shots at goal being singularly
                            unfortunate, and at the call of time they were still 8 goals to the bad.
                            - To start 10 goals behind is a big undertaking, but with any luck the
                            Dragoons would have won. At the same time the K.O.S.B. team played very
                            well and pluckily, and they are to be congratulated on their win Score :
                            Dragoons, 7 goals ; K.O.S.B., 10 goals.</p>
                        <p>2ND MATCH.</p>
                        <p>Egyptian Army. + 3 GOALS. Capt Gordon II. Capt. Amery I. Major Gillson
                            III. Capt. Rome, (back).</p>
                        <p>Inniskilling Dragoons II. + 7 GOALS. Mr. Eleury Tealon. Mr. Merriman. Mr.
                            Mixon. Capt. Holland. </p>
                        <p>The Dragoons' second team played an unexpectedly sound game. The E. A.
                            team failed to find a proper combination. The match was a level one,
                            only one goal being the difference at the call of time. The Dragoons'
                            2nd team started 4 goals up, this being the difference between the
                            handicap. - At the call of time the scores were : E. A., 4 goals ;
                            Dragoons 2nd team, 5 goals. </p>
                        <p>3RD MATCH. Tourists. (+ 5 GOALS) Mr. Vandeleur I. Mr. Ogilby II. Mr. de
                            Preville III. Mr. Marsham, back</p>
                        <p>Staff and Departmental. (SCRATCH) Capt Hadow I. Capt. Dunbar II. Capt.
                            Bartlett III. Mr. Jenkinson (back).</p>
                        <p>Major Pirie was away, so Mr. Marsham took his place. The Tourists started
                            5 goals up, and very soon added another goal to their score. The Staff,
                            however, soon got together and some brilliant shots by Captains Dunbar
                            and Bartlett resulted in several goals. At the beginning of the last
                            chukker the game was 6 all. One more was soon added by the Staff, thug
                            winning by one goal. </p>
                        <p>Three matches will be played on Wednesday.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        Bre fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. </p>

                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, aid possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than any other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to On leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some
                            will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                            sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each
                            of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe. </p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co's steamers,
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            m chto interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic renmates that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in BC 212, when Archimedes was slain--his tomb is to be seen.
                            The cathedral was once an ancient pas au temple. PALERMO, with about
                            300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city he
                            Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                            Giovannia degli Erimiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                            Museum Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                            visit. </p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria, every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days. </p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino
                            Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay-Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento (you can drive too] will take you on to Capri. </p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours All who can will
                            devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                            portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well
                            known to need comment here. </p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where all other week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excurssions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade. In Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallum brosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from. Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view </p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset. </p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO, One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>- The most I picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with the record

                            phenomenally equable temperature- warm in winter and deliciously cool
                            breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer. </p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes and paintings, are
                            a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in
                            Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble calumns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santa filled with its wonderful tombs. </p>

                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit. </p>

                            patronised by travellers to Egypt. As regards the train journeys from
                            Cairo the shortest is that to Alex: Indria, without change (3 hours).
                            That to Port Said can now be made without change in 4 ½ hours. The least
                            expensive way to England is hy the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
                            lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant liners
                            also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. </p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Vilan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass &amp; quiet stay. The total absence
                            of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart,
                            carriage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life
                            at. every turn. The approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that
                            of any other seaport. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite,
                            born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the
                            tops of Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole
                            glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon. Going
                            northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.
                            COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            olie-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza: Boats leave Como
                            frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and
                            the scenery on either side going up the lake is most enchanting
                            CERNOBBIO is a charming spot.; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and
                            Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio- opposite. The
                            walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most
