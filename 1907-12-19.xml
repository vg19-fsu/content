                    <head>Lord Kelvin's Death.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday telegrams announce the death of the greatest modern British man of
                        science, who was as supreme in his own line as was Pasteur in France and Von
                        Helmholtz in Germany. Lord Kelvin was born in Belfast in 1824, and came of
                        Scoto- Irish race of Ulster which has been so prolific in genius. His
                        father, Dr. James Thomson, professor of mathematics in the Royal Academical
                        Institute, Belfast, was in 1832 appointed to the chair of mathematics in his
                        alma mater, the old College of Glasgow which formerly stood on the west side
                        of the High Street. His son William, who was destined to play a heroic part
                        in the field of science, became a student of the college while a mere child
                        of eleven or twelve, and astonished the older scholars in his father's class
                        by his preternatural quickness in solving the problems. His talent for
                        mathematics was indubitable, and his father sent him to St. Peter's College,
                        Cambridge, where he graduated as Second Wrangler and first SMith's prizeman
                        in 1845. The senior Wrangler probably owed his triumph to ready writing, for
                        one of the examiners was heard to say that he was unworthy "to cut Thomson's
                        pencils for him," and he has sence been forgotten.</p>
                    <p>While at Cambridge Thomson began to publish papers on physical subjectsfor
                        example, heat and electricitybut he was active in various directions, and so
                        far from being the pale student, oversome with night work, he was given to
                        open air sports, gained the Silver Sculls, and rowed in the winning boat of
                        the Oxford and Cambridge race. Enrolled a Fellow of St. Peter's, he entered
                        the laboratory of the famous Regnault in Paris, and in 1846 was called to
                        the Chair of Natural Philosophy in his old college at Glasgow, a congenial
                        post, which, in spite of tempting offers, he never quitted. In 1852, he
                        espoused Miss Margaret, a daughter of Mr. Walter Crum, F. R. S., of Rouken
                        Castle, Thornliebank, the famous calico printer, who has distinguised for
                        his investigations on the nature of cotton fibre. </p>
                    <p>It is impossible to give any but the merest outlines of the inventions of
                        Lord Kelvin. He contributed more than any other man to the success of the
                        Atlantic cable by enunciating the law of retardation whereby engineers were
                        enabled to design a cable, which would give a satisfactory speed to the
                        messages. He invented the mirror instrument for receiving the messages to be
                        sent through the cable. He next produced the siphone recorder, which with
                        the mirror is now employed on most of the submarine cables throughout the
                        world. His most important aid to navigation was the adjustable compass which
                        bears his name. He did more any other electrician to introduce accurate
                        methods of measuring electricity. His machine for predicting the level of
                        the tides in any part of the world was his chief non-electrical invention.

                    <head>CAIRO OPERA SEASON. LA FAVORITA.</head>
                    <p>The chief incidents in "La Favorita" were the singing of M. Flachat and the
                        chorus. The chorus in the first and last acts, were as one full voice,
                        breaking or drifting into true and faultless barmony, not merely fulfilling
                        the | ; bald requirements of the score, but achieving its meaning and
                        enhancing its beauty. To me the final chorus of monke and nuns was one of
                        the moat delightful pieces of 'ensemble' singing I have ever heard in opera.
                        M. Flachat fulfilled all and more than [ had hoped for. His voice, always
                        true and full of meaning, took on every shade of colour and passion,
                        renunciation and despair. It is so seldom that the French tenor voice can
                        please without prejudice : it is apt to savour of throat, to be husky,
                        forced, noisy ; but M. Flachat was free from all this and yet bad the
                        characteristic warmth and suggestion of the best 'demi-caractére.' The
                        others dog well enough. M. Gorins (M. Valette" was inscribed for the part,
                        but a change was made) was consistent, but too vigorous : M. Coiglio was
                        certainly good, dignified and emphatic ; Mme. Broglia is ap- parently still
                        unwell, but she was quite ade- quate: her voice accentuates the extreme of
                        the French contralto, constrained, rather forced, apt to be profuse in
                        moments of passion, not always pleasing, but het technique and singing in
                        general seemed good. M.Delmas and Mile Gulberte were excellent in their
                        rather slight parts ; itis so important to fill the lesser parts well, an
                        opera con be so wholly marred by details. The one deadly drawback to the
                        opera was—to my mind—the ballet, not from any intrinsic fault of its own,
                        but because an opera like "La Favorita" is to my poor thinking hardly
                        suitable for such interludes, it needs all it can be given to carry it
                        through, and surely two long ballets are out of place, and should he
                        reserved for some performance when the music and singing is practically
                        non-existent as an interest. There was some such piece given last year in
                        conjunction with "La Fille du Régiment" and I would suggest that certain
                        nights be dedicated to that kind of production; ballet is popular with the
                        majority of the Khedivial audiebce, but surely the minority should not be
                        sacrificed on the altars of tights and twirls. Still, ballet or no ballet,
                        M. Flachat and the chorus would have been worth hearing on any stage, and
                        the highest possible praise is due to them.</p>

                    <p>We have received news from Bagdad that during the heavy rain of 1907 the
                        Euphrates burst its banks near Feluja, and flowed into the Tigris up and
                        downstream of Bagdad. Since then the Turkish authorities have been trying
                        hard to repaire the banks, but it seems likely that this coming flood, if a
                        heavy one, will see the Euphrates cut a new channel for itself straight into
                        the Tigris downstream of Bagdad. In this case the state of the land on the
                        Euphrates will be far more serions than it is to-day with the Euphrates
                        flowing down the Hindia Canal' and leaving the Babylon channel.</p>

                        Major General Bullock, who was regretably absent through the illness of Mrs.
                        Bullock.</p>
                    <p>These formalities being over, the real business of the afternoon began and in
                        a very short time the stalls were being shorn of their pretty wares. These
                        were of so varied and so moderate in price that the stall had but little
                        difficulty in disposing of their goods. In addition to the usual Stores of
                        children's garments, linen and woollen goods, cakes, sweets, Oriental and
                        Indian goods, there was a delightful selection of native pottery and English
                        china-ware, presided over by Mrs. Gunter, and Lady Rogers' beaotiful flower
                        stall was augmented by a second on which were piled fine specimens of fruit
                        and vegetables. The children were kept digging for surprises out of a
                        branpie, the cake and sweet stall was extensively patronized by both them
                        and their elders, and as the atter- noom wore on there was a general exodus
                        to the tea room, where the excellent orchestra of the"hotel was to be heard,
                        and urbane waiters were dispensing the much appreciated meal. Business was
                        carried on briskly till 6 o'clock when the afternoon's proceedings were
                        brought to a termination with a few well chosen words of thanks and sympathy
                        with the cause by the Rev. R. Somers, of the Scotch Chorch. Incidently we
                        may mention that this Cairo branch of the Y.W.C.A. has developed on lines
                        not always to be found in the branches at home. Connaught Honse bas grown
                        into what at home would be called a residential club for working women, and
                        as such it has become the very greatest boon to girls who are earning their
                        livelihood in the Cairo, and who are unable or disinclined to live in the
                        more expensive pensions and hotels. The present accomodation permits of some
                        18 beds, and durmg the winter these are almost always occupied, and the
                        enterprise becomes practi- cally self supporting. The restrictions are so
                        few, and the advantages of Connaught House so many, that it ranks among the
                        most usetol institutions in the country. Lady Cromer was a very great
                        sympathiser in the work so ably carried on by Mists Maclnnes and Miss
                        Margerison, and indeed she still continues her interest, as do all those whe
                        have ever appreciated thé high endeavours of the Cairo branch of the
                        Y.W.C.A.</p>

                    <p>Our Port Said correspondent writes under yesterday's date: "Contrary to the
                        rumour circulated here yesterday, the coal discharging and bunkering arabs
                        did not come out or strike this morning. Attempts were made last night to
                        prevent any workmen going to the harbour to work, but there were not serious
                        disturbances. From reports | gather that there isa small party who do not
                        favour another strike. Sbhonld these men hold out from the others when the
                        strike is opened some little distunbance may be expected in the Arab
                        quarter. It appears there was a little scuffle early this morning between
                        the two parties. The police were quickly on the spot and have arrested some
                        of the ring leaders but nothing happened of a sensational charaeter.</p>

                            for some time had the assistance of Mr. Carson of the same department.
                            They were much hampered in their operations, for at this season of the

                    <p>The Sudan railway authorities announce a considerable reduction of freight
                        charges on dhurra and other grains. According to the new tariff, freight
                        charge from Khartoum North to Port Sudan and Suakin, including charges for
                        loading and unloading, will not exceed 12 P.T. per ardeb. This reduction
                        will no doubt encourage the export of grain from the Sudan, and with this
                        encouragement given them, the Sudan grain merchents should be able to secure

                    <head>Echoes of the Boom. An Hotel Case.</head>
                    <p>The case of The Tewfik Palace Hotel, Pemberton v. Bentley came on for hearing
                        on Wednesday before the Mixed Tribunals at Cairo. This was an action brought
                        by Willough by Arthur Pemberton to enforce payment of a loan of $6,000
                        advanced by him to the defendant, Dr. Bentley, in the year 1901 to enable
                        the latter to complete the purchase of the Tewfik Palace, Helouan, from H.H.
                        The Khedivah Mother. Maitre Carton de Wiart, who appeared for the plaintiff,
                        explained the position in a brief and amusing speech. His client, Mr.
                        Pemberton, was introduced to the Defendant in 1901, while the former was on
                        a visit to his brother-in-law, the late Sir Elwin Palmer. Dr. Bentley had
                        entered into a contract to aquire the Twefik Palace with a view to
                        converting it into an Hotel and Sanatorium, to be used in conjunction with
                        his medical practice. Not having the necessary cash in hand, he was obliged
                        to borrow $6,000 to make up the amount asked. viz. $13,000, giving a
                        mortgage on the property to Mr. Pemberton. This mortgage has since become
                        due but remains unpaid. Recently Dr. Bentley, it appeared, had been
                        endeavouring to resell the hotel, and had, during the late "land boom",
                        entered into negotiations with various companies and individuals for this
                        purpose. Ultimately a firm of land agents in Cairo had agreed to give
                        $60,000 for the property subject to a valuation. This firm, in their turn,
                        arranged a resale through a financial group which included a gentleman
                        connected with the Egyptian Estates Limited, to the Helouan Development
                        Company, a condition being that the names of the parties interested should
                        be kept secret by Dr. Bentley, until the completion of the sale to the
                        company. </p>
                    <p>None of these contracts had in fact been carried out, owing to lack of funds,
                        and Mr. Pemberton has since endeavoured to induce Dr. Bentley to repay him,
                        but without success, the "crisis... from which", said Maitre. Carton, "we
                        are still suffering... having intervened." At this point the president
                        (Judge Tuck) adjourned the case.</p>
                    <p>The Defendant is represented by Maitre, Bouboulis instructed by Maitre.
                        Devonshire, and Maitre. Dumreicher is watching the case on behalf of other
                        interested parties. We understand that interesting developments are expected
                        in this action, which involves some well- known business men in Cairo.</p>

                        Hohono vitch, an ex-employé, for wrongful . dismissal without notice The
                        plaintiff, who entered the company's service in 1905, as buffet manager, at
                        a salary of L.B. 10 per month with com- mission amounting to P.T. 40 per
                        diem, was dismissed at the beginning of the present year in consequence of
                        complaints by customers of the service etc, having been previously asked to
                        leave There was no contract, it was contended on behalf of the com- pany,and
                        the defendants had acted gener- ously in allowing the plaintiff his salary
                        to the end of April, despite the trouble he had given them in refusing to
                        resign, which caused him to be forcibly expelled on January 28th. The
                        plaintiff, represented by Maitre Larmotte, contends that he has suffered
                        severely by dismissal, as he had a restaurant and "pensionuaires" besides
                        the cold |unch bar mentioned by the defence.</p>

                            enthusiastic about the voyage and comfort of the boat. Her arrival also

                        <p>Among the well known people expected at the Winter Palace Hotel for

                    <p>The tourist office of the Hamburg-American Line, who are the general
                        passenger Agents in Egypt for the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co, Ltd. have just
                        opened a new passenger office in St. Catherine square, Alexandria. The Agent

                    <p>Some Italian Republican and Socialist newspapers have stated that the visit
                        of the Duchess of Aosta to Egypt was due to political reasons, and is a
                        quasi-exile because the Princess attended the recent marriage at Wood Norton
                        of Don Carlos de BOurbon and Princess Louise of France. The sister of the
                        Duchess married the son of the Count of Casserta, who claims the throne of
                        Naples as brother of King Francesco 3. The Duchess is the wife of a Prince
                        of the House of Savoy, who resides in the Royal Palace at Naples and yet her
                        sister is the daughter in law of the claimant to the throne of Naples, who
                        as Count of Caserta occupied the place of honour at the wedding banquet. The
                        presence of the Duchess caused great offence in Rome and so the Duchess has
                        come for a prolonged stay in Egypt. These reports in the Italian press are
                        declared to be quite baseless, for the Duchess's visit to Egypt is solely
                        due to her ill-health.</p>
                    <p>The earl and contess Rothes have arrived at the Savoy Hotel. Their party
                        includes Lady Mildred Leslie, Mrs. Fellowes, Captain Devenish, Mr. H.

                        etant vendeur, il ne se traite evidemment que des affaires occasionnelles et
                        insignifiantes, et cela au prix d'une nouvelle reduction de la cote. La
                        plupart des titres les plus deprecies etant irrealisables, l'epargue qui a
                        un besoin immediat de numraire se rejette sur les titres d'un echange plus
                        facile, entre autres sur l'obligation credit foncier egyptien dont la
                        nouvelle est au pair a 250 tr. et l'ancienne a 279 fr. 50. Ceci demontre
                        qu'aux grands maux il faut les grands remedes. On a voulu temporiser dans
                        l'attente d'une reprise avec des situations equivoques qui de mandaient une
                        liquidating dans des conditions encore plus defavorables. Esperons que les
                        interesses comprendront enfin qu'il est inutile et meme dangereux de
                        remettre a plus tard une operation urgente, et un mot, qu'il vaut mieux
                        faire la part du feu que de tout perdre en cherchant a tout sauver.</p>
                    <p>Ce n'est d'alilleurs qu' a la suite de ces liquidations volontaires ou
                        forcees de la masse des engagements surchagers qu'on peut esperer un
                        relevement serieux et durable. </p>

                    <dateline>London, December 13.</dateline>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that Lombard Street must be prepared for
                        stiff discount rates for some weeks to come. In the first place, the task of
                        clearing up the wreckage in America isa slow process. Further failures have
                        taken place this week, and cash is re- turning only very slowly into
                        circulation. The preminom of gold still continues, and further shipments
                        from this side are expected. So far as can be gathered, the banks are still
                        retaining the paper currency, notwithstanding that the date fixed for the
                        renewal of cash payments passed some ten days ago.</p>
                    <p>South America is also likely to require a substantial quantity of gold in the
                        near future. The crops there are reported to be excellent, and will probably
                        be sold at high prices, so that London will have to fakea large share in
                        providing the'necessary funds. Another point to be reckoned with in
                        considering the future movements of discoont rates is the serious financial
                        position in Germany. As already reported in your columns, the Budget
                        recently large deficit, in spite of economy in the varions departments, and
                        - Government were compelled to a million of the Sinking Fund for Imperial
                        Debt in order to reduce the deficit. It is therefore probable that gold will
                        go to Berlin hefore the end of the year.</p>
                    <p>One bright feature in the outlook is the cessation of the demands for Egypt,
                        and it is hoped that the gold you have already obtained will be safficient
                        to finance the crop. Indeed we are-given to understand that we may anti-
                        cipate a return of the precious metal from Egypt in January, and that your
                        banks have several millions of gold in their coffers in Egypt ; this being
                        so, they should be more ready to make advances on Egyptian Stocks and Shares
                        in your markets, all of which should tend to improve the situation. The
                        position of the. Bank of England has undergone a substantial improvement
                        during the past week, the increase' in the re- serve amounting to
                        £1,767,823, bringing the total to £23,674,013, which compares with
                        £22.748,055 in the corresponding week of 1906. The proportion to liabilities
                        is up 2.93 on the week, being now 46.95, againét 47.02 last year. The
                        increase in coin and bullion is £1,400,000, and the note circulation has
                        con- tracted to the extent of nearly £360,000. Other Securities have been
                        reduced by 1} millions, as the result of the maturing of bills at the Bank,
                        but Public Deposits have declined £200,000. Other Securities are up
                        £727,376.</p>
                    <p>The money market has continned easy throughout the week, and overnight
                        accomoda- tion realises only 4 to 44 per cent. Discount rates are very firm,
                        the rate for three months' paper being round about 6 per cent. The price of
                        bar gold was fixed on Monday #d. lower than last week, and is now quoted
                        77/103.</p>

                    <p>The- silver market has fallen away again this week, the , quotation for
                        immediate delivery being down to 25 on Tuesday. On Wednesday the tone was
                        better, and the price recovered 3/8, but yesterday it was again down to
                        25</p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>A much quieter tone has prevailed on the Stock Exchange during the past week.
                        One reason for this is that the arrangement of the account has occupied a
                        good deal of time, and in the early part of the week there was little
                        disposition to open new commitments until this was out of the way, and the
                        real extent of the speculative position made known. Dealings during the
                        fortnight has been on a fairly large scale, and it was evident that the
                        speculators had been active. America continues an unsettling feature, the
                        reports from the otherside being anything but bright. There have been more
                        important failures, and the frequency of the tragedies traceable to the
                        crisis serve to accentuate the feeling of depression. There is a feeling
                        here that further liquidation of unsound positions must take place before
                        any real improvement in the situation can be expected. </p>
                    <p>The near approach of the Christmas holidays is also operating against active
                        dealings. The arrangement proposed between the Great Northern and Great
                        Central Railways continues to excite much discussion. No official statement
                        of the proposals has yet been published, but what are regarded as probable
                        accurate forecasts have appeared in several papers, and the general opinion
                        appears to be that what the two companies propose to carry out is nothing
                        less than the formation of a trust, both concerns being placed under one
                        manager, and the recipts and expenses pooled. A considerable saving in
                        working expenses would thus be affected, and it is probable that similar
                        arrangments between some of the other companies would quickly follow.</p>
                    <p>Consols.</p>
                    <p>Gilt-edged stocks were dull at the beginning, and Consols fell away. During
                        the past two or three days the market, has been quiet, and Consols closed
                        last night at 82, }§. To-day Consols have shed 1/16 for cash and
                        account.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>The foreign market has been quiet. Russians have not shown much movement, and
                        last night's closing prices were practically anchan- ged on the week.
                        Japanese issues have been rather offered, and close lower, the First Series
                        of 44 1/2% closing last night at 90 1/4, as compared with 90 5/8 a week ago.
                        To-day these have gained 1/8.</p>
                    <p>Russian Fives have to-day avanced 3/4 to 90,</p>
                    <p>and the Foors 1/2 to 82 1/4}</p>
                    <p>Home Rallis.</p>
                    <p>During the past account there have been heavy dealings in home railway
                        shares, es- pecially in Great Northern and Great Central and there has been
                        no small amount of gramb ling at the heavy contangoe rates charged by the
                        banks. On the heavy lines these were us- ually about 8 per cent. bat in the
                        case of the two companies mentioned above the rates were as high as 12 1/2
                        and 15%, thus pointing to the existence of a large speculative account.
                        There were extensive dealings in York Deferred on Monday, and the price at
                        one time went to 48. 1/16. but profit taking has since caused a decline.
                        Yesterday these shares closed with a loss of 5/8, at 47 1/8.</p>
                    <p>Americans.</p>
                    <p>Shares in this market, show no decided im- proévement, and have moved
                        spasmodically For the most part changes are against holders The situation is
                        still too uncertain to permit of much business being done in Americans on
                        this side. Yesterday the market brightened a little on the announcement that
                        as President Mr. Roosevelt had definitely decided not to stand for
                        re-election, but the buying was chiefly attributed to nervous bears.</p>

                    <p>INVALUABLE FOR CHILDREN.</p>
                    <p>St. Vitos' Dance is a terrible nervous</p>
                    <p>malady which brings despair to many parents.</p>
                    <p>Yet it is a complaint which is cored rapidly</p>
                    <p>and completely by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills</p>
                    <p>-| for Pale People, incontrovertible evidence of</p>
                    <p>which has been received in many testimonials.</p>

                    <p>Pontorson (Manche), informed us of the cure</p>
                    <p>of his son, in the letter given below :</p>
                    <p>"For more than a year, my son Georges,</p>
                    <p>. | aged eleven years, was a victim of St. Vitas'</p>
                    <p>Mr. | Dance, and in spite of all our care his condition</p>
                    <p>. | became worse and worse. The child became</p>
                    <p>exhausted, and naturally we were greatly</p>
                    <p>upset. Happily, however, we were advised</p>
                    <p>to give him Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. From</p>
                    <p>the first box it was easy to see that he was</p>
                    <p>getting better. In all he took three boxes, and</p>
                    <p>completely cured, he was soon able to return</p>
                    <p>to school. His health is now excellent, he eats</p>
                    <p>well, and his appearance is healthy. He no</p>
