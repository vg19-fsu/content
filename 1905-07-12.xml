                    <head>THE LATE GRAND MUFTI.</head>
                    <p>In Sheikh Mohamad Abdon, whose death occurred at Ramleh yesterday, Egypt has
                        lost a man who can ill be spared. His career was in many ways most
                        remarkable. The son of a simple village Sheikh, he took the highest honors
                        that Al Azhar could give in his 30th year, but instead of devoting himself
                        to the study of theology, or to that life of repose varied by occasional
                        controversy on matters of dogma which is followed by so many Eastern
                        theologians, he sought more practical and beneficial objects and soon became
                        editor of the "Journal Officiel" of the day. Those were the later years of
                        Ismail Pasha, when a huge debt and oppressive methods of administration were
                        sowing the seeds of revolution; and Sheikh Mohamed Abdou's liberal
                        sympathies were roused by the spectacle of the Egyptian people staggering
                        under the burden laid upon it by grasping Ministers and exorbitant foreign
                        creditors, from the bondholders to the petty usurers who plied their trade
                        in every village. He joined the Arabist party in 1882, animated by the hope
                        that some remedy might be found for the misfortunes of his country, and did
                        his utmost to keep the Nationalist cause unstained by fanatical excess.</p>
                    <p>He failed, but had the revolutionary leaders been men of equal moral fibre,
                        and imbued by as liberal ideas, the history of Egypt might have taken a very
                        different course. The revolution failed and Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was exiled.
                        He withdrew to Beyrout, where he devoted himself to the study of theology
                        and philosophy, acquiring a far wider knowledge of these subjects than
                        almost any living Moslem, and devoting great attention to the various
                        European systems of philosophical thought. His energy in the cause of
                        charity and education was unbounded, and did not distinguish between
                        Christian or Moslem, Jew or Druse. Even the most conservative and fanatical
                        of his opponents admired him, and his marriage with the daughter of Sheikh
                        Hamada, a well-born and venerable Moslem of Beyrout, was made the occasion
                        of great rejoicing.</p>
                    <p>On his return from banishment, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou showed himself, as ever,
                        a partisan of justice and reform. He was appointed judge of the Native Court
                        of First Instance at Benha in 1892, and showed that neither his exile nor
                        his theologioal training had unfitted him for legal eminence. He rose to a
                        judgeship in the Court of Appeal and in 1899 replaced Sheikh Hassouna el
                        Nawawi as Grand Mufti of Egypt, after being previously appointed a member of
                        the council of administration of his old University of Al Azhar. Unlike his
                        predecessor, whose views were, and remain, uncompromisingly conservative,
                        Sheikh Mohamed Abdou showed himself a Liberal and a reformer in thought and
                        act. A Moslem "Broad Churchman"— if we may use the term —he had no reverence
                        for the "letter that killeth," and while a sturdy defender of the cardinal
                        points of the Moslem faith, had no patience with its numerous accretions
                        which have come down from pagan times or have been accepted by Moslems at a
                        later date, though quite unwarranted by the "noble Koran." This eagerness to
                        discover the living spirit of Islam, the true intentions of its great
                        founder, was manifested in his attitude towards marriage and the seclusion
                        of women. Sheikh Mohamed Abdou pointed out that the Koran admitted plural
                        marriage if a husband could treat his wives with equal justice and regard
                        them with equal affection, but that in practice this was an impossibility,
                        and that monogamy therefore was the only possible form of marriage to the
                        civilised man. He condemned the seclusion of women as being post-Islamio in
                        its origin, a practice introduced from the further East, baneful in its
                        effects and unwarranted by the precepts and the practice of the first and
                        most glorious centuries of Islam. His eagerness to promote and support
                        female education in Egypt was well-known, and he was a strong and undaunted
                        opponent of all forms of obscurantism.</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Abdou's zeal for good works was immense—and practical. He preferred
                        the foundation of technical schools to indiscriminate alms-giving, though
                        always ready to assist the needy and helpless. His tolerance and
                        fair-mindedness in religious questions—which are unhappily not shared by
                        some of his critics—were the signs, not of latitudinarianism, as his
                        opponents pretended, but of an enlightened and liberal faith. Christian
                        missionaries and Indian philosophers, Orientalists and students of all
                        creeds and nationalities who visited him were charmed by his urbanity and
                        astonished by the wide range of his knowledge. His relations, with the
                        Ministry of Justice, with which he was continually brought in contact, were
                        most cordial, and all British and Egyptian officials who were privileged to
                        make his acquaintance found in him not only an erudite scholar, but an able
                        and liberal-minded man of affairs. That he should have made enemies was
                        inevitable. The path of the reformer in the East is strewn with thorns, and
                        the last two years of the Grand Mufti's life were to some extent embittered
                        by the intrigues of which he was made a victim, and which culminated in the
                        denunciation of his father-in-law to the Turkish authorities in Syria. This
                        blow undoubtedly hastened the end of the distinguished Sheikh, who had
                        already been compelled to resign his position in the administration of the
                        University of Al Azhar through an ignoble intrigue in which certain
                        prominent Nationalists played an unworthy part. His ideas were perhaps too
                        far in advance of the times to have been appreciated by the mass of his
                        co-religionists, he was perhaps too careless of the feelings of the
                        religious conservatives of Islam, and his influence among the Moslems of
                        India and the Near East aroused jealousy in Egypt and suspicion in Turkey.
                        But his deeds will bear fruit in the future ; a new school of cultured and
                        Liberal Moslems may yet do him honor, and his "Nationalist'' opponents will
                        blush one day to remember their attacks on a straightforward man who did
                        more for the mental and spiritual life of the modern Egyptians than any
                        other Moslem of his day. A worthy successor to Sheikh Mohamed Abdou will not
                        easily be found.</p>

                            and rust, has been patched and towed away from the harbour proper to the
                            back of the coal islands, there to remain for probably some time, as I
                            understand hitches have again occurred in the arrangements between those
                            interested as regards her ultimate disposal.</p>

                    <head>DEATH OF GRAND MUFTI.<lb/>FUNERAL AT CAIRO TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>We deeply regret to announce the death, which took place at Seffer, Ramleh,
                        at 5.15 p.m. yesterday, of Sheikh Mobamed Abdou, Grand Mufti of Egypt. The
                        deceased, who succumbed to cancer of the liver, had been ailing for some
                        considerable time past, but it was only within the past week that fears were
                        entertained of a fatal issue. Indeed, it was Sheikh Mohamed Abdou's
                        intention to have left a week or two ago on a voyage to Europe and Morocco.
                        However, "Man proposes and God disposes,'' and the sheikh who has done so
                        much, and seemed destined to do so much more, for the enlightenment of his
                        co-religionists has passed away at the comparatively early age of 57 years.
                        His death will be deeply mourned, not only by the Moslems in Egypt, and
                        indeed throughout the East, but by a large number of friends and admirers of
                        other faiths.</p>
                    <p>The deceased's body, which is to be interred at Cairo, was removed this
                        morning from Mohamed Bay Rasim's house at Seffer station, where he died, and
                        conveyed by tram-car to the Ramleh Railway terminus, where it arrived at 10
                        o'clock. On its arrival there the body was met by all the notables who were
                        able to be present, among whom we noticed the Acting Regent, Hussein Pasha
                        Fakhry, Riaz Pasha, Mazloum Pasha, Aziz Pasha Izzet, Undersecretary of State
                        for Foreign Affairs, Ibrahim Pasha Neguib, Under-Secretary, Ministry of the
                        Inferior, Mr. Mansfield de C. Findlay, British Charge d'Affaires, the
                        President of the Court of Appeal and other judges of the various Courts, in
                        their robes of office, the Sub-Governor, Abdul Halim Pasha Assem, Mahmoud
                        Pasha Fehmy, Mr. Ralli and many other members of the Municipality, the Cadi
                        of Alexandria and the Mufti Nakib el Ashraf, El Said Abdul Rahitn el
                        Dunerdachi, Mohamed Shakir, Sheikh el Ulema, etc. Escorted by detachments of
                        Cavalry, Infantry, Police, and Coastguardsmen, the pupils of the Orwa el
                        Woska and Makarim el Akhlak Schools, and the Porters' Benevolent Society,
                        the imposing procession started for Moharrem Bey station, where a special
                        train, which had been placed at the disposal of the family by the Railway
                        Administration, was in readiness to convey the body to Cairo.</p>
                    <p>This train left at 11 a.m. for Cairo, where it was due to arrive at 2 p.m.
                        Among those who accompanied the mortal remains of the late Grand Mufti to
                        the Capital were Mohamed Shakir, Sheik el-Ulema, and the other ulema of
                        Alexandria, besides the family and relatives of the deceased, who had come
                        down from Cairo to be present with him at the end. On their arrival at Cairo
                        the remains will be taken to the Al Azhar Mosque for the usual ceremony,
                        after which the interment will take place at El Megawreen Cemetery.</p>
                    <p>The late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou was born at Mehallet Nasr, Sheibrakhit
                        district, Behera, in 1848, his father being Sheikh Abdou, a cultivator. He
                        was educated at Al Azhar University and in the year 1295 A.H. received the
                        final certificate of the "Alimieh." He was appointed editor of the "Official
                        Journal," and having been accused of being one of the mutineers of the
                        revolution, was exiled and condemned in 1882. Going to Beyrout, he there
                        married the daughter of Sheikh Hamada. At Beyrout he engaged in religious
                        and theological studies, and was finally pardoned in 1892. Shortly after
                        arriving in Egypt he became judge of the Court of First Instance at Benha
                        and afterwards at Zagazig. He was then promoted to a judgeship in the Native
                        Court of Appeal. In June, 1899, he was appointed Grand Mufti of Egypt by
                        H.H, the Khedive in place of Sheikh Hassouna el Nawawi, and was a member of
                        the Council of Administration of Al Azhar from 1894 until his retirement
                        recently.</p>

                    <head>NILE BRIDGES.</head>
                    <p>We learn that no project for the construction of a bridge from Boulac to
                        Ghezireh has as yet been decided upon, but the question is receiving full
                        consideration at the hands of the officials of the Public Works Department,
                        who recognise the great advantage to be derived by direct communication with
                        Ghezireh by the continuation of Boulac road by means of bridge. Soundings
                        have been taken and various schemes have been examined, but no decision can
                        be arrived at until the return of the many Government officials who are at
                        present away on leave. We also learn that an offer for the supply of funds
                        has been made by a local syndicate. We are unable to learn the terms upon
                        which this offer was made, but the acceptance of it is, we understand, very
                        doubtful.</p>
                    <p>Before any such scheme can be finally fixed upon we anticipate seeing the
                        work of widening the Kasr el Nil Bridge started, and this will be a great
                        advantage for its present width makes it altogether inadequate for the
                        immense amount of traffic which passes over it. The work will, we
                        understand, be commenced before the completion of the bridge at present in
                        course of construction at Rodah, and therefore there will be no means of
                        decreasing the traffic, which will of necessity become much more congested
                        by the space which will be sacrificed to the work of widening. Would it not
                        be better to delay the alteration of the Kasr el Nil Bridge until such time
                        as there is another bridge to relieve the traffic to some extent ?</p>

                    <p>The number of feddans of land under cotton cultivation in the Behera attacked
                        by the cotton worm amounted on the 8th inst. to no less than 40,443. The
                        largest infected area is in the markazes of Teh el Baroud and Kafr Dawar,
                        and the number of boys available in these markazes having been exhausted,
                        reinforcements were drafted in from Sheibrakhit and Damanhour. It having,
                        however, been found that the total number of corvéables in the whole
                        province was no longer sufficient to cope with the pest, the Ministry of the
                        Interior authorised the importation of 800 boys from Gharbieh, and within 24
                        hours of the reception of the order the whole number was despatched and
                        placed at the disposal of the Moudir of Behera. It is hoped that the total
                        number now engaged in Behera province, more than 50,273, will suffice to
                        deal with the eggs as fast as they are laid and avert the possibility of

                        <p>The newly-founded financial establishment, the Orient Bank, will open its
                            branches in Cairo and Alexandria very shortly. Messrs. Frankoudi and
                            Rodocanachi have been appointed managers of these branches, the first at
                            Cairo and the other at Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>I hear that still another financial estahlishment is to be founded here,
                            with the object of increasing the commercial relations batween Egypt and
                            Turkey. The amount of the capital will be 250,000 Turkish pounds, and
                            its title will be "Société Financière pour le Commerce et l'lndustrie."
                            The statutes of the company have been sent to the Grand Viziriete and
                            the Ottoman Ministry of Commerce. The project is signed by Emir Zadé,
                            Khalil Bey, and M. Tchimara.</p>
                        <p>It is announced that a group of Hellenes, natives of Volo, have decided
                            to create a Thessalian Steamship Company, with a regular service between
                            Egypt, Constantinople, and the ports of the Black Sea. The object of
                            this company is to facilitate the exportation of the products of
                            Thessaly to Egypt and Turkey. It is announced also that negotiations
                            have been opened for the purchase of three new steamers of 5,000 tons
                            each, with a speed of from 15 to 17 knots.</p>

                    <head>THE MAKING OF THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>A little while ago a paragraph in "The African World" announced the fact that
                        the Suakin Railway would be completed early next year. Subsequent advices
                        show that the work of construction is being pushed ahead with commendable
                        energy. The value of the line to the Sudan and its population cannot be
                        over-estimated. It will carry goods from Khartoum to the sea in twenty-four
                        hours, where six days are now required for transportation along the 1,500
                        miles of rail and river between the Sudan and the Egyptian ports. The
                        advantages of the new arrangement are so manifest as hardly to need mention.
                        It is safe to say that no single factor will contribute so largely to the
                        development of the great territory won from the Mahdi. The Sudan is capable
                        of great fruitfulness. Cotton and grain it should produce in abundance. But
                        markets are essential. The Suakin Railway provides the shortest cut to the
                        markets, which, without that or another railway, might, so far as the Sudan
                        is concerned, as well be non-existent. ("African World")</p>

                    <head>A PORT SAID NUISANCE.</head>
                    <p>A Port Said correspondent writes:—One wonders how long the suffering
                        inhabitants of Port Said will pot up with the incessant whistling from
                        steamers and tugs. There is no reason for it, the signals are meaningless
                        and not in conformity with the International Code; they are also misleading.
                        The Germans are the worst offenders, but they cannot take a ship in or out
                        of port without music. Once upon a time a steamer that whistled for her
                        agent had to wait half-an-hour after the last performance, but that good
                        rule has dropped into abeyance. In Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, etc.,
                        anybody can indulge in the luxury of waking the town up with the whistle,
                        but he has to pay a heavy fine for his fun, and there is no reason why it
                        should not be same at Port Said. Steamers also leave their masthead and
                        sidelights on when fast to the buoys in a most casual manner, so that it is
                        impossible to tell if they are under weigh or not: this will lead to a
                        serious accident some day.</p>

                            races not having received quite as much support as was hoped they will
                            all be left open until the 1st October next and other subscriptions can

                            altered, viz.: L.E. 100 to the 1st horse with a sweepstakesof L.E. 2 to

                    <head>ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</head>
                    <byline>BY P. P. G.</byline>
                    <head type="sub">VIII.</head>
                    <p>While I walked about the slopes N. of Ma'ân and watched the trains steaming
                        out with railway material, sleepers, rails, ballast, and so forth to carry
                        on the line to the south, I suddenly noticed that it was growing strangely
                        dark and that a brutally cold wind had sprung up. I next discovered that it
                        was raining half a mile away and that the rain was moving rapidly in my
                        direction. There was no sort of shelter anywhere near me : I was a good mile
                        from the station, the nearest tents were a good half-mile away, and it
                        struck me that a European rushing into a tent might cause considerable
                        surprise and annoyance to its occupants. In this I was mistaken for there
                        were several Italian workmen at Ma'ân, and soldiers were quite familiar with
                        the sight of Europeans, but had I thus sought refuge the chances were in
                        favor of my getting into a tent where Turkish women were quartered and
                        causing a panic among their spouses. One always does the wrong thing under
                        such circumstances, and after my experience with the tinned meat I had no
                        desire to tempt fortune any farther.</p>
                    <p>The rain arrived while I was looking aimlessly about me, preceded by a
                        violent gale that caught up all the dust in the desert for the rain which
                        followed it to lay again. Then came the rain and soaked me to the skin but
                        brought its recompense with it. While I ran down a gully looking for some
                        cleft or projecting rock where I could take cover, I put up two gazelles
                        which dashed like the wind across the wadi, disappeared over a slope, and
                        appeared again a moment later like two brown flecks on the black plain that
                        ran eastward.</p>
                    <p>When I got back to the station I found a Circassian, who was helping the
                        Greek station-master, and would no doubt become a station-master himself one
                        day. He frowned and made fearful grimaces, which were emphasised by the
                        rugged ferocity of his features, over what appeared to be a piece of simple
                        addition. M. Nikola, the station-master, turned to me from time to time with
                        a resigned gesture of amused contempt while his subordinate, gripping the
                        pen as if it were a dagger, made error after error, which he corrected with
                        the aid of sand and a stout penknife. M. Nikola ordered tea with lemons
                        (Ma'ân supplies no milk) and we drank, the Circassian in particular
                        disposing of several cups and dipping his pen into ink or tea with a sublime
                        indifference.</p>
                    <p>The station-master was called away, the Circassian put away his papers, eyed
                        me, and then said something ending in—orsun. I took it to mean "can you
                        speak Turkish" and replied in my best kitchen Arabic, that splendid language
                        spoken by Englishmen to their Egyptian servants and learnt from the
                        industrious Berberin, who, as everyone knows has<hi rend="italic">such</hi>a
                        good pronunciation of Arabic. To my joy the Tcherkess answered me in equally
                        bad and simple Arabic, and we conversed with numerous pauses while we
                        wrestled with the right phrases that refused to be uttered or even
                        remembered. A soldier from Aleppo grinned at our Arabic solecisms and threw
                        in a word now and again.</p>
                    <p>Yes ! I came from Egypt and Aziz Effendim from—well, I doubt if he knew
                        himself. He had been in Egypt, had seen the Zoological Gardens, where an
                        elephant had impressed him, and knew the Mousky quarter. He also had been to
                        a theatre in the Esbekieh. Fearing "startling disclosures" I changed the
                        subject and asked him how he liked Egypt . . but alas ! he absolutely
                        refused to puff the British Occupation or say a word for the Agency. The
                        utmost he would allow was that Lord Cromer was skilled in "politika." For
                        him Egypt was a hopeless place where you could not ride about after the
                        manner of Hybrias the Cretan, armed and overbearing, and where fighting was
                        forbidden. His brother had been as far as Italy and had fought a duel there.
                        He himself had been to Aleppo, where the people were like mules, bastards,
                        neither Turk nor Arab (this to the address of the Halebi soldier), and
                        thieves. He had been at Diarbekir and Kharpat in the time of the troubles,
                        where he killed three Armenians with his revolver while they ran, and "we
                        destroyed all of them and burnt their houses." Inshallah, there would be a
                        war with the Bulgarians soon. As for the Ingliz, why did they wish to take
                        Arabia and sell guns to the rebels? This to my address.</p>

                    <p>Few things are more remarkable in the intellectual development of the last
                        quarter of a century than the growth of archæology as a serious study, no
                        longer to be regarded, like Latin verses, as an elegance or added charm to
                        scholarship. It has altered the whole attitude of men's minds towards
                        antiquity, and, to seek an analogy in a widely different quarter, may be
                        compared to the substitution of oral evidence for affidavits in the Court of
                        Chancery. The ancient tomb or inscription, statue or remains of a temple,
                        like the living word of the witness, are more likely to tell the truth than
                        any writing. In no department has the progress been more striking than in
                        Egyptology. A few years ago there was at most one exhibition in the year for
                        showing the work done ; now there are always two or three, and the progress
                        has been so great as to make necessary a division of labour. Thus there is
                        now open, for a month, in the library of the Society of Biblical Arcbæology,
                        37, Great Russell street, London, a most interesting display of antiquities,
                        mainly from the eleventh dynasty temple at Deire, Bahari, found daring last
                        season's work by Dr. Edouard Naville and Mr. Hall. This funerary temple of
                        King Neb-hapet-Ra Meutuhetep (ILL) was discovered in the preceding season,
                        1903 4, and lies to the south of the great temple built by Queen Hatshepsu.
                        Two thirds of it have now been cleared away, and it is hoped that further
                        search may disclose the pyramid tomb of the King himself, which was called
                        Akh-asset, "Glorious are its seats." From the site the explorers have been
                        allowed to bring home— for distribution among various museums — many
                        valuable, though fragmentary, remains. Had they been more perfect they would
                        perforce have been retained m Egypt. They are of exceptional interest as
                        including specimens of high relief work of which no other examples appear to
                        be extant, and they belong to tho eleventh dynasty, of which we had very
                        little knowledge. These remains have, in fact, opened a new chapter of
                        Egyptian art. The craftsmen of Egypt, like the architects of medieval
                        Cathedrals, are usually unknown by name ; but in this instance the name of
                        the chief artist has come down to us. He was Mertisen, who describes himself
                        on his tombstone as a master of artistic skill which he handed down to his
                        son. It is thought that he was the inaugurator of a new birth of Egyptian
                        art, just as his master, Neb-hap8t-Ra Mentuhetep, was the refounder of the
                        Egyptian kingdom under the headship of the Thebans. Of another King,
                        Usertsen III., three massive statues of black granite—mutilated, it is true,
                        but not to such an extent as to conceal the character of the face—are shown.
                        They represent him at different periods of his life, with a face rather of a
                        European than of an Egyptian or Semitic type. 'The mouth is large, but the
                        lips are thin and firm, and the nose would appear to have been somewhat
                        aquiline. The ears are of enormous size. What appears to be the earliest
                        instance of the newly-discovered eleventh dynasty style of high coloured
                        relief is the seated portrait figure of a Queen or priestess named Nefer
                        shushusa. There are also other similar figures—one with a flower in the left
                        hand, and another smelling a flower. A relief of a King holding the hand of
                        a Queen seems to commemorate a chief of the hunters of the desert by its
                        peculiarly cut inscription. From the shrine of the priestesses comes another
                        high relief sculpture of a man who is represented with the person below him
                        as walking in the temple. The remarkable feature of this fragment is a
                        "proto-Doric" octagonal column, and the whole affords interesting evidence
                        of the actual appearance of the columns of the ambulatory surrounding the
                        pyramid» To the left are two fragments showing the hinder parts of a dog and
                        of a man binding a bull for sacrifice, and above is one of the sacred cows
                        of Hathor licking her calf. Pieces of purely Theban work are two fragments
                        from scenes representing King Mentuhetep and his wife. On the right-hand one
                        is seen the upper part of tho Royal crown, and the beautifully carved
                        hieroglyphs and the wonderful prdservation of colour give singular interest
                        and charm to these remains. The inscriptions refer to the queen (Aashait). A
                        complete slab of this type is kept back in the Cairo Museum. A variety of
                        other objects assignable to this period are also shown—the King overthrowing
                        an Aamn, warriors armed with axes, boatmen, and reliefs of animals. The
                        drawing of the latter, notably a flamingo, is marvellously free and
                        accurate.</p>
                    <p>The specimens of later dynasties are of no inferior value and interest. The
                        most beautiful, perhaps, of the objects displayed is an alabaster head of a
                        cow, ascribed to the eighteenth dynasty. The sculpture is wonderfully true
                        to life. The eyes were inlaid with lapis, of which traces remain, and the
                        ears and horns were probably of silver. The cow was probably from a figure
                        of the goddess Hathor, dedicated in the Hathor shrine of the Great Temple. A
                        portion of a large funerary stela commemorates Userhat, priest of the
                        deceased Kings Amen-hotep III. and Tut-ankh-amen, and his wife, the singer
                        of Amen, Nefretari. These are ascribed to the early nineteenth dynasty.There
                        is also a great number of smaller objects— beads,blue-glazed faience, vases,
                        hieratic ostraka containing lists of names, accounts, letters, a literary
                        text, and a list of hieroglyphs which may have been school exercises. It
                        remains to b3 said that Dr. Borchardt contributes a series of very beautiful
                        photographs of the temple, and that Mme. Naville has made some admirable
                        coloured drawings of cows from the eleventh dynasty sarcophagi. It is
                        somewhat curious that the draghtsmanship displayed in work presumably of the
                        same age is very unequal. Some of the cows are freely and nataralistically
                        drawn, whilst others are conventional to the degree of being almost wooden.

                        <p>The House of Commons was again occupied yesterday with the debate upon
                            the Aliens Bill. That is the third full Parliamentary day devoted to the
                            Committee on this measure, and the House has not reached the middle of
                            the first clause. The amendments have been uniformly directed to making
                            the Bill unworkable, or intolerably cumbrous. It is merely a measure of
                            police for the protection of ratepayers from burdens which ought not to
                            be placed upon them, of English workmen from being crowded out of home
                            and employment by some of the lowest populations of Europe, and of
                            society at large from persons incapable of making good citizens. It is
                            constantly treated by the Opposition as if it were an invasion of the
                            rights of man and an attack upon the privileges of persons more worthy
                            of our care than the subjects of the King.</p>

                        <p>The Radicals find themselves in a dilemma, which, as usual, they have
                            made for them selves ; as a witty lady said at the beginning of the last
                            century, "I've often heard of people running their heads against stone
                            walls, but I never knew of any but the Whigs who built stone walls to
                            run their heads against" No Radical supports. in ' theory the strange
                            anomaly by which one Member of Parliament represents what may be called
                            a, one-vote power, while another, with only the same privileges in the
                            House of Commons, stands for a ten-vote power. Radicals are mostly
                            ideologues, and equal electoral districts would best coincide with their
                            absurd theories about the literal equality of men, and for that matter
                            of women and men. Why not of men, women, and children Î Therefore, they
                            cannot conscientiously oppose the principle of redistribution.</p>

                        <p>If Parliament took a real interest in economy and efficiency for the Army
                            some member would ask for a return showing the number of officers

                            troops in the command, on the one hand, in each British command, and, on
                            the other hand, in a normal French or German division and Army Corps.
                            That return, we suspect, would astonish the House of Commons even more

                        <p>The suggestion which has been made—it may almost be called a threat—that
                            certain highly placed officials should be impeached, under certain
                            circumstances, in connection with the War Stores scandal, at once takes
                            us back to the days of an earlier generation. One had imagined that
                            Warren Hastings was the last great example of a great impeachment. To
                            day he affair would be less picturesque and dramatic, if not essentially
                            less tragic. Tho galaxy of oratorical talent that made that protracted
                            trial so astounding has passed with the classics from the House of
                            Commons, and oratory as an art is on the down grade. There is, of
                            course, the possibility that an impeachment might serve to revive this
                            lost art, though the possibility lends no sufficient attracting* to the
                            prospect.</p>

                            <p>Another important article by M. Jules Delafosse, which has made a
                                deep impression in Paris, has appeared in the "Echo de Paris." He
                                says that France is willing to conclude an understanding with
                                Germany, because that implies a régime of peace, but she will not
                                conclude an alliance with her, because that involves chances of war
                                contrary to the interests of France. M. Delafosse then inquires what
                                the German Emperor had to reproach France with as regards Morocco.
                                His answer is, absolutely nothing. The German Emperor demanded in
                                haughty terms the territorial integrity of Morocco, the independence
                                of the Sultan, and the open door. But those three points were
                                distinctly accepted in the text of the Franco English Agreement.

                            <p>The "Cologne Gazette" declares that in view of the reservations with
                                which M. Ronvier has doubtless accompanied his consent, in this
                                question it is impossible to speak of victor or vanquished. The
                                lesson of the "Franco-German incident" is described as being that
                                "reforms in Morocco can only be achieved by means of an
                                international understanding aid not by the initiative of a single

                        PEOPLE.</head>
                    <p>Though sharing the traditional reluctance of our old nobility to emerge from
                        aristocratic privacy and come before the public-as the subject of a
                        newspaper article, the Right Hon. Lady Haldon has expressly permitted the
                        publication of a statement recently made to a representative of the Press
                        regarding her wonderful cure by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.</p>
                    <p>Recognising that the words of a titled lady in her position must necessarily
                        bear great' weight with the public, and earnestly<figure>

                        </figure>desiring that the benefits she had derived from Dr. Williams' Pink
                        Pills should be publicly acknowledged. Lady Haldon waived all personal
                        reluctance and told a story which cannot but impress every reader.</p>
                    <p>'For the sake of all sufferers," said her ladyship, "I want to tell you what
                        Dr. Williams* Pink "Pills for Pale People did for me when I had given up all
                        hope, after tho best professional treatment.</p>
                    <p>'I have been a great traveller. Five years ago, when residing Tn Australia,
                        my heart became seriously affected. Symptoms of advanced Anaemia showed
                        themselves. One of the results was most acute Indigestion. I suffered
                        severely in the back and under the shoulder blades, including an especially
                        severe oppression of the chest. The most careful diet brought no relief.
                        Even after a glass of water my discomfort was almost unbearable. Food of any
                        kind caused me snob misery that I ate less and less, till I was practically
                        starving myself. In walking the shortest distance palpitations of the heart
                        would make me feel as though I were suffocating.</p>
                    <p>"As anæmia developed I grew alarmingly ill ; I could not sleep at night ; my
                        whole system was deranged. My nerves broke down, my bead ached constantly,
                        until my eyesight became affected.</p>
                    <p>"My illness seemed so deeply rooted that I determined to go to the Clinique
                        de la Caroline, in Switzerland, where I was attended by eminent
                        physicians.</p>
                    <p>"But about August, 1903, while I was travelling by train and nearly prostrate
                        with one<cb n="4"/>of my attacks, I casually picked up a small pamphlet
                        referring to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. I became so
                        interested in some cures mentioned therein that I determined to give a trial
                        to this medicine.</p>
                    <p>"Within three days I was astonished at the marvelous improvement. I procured
                        further boxes of the pills, and very soon I was delighted to find that all
                        traces of my complaint had practically vanished.</p>
                    <p>"I could now walk long distances with an entire freedom from pain. My
                        appetite had returned with a heartiness that surprised me, and my general
                        health was suoh as I had not enjoyed for many years."</p>
                    <p>In every class of society the curative powers of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        have been proved repeatedly in diseases arising from too little or
                        impoverished blood. For men as well as women they are invaluable in Anæmia,
                        Indigestion, excessive weakness, Decline, Consumption, Rheumatism, Sciatica,
                        Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, Nervous Disorders. Dr. Williams' Medicine Co.,

                    <head>POLICE NEWS FROM MOROCCO.</head>
                    <p>Moorish society knows no class distinctions, save that a man is rich or poor,
                        official or non- official, saintly or ordinary. Fear causes deference to be
                        paid to men of certain bodily girth, because that girth connotes official
                        standing. Piety demands and obtains deference for the blind, mad, and
                        palpably ascetic, and for shareefs, because all such are saints or akin to
                        saints. There is no aristocracy in Sunset Land, no question of social
                        standing. Half-bred negroes have held high official posts, if not the Green
                        Parasol itself ; a slave-born Sultan rules the land to-day, or tries to ;
                        and the brother of Hadji Mohammed Torres, the oldest and most highly
                        respected Minister the Moorish Government has had in a century, used to make
                        slippers and mend riding boots for me, and for other equally humble folk, in
                        the shadow of the official residence.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of power and ability to acquire wealth one would place the
                        Court favorites first, then the country governors (of whom I wrote in
                        another article). and then the Bashas and Khaleefas of towns. Your Basha is
                        a sort of Lord Mayor, with the powers of a General Trepoff; his Khaleefa is
                        the Police Magistrate. Even a Khaleefa, if he has his wits about him, can
                        pick up a fairly handsome living in a Moorish town ; but naturally the Basha
                        takes the cream unto himself, and, if he hears of a case promising
                        substantial bribery being tried in the Khaleefate, he orders its transfer to
                        his own court, which is held daily in the city kasbah, under an awning of
                        the Basha's front door, or, as I have seen it before now, under the eaves of
                        a stable-yard.</p>
                    <p>Wherever they may be held, the Basha's courts do not vary much. The Basha
                        sits or reclines on cushions, a taleb or scribe near by, and the
                        propitiatory gifts of litigants, from a loaf of sugar or a packet of candles
                        to a bag of dollars, ranged suggestively beside him. A few of his soldiers,
                        generally the most unashamed and rascally libertines of the neighbourhood,
                        are always within hail, for in the midst of a heated argument, or when
                        presents come in but poorly, the Basha is apt to order a general thwacking
                        to be administered on the spot, or to bundle everyone concerned in the case
                        before him off to prison, there to cool their heels and minds, and reflect
                        upon the evils of</p>
                    <p>No record is kept of punishments administered, and the judge rarely mentions
                        any term in ordering a man to prison, the duration of a sentence depending
                        generally upon the nature of the overtures subsequently made to the Basha by
                        the offenders' friends. Petty cases, street troubles, and the like, in which
                        defendants and plaintiffs are not likely to make presents of many shillings
                        in value and serious penalties are not involved, are mostly dealt with in
                        the lesser court, which is presided over by the Basha's lieutenant, the
                        Khaleefa. Cases which we should call civil, as distinguished from criminal,
                        matters involving reference to religious law, mosque property, and the like,
                        go to a third court, presided over by the Kadi, a learned man, not greatly
                        given to the acceptance of bribes, and obliged by law to make record of all
                        his decisions.</p>
                    <p>Seriously considered, one is bound to admit that the Moorish courts are
                        veritable sinks of chicanery, injustice, and venal paltering with the
                        country's curse—palm-oil. The only thing to be said in their favor is that
                        they do something toward discouraging appeals to the law, since prosecutor
                        and prosecuted stand a wonderfully good chance of being soundly trounced as
                        well as mulcted in bribes, and this, since all Orientals are over-much given
                        to litigation, is good. But when a Moor really desires justice in a vital
                        matter, vengeance upon a murderer or an adulterer, for example, he sharpens
                        his curved dagger, primes his long flint-lock musket, invokes Allah's
                        blessing on his errand, and sets out to combine the offices of judge and
                        executioner in his own person by slaying the offender at sight. His right to
                        do this is recognised. </p>
                    <p>Indeed, such a course is expected of him, though the acceptance of blood
                        money is in certain cases allowed to wipe out a blood debt. Theoretically, a
                        Kadi may Dot send a man to prison for more than three days, without
                        providing a written statement of his offence and sentence. Actually, any man
                        having means may send almost any unprotected Moor (one not under the
                        protection of a foreign consulate) to prison for any period, or have him
                        beaten, within safe limits, by simply communicating his desire, with a
                        sufficiency of material compliments to the Basha. And Europeans—even
                        European consuls — do not help to purify the Moorish courts in these
                        matters. "I sent that rascal up to the kasbah to be flogged this morning. He
                        had been tampering with my . ." is a remark I have heard more than once upon
                        European lips in Morocco ; and I know a much respected European consul
                        there, who had his Moorish servant cruelly flogged, and kept naked in a
                        dungeon, on the raw edge of starvation, for exactly one year, as punishment
                        for having plucked and eaten one ripe pear growing in an uncultivated garden
                        belonging to the consul. In studying the methods of Moorish courts, I found
                        my presence in the Khaleefa's court<cb n="2"/> apt to hamper the progress of
                        injustice. I was known for a "scribe and maker of devil business in books,"
                        and found his worship inclined to temper glaring roguery and tyranny with
                        slow, benevolent smiles of Oriental suavity in my direction. So, in the
                        interests of truth, I took to sending a confidential servant to court, and
                        getting my report second-hand. Here is a typical case :</p>
                    <p>Mohamet, a town-bred Moor, complained that Cassim, Riffi, had man-handled him
                        in the open market, and desired that the Riffian be beaten in the kasbash
                        for this. At the same time he spread before the Khaleefa a quite substantial
                        present : three dollars and a large loaf of sugar. His Worship grunted
                        cordially, and sent soldiers for Cassim, a splendid specimen of a mountain
                        man, with wild eyes which he kept downcast. And that was the loss of him ;
                        for even in Mahomet's prasence his eyes might well have telegraphed the
                        Khaleefa promise of a bribe. The Khaleefa allowed him a minute or two, and
                        then, seeing that he had an obdurate rascal to deal with—your Kaleefa
                        naturally prefers to do business with both sides, impartially—he shouted
                        :</p>
                    <p>So, dog, you will fall upon good Muslimin here in Tangier, and beat them, eh
                        ?" Then to the soldiers : "Take him to the prison and scourge him well—two
                        hundred strokes. Leave him there."</p>
                    <p>Cassim was dragged off, sullen, proud, silent mountain man that he was,
                        between two soldiers. Half an hour later, before entering the prison gates,
                        he was halted by a messenger and hrought back to the court, where he saw his
                        uncle, Abd el Selam, flushed and breathless, standing near the Khaleefa's
                        cushions. There was an extra bag of money at the Khaleefa's feet now ; it
                        contained no fewer than ten dollars. The Khaleefa eyed sullen Cassim with
                        great good humour ;</p>
                    <p>"How is this, Riffi ?" he began. "How comes it you did not tell me you did
                        not truly beat Mohamet ?" Cassim raised his smouldering eyes at legth.
                        "Lord, why should I talk of such street-bred cattle ?" quoth he. "The
                        beating I gave him was – " Here the Khaleefa interposed sharply : "Eh, eh ?
                        Shwei, shwei ! This my Court is not the market-place. I cannot have so much
                        noise. Go away, all of you !" "But, Lord " began complainant Mohamet.
                        "Outside ! Away with ye all, I say. Go anp talk to the Kadi !" That is : "Go
                        and hold your peace !" for the Kadi has no jurisdiction n such matters. So
                        the Riffian swaggered out into the sunshine, and Mohamet, crestfallen,
                        followed him, doubtless meditating a fresh scheme, in which he would be more
                        careful in the Matter of outbribing ; or, possibly, more wisely, resolving
                        to be quit of courts and law.</p>

                    <head>GERMANY AND FRANCE. </head>
                    <p>It is now clear that France will go to the Morocco Conference—but only upon
                        certain well-defined conditions. There will be no questions raised as to the
                        integrity of the Shereefian Empire, the sovereignty of the Sultan, the
                        validity of treaties between Morocco and other Powers, particularly that of
                        the Anglo-French and Franco-Spanish Conventions, or the special rights of
                        France by virtue of her common frontier with Morocco. All these matters,
                        therefore, being eliminated, what remains to be discussed ? And, in
                        particular, if the Conventions between England and France, and France and
                        Spain, are not to be questioned, what becomes of the alleged ground of the
                        German attempt to interfere with the mutual arrangements of those Powers ?
                        Really, if the Kaiser, his Government, and his people think they have scored
                        a diplomatic victory by bringing France, England, and Spain to a Conference
                        which is forbidden, in advance, to modify these Conventions, we can only say
                        that they are heartily welcome to all the glory they can sedulously extract
                        from the situation. Outsiders, however, will be all the more inclined to
                        doubt whether Germany would have taken so much trouble to gain so little.
                        The truth, of course, is that, as M. Jules Delafosse has just put it, in the
                        "Echo de Paris," the coup has been aimed at the Anglo-French entente : the
                        Kaiser "has been trying to compel us, by means of intimidation, to cancel an
                        agreement which he detests as much as he fears." Quod non erat
                        demonstrandum—but which has been demonstrated all the same.</p>

                    <p>The details of a somewhat remarkable surgical operation in skin-grafting have
                        been laid before the French Academy of Medicine. The subject was a person
                        who had had the lid and lashes of the left eye quite destroyed by burns. In
                        order to restore the lid, the surgeon conceived the idea of taking a piece
                        of skin from the left arm. This was done in two narrow strips, and the arm
                        was then fixed by a plaster apparatus in close contact with the newly
                        grafted lid. At the end of ten days the arm was released, and the operation
                        was found to have completely succeeded.</p>

                    <head>HONG KONG AT NIGHT. </head>
                    <byline>BY W. MONRO ANDERSON. </byline>
                    <p>A moment ago the peak was blanketed with a dense fog. It was as if the ebon
                        wings of Death hovered over the island. But now the Chinese mainland reveals
                        itself, and across the harbour and beyond Kowloon and beyond the paddy
                        fields the great mountains stand out black and wonderful against the sky.
                        The moon is racing between the cloud gaps and burnishing the face of the
                        waters and gleaming on the wetted sides of the steamers. Far to south you
                        can just see the lighthouse, the one- eyed sentry Gap Rook, blinking at the
                        masthead lights of the, ships that pass in the night. Between the light and
                        Hong Kong is the China Sea studded with islands, and in and out among the
                        islands great junks with bat-wing sails move like phantom things over the
                        leaden sea.</p>
                    <p>Far below the peak is the harbour, lit up by the liners and the cruisers and
                        the junks and the sampans that lie as thick as ants on a honey-pot. It is
                        the harbour of a million eyes, and a coolie leaning against a rickshaw
                        likens it unto heaven, top side down: Descending the mountain side brings
                        you to the harbour. Here is a little knot of people on the quay, and in
                        front of them a chow squatting on his haunches with a bamboo sticking out
                        over the water. From the end of the bamboo four strings run down and out,
                        pyramid fashion, into the water. The bamboo bends, and the putty-faced man
                        on the quay rises and lifts the bamboo over his head. The four strings
                        become taut, and out of the black water a net appears swarming with small
                        fry, and the putty-faced man is pleased. I fished all day over the side of a
                        tramp, and caught nothing. The Chinese firemen coming out of the blackness
                        of the stokehold, their bare back streaming with ink, looked at me with
                        utter contempt. Yet here is this grinning coolie sinking his ragged net
                        anywhere in the harbour and performing miracles. His ancestors must have
                        dwelt on the shores of Galilee.</p>
                    <p>The sampans and the junks have all anchored off some distance from the quay.
                        This is the law of Hong Kong, for otherwise the army of sampan men might
                        step ashore and seize the island in the dark watches of the night. The quay
                        is full of life, for the night is warm and the merchants, arrayed in purple
                        and fine linen, are strolling in the moonlight. Mr. Wokee is attired in a
                        flowing robe of white and pale blue baggy trousers. Trotting beside him is
                        little Wokee junior, arrayed in splendour gaudy as a butterfly. The children
                        are racing up and down, their rat-tailed queues tied with bows of pink and
                        blue. Over water from the lined-up sampans comes a woman's voice. She is
                        droning a Cantonese love song. There is six feet two of Sikh police in khaki
                        uniform. His beard is shining in the lamplight ; it is well trimmed and
                        black as jet. Around his leftwrist are two half-hitches of pigtail, and on
                        the end of the pigtail is a coolie revolving and wriggling like a
                        kangaroo-rat in a trap. The coolie is a desperate fellow ; you can see that
                        by his face, a face that must have broken all the commandments of the East
                        and West. There is a huge crowd following. It looks as if every coolie in
                        Hong Kong had formed up in the scrum behind the Sikh. Stray pieces of road
                        metal strike him, but he is not afraid, and his eyes are flashing and grand
                        to behold. The crowd is pressing in closer and showing tis long yellow
                        teeth. Their wiry hands, armed with inch finger nails, stab at the Sikh.
                        From his right wrist dangles a baton. The baton gives an angry little jerk
                        now and then like a dog's leg twitching with pain. A coolie, more desperate
                        than the rest, comes within range, hat the Sikh has eyes in the back of his
                        head. The long loose arm with the baton at the end swings round like a
                        catapult, and there is a nasty doll thud. The coolie sits in the dust
                        rubbing tobacco into a two-inch scalp wound, and wondering what he has been
                        doing since morning. Along the quay six more Sikhs reinforce their comrade,
                        and the crowd melts away to the gambling dens and the dice-box.</p>
                    <p>Queen street, the fashionable quarter of Hong Kong, is almost deserted, and
                        is cheerless, for there are no lights in the shop windows. There must be a
                        dog fight in the Chinese quarter and all the Queen-street folk have gone
                        there. You go that way too, and as you draw near a sound of revelry by night
                        fells on your ears. A steamer's siren hoots down on the quay. There is a
                        clash of brass and tinkling of cymbals, and a volley of crackers from the
                        steamer's bows. If that pandemonium otherwise known as Chinese music has not
                        terrified the "debil man" it is not the Chinaman's fault. I hear the thud of
                        the river steamer's paddles and the shouts and laughter of the coolie
                        passengers. The Sam-Sin is off to Canton.</p>
                    <p>The glow of light from the Chinese quarter almost blinds you at first. The
                        streets are full of lanterns, red and yellow and green and blue ; and blue
                        and green and yellow and red are some of the colours that adorn the crowd. I
                        hear the sound of the scraping of fiddles over the way and step over and
                        look in. At one end <cb n="4"/>of the room are about twenty sailors, British
                        and American, sitting on a long bench. At the other a bar with an array of
                        beer mugs. It looks like target practice. Behind the bar is a woman, the one
                        white woman I have seen to night, and her reminiscences will run into thirty
                        editions. In the comer is a low platform, about one foot high, and five feet
                        square, and on this two Filippinos, scraping violins. The sailors set to
                        partners, those that can stand, and circle slowly around the room with a
                        kind of movement that has the rock of the sea in it. The sailors who cannot
                        stand sit where they are and applaud. Everything seems a great success to
                        them. To-morrow they will be cooling their heads on the capstan.</p>
                    <p>A girl of eighteen is feeling her way along the shop fronts, her face painted
                        as gaudy barber's pole. Her dress is a dress of a million dyes, and all the
                        shades of sunset are blended there. Out of her smooth, expressionless, putty
                        face two beady eyes peep between the slanting lids. She must be blind. But
                        no ! She is groping along the shop fronts because her midget shoes are only
                        two-and-a-half inches long. And if you stood her out in the road she would
                        tumble over like a wooden doll. Little Chinese policemen with mushroom hats
                        patrol the winding streets. They surely cannot keep order. Half an hour ago
                        a coolie thought likewise, but now he is quite of another opinion as he sits
                        in a cell nursing a lamp on his scalp as big as a saucer.</p>
                    <p>Here is a restaurant. It has a front like a Buddhist temple. Some local swell
                        has just entered. Bang ! bang ! bang ! go the cymbal men inside the door.
                        That is in his honour.</p>
                    <p>A turn in the street and you see the harbour and the harbour lights. There
                        are half a dozen black shadows rising out of the water, the armourplated
                        sides of cruisers. Within these walls are men of Devon. Another long, low,
                        black alligator thing with two stumpy funnels is moving swiftly out of the
                        harbour like a thief in the night It is a destroyer off on patrol.</p>
                    <p>I have not seen a drank man as yet, and this is the poorest quarter of the
                        town. What a contrast to the alleys of Lambeth and the faces of the wild
                        beasts that scavenge the dustbins there !</p>
                    <p>The shutters are closing, the streets are emptying, and I only notice one
                        Sikh policeman and two men-of-war's men steering their sinuous way to the
                        quay side. How beautiful and wonderful is the sky ! It is quieter still. I
                        pass a shop, and through a crack in the shutters streams a faint light. I
                        peer through and into the room beyond the shop, and notice a dozen
                        putty-faced men beading over a low table. I hear the rattle, the rattle of
                        an inverted dice-cup. It is the first sound a Chinaman hears at birth. He
                        will listen for it when he wakes on Judgment Day.</p>

                    <head>A MAN AND HIS MONEY.</head>
                    <p>The rivalry of rich men in some directions is by no means to be discouraged.
                        Fired, perhaps, by the spectacle of Mr. Carnegie's educational largesse, Mr.
                        J. D. Rockefeller has begun to distribute money on the same lavish scale,
                        presenting £2,000,000 to the General Education Board of the United States
                        for the furtherance of its work, and making a separate gift of £200,000 to
                        the University of Yale. The former donation, it appears, is to be augmented
                        if its results are as beneficial as Mr. Rockeller hopes for, and the example
                        at any rate, mast augur well for the future of America's educational
                        resources. Inconnection with the Yale endowment, some fastidious people have
                        contended that, as the methods of Mr. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust are
                        not above reproach, his gift should be refused as coming from a tainted
                        source. But there is no practical sense in reasoning of this kind. If Mr.
                        Rockefeller is a kind of Mephistopheles, then it is surely all to the good
                        that money which he might use for Mephistophelian purposes should be
                        transferred to the hands of those who will turn it to better account.</p>

                    <head>ARMOUR v. SUBMARINES.</head>
                    <p>The terrible havoc caused in the Russian fleet by the Japanese torpedoes, and
                        by the progress made in submarines, has raised among naval architects the
                        problem of how to afford some protective armour. In one or two ships built
                        in France the armoured bridge has been carried vertically downward to the
                        bottom of the ship. Two German engineers however, seizing upon the fact that
                        submarine explosions decrease enormously in effect as the distance from the
                        hull increases, have calculated that an armour plate of two-thirds of an
                        inch would resist a charge of 112lb. of fulmi-cotton at a distance of 4ft.
                        lO 1/2in. To secure this, they propose ships with a triple hull, with 24 in.
                        of space between each, capable of being used a stove compartments. The
                        innermost wall of the three casings would be of nickel plates 1 3/4in. thick
                        at the sides, and 1 1/4 in. thick at the bottom. The estimated increase in
                        the weight of the ship is from 550 to 700 tons.</p>

                    <head>ROMANCE OF THE ROSETTA STONE. </head>
                    <p>In the summer of 1798 Alexandria fell into Napoleon's hands, and he set to
                        work to make the coast secure. One August day to 1799 it chanced that one of
                        his engineer officers, Andre Boussard, was directing the digging operations
                        for a new fort between the town of Rosetta and the sea, when the picks of
                        the sappers struck a black slab of basalt, 45in. long, which was observed to
                        be covered with three different styles of writing, of which the last was
                        obviously Greek. When this stone was carried up the Nile to Cairo and shown
                        to Napoleon and his savants, the value of it, says the "Sunday Strand," was
                        recognised at a glance.</p>
                    <p>While it lay in readiness to be conveyed to Paris, a British force made its
                        way to Egypt, laid siege to Alexandria, and captured the city in 1801. In
                        the treaty of capitulation the victors insisted, upon the delivery of all
                        the monuments collected, and among them the slab, which was known as the
                        Rosetta stone. This had been chosen by the vanquished General Menou as his
                        own, and was carefully wrapped in cloth and matting at his house in
                        Alexandria. Hither one day Colonel Tusner was sent by his chief with a
                        detachment of men, who carted it away, amid the jeers of the French
                        officers, and pot it aboard a frigate, whereon the colonel convoyed it with
                        care to the Thames.</p>
                    <p>Thus, one March day in 1802, the relic reached London—it is to-day one of the
                        priceless gems of the British Museum.</p>

                    <head>NEW CALEDONIA'S CRISIS. </head>
                    <p>A grave crisis is passing over the French colony of New Caledonia. The
                        Governor, who has just readied Paris, paints its economic condition to dark
                        colours. Commerce and agriculture are both in a bad way ; failures are
                        greatly on the increase, and a large number of colonists, absolutely ruined,
                        are petitioning: to be sent back to France. The Governor thinks that the
                        only chance for placing the colony in a condition of even decent comfort is
                        to develop its mineral wealth, which is considerable. The object of his
                        visit to Paris is to confer with the Minister of the Colonies on the serious
                        situation confronting the inhabitants of New Caledonia.</p>

                        burned about the feet. The parish priest Abbé Moreau was conducting service
                        at the altar at the time, and his vestments were badly burned. He himself
                        was scorched, but only slightly.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Era Bartho, 183 East 12th street, New York City, N. Y., writes:</p>
                    <p>"I suffered for three years with leucorrhea and ulceration of the womb. The
                        doctor advocated an operation which I dreaded very much, and strongly
                        objected to go under it. Now I am a changed woman, Peruna cured me ; it look
                        nine bottles, but I felt so much improved I kept taking it, as I dreaded an
                        operation so much. I am to-day in perfect health and have not felt so well
                        for fifteen years."—Mrs. Eva Bartho.</p>
                    <p>It is no longer a question as to whether Peruna can be relied on to cure all
                        such cases. During the many years in which Peruna has been put to test in
                        all forms and stages of acute and chronic catarrh no one year has put this
                        remedy to greater test than the past year. </p>
                    <p>If all the women who are suffering with any form of female weakness would
                        write to Dr. Hartman, Columbus, Ohio, and give him a complete description of
                        their symptoms and the peculiarities of their troubles, he will immediately

                    <p>Address Dr. Hartman, President of The Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus, Ohio.</p>

                        <head>Les Bains de mer</head>
                        <p>Encore une fillette qui vient de se noyer sur la plage de l'Ibrahimieh.
                            Des familles entières ne sachant plus où aller prennent leur bain aux
                            extrémités de Kaït Bey et de Silsileh. On peut même voir la file des
                            baignants se continuer jusqu'au Sporting Club. Aussi peut-on piévoir
                            pour la saison d'été une série d'accidents dont la Municipalité aura sa
                            part de responsabilité, puisqu'en s'opposant à la reconstruction de
                            bains au Port-Est elle force la population à faire usage d'emplacements
                            dangereux.</p>
                        <p>En effet, tandis que les fonctionnaires municipaux s'empressent
                            d'accorder des centaines de concessions pour l'occupation de voies
                            publiques où la circulation est déjà trop entravée, ils opposent une
                            indifférence et meme une hostilité systématique à tous ceux qui
                            demandent l'autorisation d'installer des établissement de bains. Dans le
                            premier cas, l'employé ne se contente pas d'accorder la concession, il
                            va lui-même chez le concessionnaire lui porter ses papiers ; dans le
                            second, au contraire l'entrepreneur ne rencontre que des tracasseries :
                            le gouvernorat le renvoie à la Municipalité, celle-ci aux gardes côtes,
                            ceux-ci à la Douane, aux Ports et Phares, aux bâtiments de l'Etat, aux
                            Ministères etc., tant et si bien que l'entrepreneur découragé renonce à
                            son dessein. Et cependant une concession de bains rapporte plus au
                            budget qu'une concession de trottoirs. Pourquoi donc cette différence
                            d'attitude de la part de la Municipalité ? Serait ce que les concessions
                            de la voie publique rapportent davantage a ses fonctionnaires ?</p>
                        <p>On le dit. En attendant le public souffre de la privation de bains.
                            Certains n'hésitent même pas à courir les dangers de la plage libre.

                        <p>Décidément l'Administration Municipale se moque des contribuables ; non
                            seulement elle a rendu impossible la promenade près de la mer, mais
                            encore toute promenade en ville. La poussière des terrassements couvre
                            Alexandrie d'un manteau, qui, avec le degré d'humidité dont nous
                            souffrons actuellement, forme une espèce de colle. L'administration,
                            fidèle à ses principes, fait la sourde oreille à toutes les
                            réclamations, mais elle n'oublie pas de percevoir le 2 %<hi
                                rend="italic">manu-militari</hi>. Il ne nous reste donc plus qu'à
                            faire un appel aux pompiers qui ont donné plusieurs fois des preaves de
                            leur zèle. Ils peuvent aisément avec une pompe arroser en quelques jours
                            toute cette surface avec de l'eau de mer.</p>

                        <p>Si les Alexandrins au plus fort de la canicule sont privés de bains,
                            exposés à des rafales de poussière, empoisonnés par les bouches d'égout,
                            ils peuvent du moins se féliciter de nourrir à leurs frais d'heureux
                            fonctionnaires et de leur payer des congés annuels de trois mois et demi
                            pour se reposer de travaux qu'ils n'ont point faits et échapper pendant
                            les mois les plus pénibles à l'abominable situation qu'ils ont créée à
                            Alexandrie. Dernièrement encore un simple farache était proposé par la
                            Délégation pour des vacances officielles ! Il est à souhaiter dans de
                            telles conditions que la Municipalité arrive à un tel développement des
                            emplois municipaux qu'il y ait place pour toute la population. On
                            habitera l'hiver des villas à Ramleh et on ira passer l'été en Europe.
                            La ville vulgaire sera abandonnée aux étrangers avec tous ses
                            accessoires, le quai, le tout l'égout, les plages de Kaït Bey et de

                    <p>La Délégation autorise la Compagnie de Ramleh à installer un kiosque au

                        d'une année, moyennant paiement des droits règlementaires.</p>
                    <p>Communication est donnée d'une lettre du 4 Juillet du Ministère de
                        l'Intérieur informant que le Gouvernement regrette qu'il n'y ait pas
                        possibilité de déferer au désir de la Municipalité au sujet du débarquement
                        des bovidés provenant de Russie et de la Macédoine, à Chatby, pour y purger
                        la quarantaine, vu qu'il n'y a pas d'autre emplacement disponible pour
                        servir au débarquement des bovidés susvisés.</p>
                    <p>Le Ministère remet copie d'un règlement contenant certaines dispositions
                        relatives au transport des animaux en question.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation tout en émettant un avis favorable aux dispositions prises en
                        vue d'un meilleur traitement des bêtes, espère que la mesure ne sera que
                        provisoire, vu les grandes objections soulevées par elle au choix de
                        l'emplacement précité.</p>
                    <p>Interpellé au sujet d'une question touchant l'application de l'art. 4 de la
                        loi organique municipale relativement à la confection des listes
                        électorales, le Gouvernement est d'avis qu'il y a lieu de continuer à faire
                        figurer dans les listes 1. les occupants de bureaux, magasins, chounahs,
                        aussi bien que les occupants de maisoin d'habitation 2. de cumuler, pour
                        l'établissement du cens électoral la valeur locative de la maison
                        d'habitation et des bureaux ou magasins, ou des différents magasins occupés
                        par la même personne et dûment inscrits en son nom.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation renvoie cet avis au comité de révision, qui l'avait
                        provoqué.</p>
                    <p>Communication est donnée d'une lettre du 7 juillet du Département des Travaux

                    <p>La Délégation émet un avis favorable à ces mesures et charge les services
                        techniques de lui soumettre le devis des frais qu'elles nécessiteront.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation adjuge à M. Pizzolante Francesco di Luigi et Hag Saad Sabla, au
                        prix de L. E. 458 et 1/2 les travaux de dallage, à Manayer, des rues El
                        Koubri el Gadim et Masguid el Hag Nazir ainsi que le dallage et la
                        canalisation de la rue Sahet Bakir.</p>
                    <p>Elle adjuge aux memes entrepreneurs au prix de L.E. 49 1/2 les travaux de
                        canalisation pour l'écoulement des eaux pluviales ainsi que des eaux vannes
                        de divers immeubles, sis rue Abdel Moneïm.</p>
                    <p>La Délégation n'a pas d'objection à une demande présentée par la British
                        Manufacturers Exhibition of Egypt pour l'occupation provisoire du jardin

                        fasse droit à cette demande.</p>

                        particulièrement ressenti des nouvelles, car le juillet pour sa part a
                        montré bonne tenue.</p>

                    <head>OUR PARIS LETTER</head>
                    <dateline>Paris, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>Paris is at present full of motor cars and their owners. It is always more or
                        less bo, and every day there seem to be more motor cars than ever. Bat at
                        the present moment those who are in Paris with their motor cars are only "en
                        passant." They are on their way from every corner of France—one might say
                        from every corner of the earth—to Auvergne, where the international contest
                        known as the Gordon Bennett Cup Race is about to be run. This will be the
                        sixth time that the automobile clubs of Europe and America have met to do
                        battle for the possession of the great international trophy, and owing to
                        the decision of the Automobile Club of France to take part in no more of
                        these contests it will probably be the last to be run under the conditions
                        which have governed its predecessors. Since the Cup was founded it has been
                        won three times by a Frenchman, once by an Englishman and once by a German.
                        The probability is that on Wednesday France will be once more victorious,
                        but it is never safe to prophesy. When the start is given at six o'clock in
                        the morning the first man to leave will be Théry, a Frenchman, the winner of
                        last year's contest. He will be followed by Clifford Earp, an Englishman,
                        and the third man to rush after them will be Jenatzy, the well-known German
                        racer. There will be eighteen racers in all, three of whom are Englishmen.
                        The cars of the different countries are easy to recognise if you know their
                        colours, which will be : England, green; France, blue ; Germany, white,
                        Italy, black ; Austria, black and yellow ; America, red.</p>
                    <p>The French Northern Squadron has arrived in Brest Roadstead, and is now
                        getting ready to receive the English bluejackets. During the stay of the
                        British Fleet the warships of the two nationalities are to be so arranged
                        that each British vessel will have a French man-of-war at her stern and
                        another at her bows, and vice versa. The combined fleets will include
                        twenty- eight ships of war, which will be placed in five parallel lines
                        facing east and west. The British and French flagships will be at the head
                        of the two lines, nearest to the shore. The French and British battleships
                        will be moored within the sheltered harbour, while the cruisers will be
                        several miles out in the open harbour.</p>
                    <p>The "Echo de Paris" published a remarkable article a few days ago on the
                        relations of, France, England, and Germany from the pen of M. Delafosse, a
                        well-known and highly respected member of the Conservative Opposition. M.
                        Delafosse, adhering to the view he expressed ip the Chamber two months ago,
                        regards Morocco as a pretext, the real aim of German policy being the
                        destruction of the rapprochement between France and England. Differing,
                        therefore, from the German publicists, Who allow France no alternative but
                        an alliance with Germany, he holds that a defensive alliance with England
                        would be of value to her both in war and in peace. In the eventof war,
                        England could not only destroy the German Fleet, but paralyse Germany's
                        industrial and commercial activity by blockade and compel surrender by the
                        menace of famine. "Germany would be compelled in a few weeks to ask for
                        mercy, and it would be France, even if herself defeated, who on joint
                        account with victorious England would dictate peace." It was precisely
                        because the chances were such in the event of war, continued M. Delafosse,
                        that Germany would not run the risk, and this was why an alliance with Great
                        Britain was for France the beat safeguard of peace. In conclusion, he
                        repudiates the insinuation Chat England has been trying to "use" France,
                        contending that what enables France to count on England is England's own
                        interest,—viz., to prevent the annihilation of France, the necessary
                        counterpoise to the power of Germany, and the "obligatory antagonist" of the
                        monstrous expansion of the Germany of Pan-Germanism.</p>
                    <p>An amusing incident happened a few days ago in a fashionable restaurant in
                        the Bois de Boulogne. The staff of the German Embassy were dining together
                        at this establishment and not long after they had sat down the seats at the
                        adjoining table were taken by well-known members of the Ministry of Foreign
                        Affairs at the Quai d'Orsay. Polite salutations were exchanged, and the meal
                        was proceeding to the satisfaction of both parties when the Germans suddenly
                        discovered that their neighbours had as their guest of honor M. Delcassé, to
                        whom they were offering a farewell dinner. That was more than the Germans
                        had bargained for, and during the remainder of the meal a visible restraint
                        sat upon their party, and made them wish that they had chosen another
                        restaurant.</p>
                    <p>Five hundred armed men belonging to a foreign fleet will descend upon Paris
                        on July 6, at seven o'clock in the morning. Their nationality is American,
                        and they come to search i not for booty, but for a coffin. In that coffin
                        are the remains of Paul Jones, Father of the American Navy. Though born in
                        Scotland, Paul fought against the English both for ! France and America.
                        Dumas took him for his type of Capitaine Paul, and Fenimore Cooper related
                        his exploits in the "Pilot." He was buried in France, poor and neglected.
                        To-day he has risen to glory, and will be escorted back to the country of
                        his adoption by an American Naval division. For long his body lay
                        undiscovered, though it was known that the soil of the old Protestant
                        cemetery had given it shelter. General Porter proved a most indefatigable
                        searcher, and success has rewarded his efforts. So Paul, dead these hundred
                        years, crosses the ocean in great state, and his<cb n="2"/> ashes will be
                        reinterred under the flag he served with such distinction.</p>
                    <p>The air is full of examinations. It is one of those unhappy educational
                        traditions that the dog days should be given to the torture of youth. Upon
                        success or failure, doubtless, depends the enjoyment of the holiday that
                        supervenes. Education is a serious matter under Republican skies. There are
                        diminutive maidens of eleven or twelve who are asked in their examination
                        paper, What is meant by politics ? A certain little lady said ; "Monsieur
                        Loubet and his Ministers," which was not so had. One might have expected
                        some allusion to papa's temper, or the increase in the family fortune if the
                        right man got in. Another part of the examination was dictation, and the
                        subject chosen was universal suffrage. Evidently the young daughters of the
                        State are not to be allowed to ignore the blessings of this prime democratic
                        doctrine. Let us hope that, when digging in the sand at Trouville, they will
                        not be too seriously troubled about Morocco, or have to stay their play to
                        inquire of a little comrade: "Dis, Juliette, crois-tu que le Radical va
                        passer dans ton arrondissement "?</p>
                    <p>A new bâtonnier rules over the Paris Bar. That is the great event at the
                        Palais de Justice. The lot of the black robe has fallen upon Maitre Chenu, a
                        most popular advocate. In style and appearance he is the military officer.
                        His hair is brushed "en brosse" and his moustache has a fiery and a
                        truculent air. He has been concerned in all the great cases. He was counsel
                        for the "eternal fiancée," poor Maria Daurignac, whose unwillingness to
                        marry the unexisting Crawford was one of the beauties of the Humbert story.
                        Recently, Maître Chenu has pleaded in the "tutu" case, in which a "première
                        danseuse" insisted on her right to appear in the traditional ballet skirt
                        instead of a costume belonging to the period of the play. Curiously, the
                        courts supported the artiste. Some political "causes célèbres" have given
                        scope for the new bâtonnier's power of oratory and play of sarcasm. He has
                        defended the Congregations when charged with illegality, and Captain
                        François, in the Affaire Dautriche, when accused of malversation of secret
                        service funds. A strong man with a kind heart and a stickler for traditions
                        is the new President of the Paris lawyers. To this day is remembered his
                        horror at seeing a barrister arrive in cyclist breeches in the sacred
                        precints of the court, and on another occasion his anger blazed out at a
                        colleague who smoked a pipe in the corridors.</p>
                    <p>One had almost forgotten that disastrous contest, the Algiers-Toulon race, of
                        two months ago, when, with two exceptions, all the motor- boats engaged in
                        it were sunk in the storm of May 17 on the voyage between Port Mahon and
                        Toulon. The exceptions were the Fiat X., which was lifted on board one of
                        the escorting war vessels, and the Quand Même, which was washed ashore on
                        the coast of Corsica.</p>
                    <p>It is with surprise, therefore, that one hears of a long list of prizes being
                        awarded to the competitors. The committee responsible for the conduct of the
                        race met on Sunday, and as their first business heard a protest by Mme du
                        Gast against the Fiat X. The latter vessel, it may be remembered, won the
                        first part of the race, and is still above water. Mme du Gast's boat, the
                        Camille, for which she claimed first prize, is beneath the waves. She wished
                        the Fiat X. to be disqualified, on the ground that it carried four persons
                        instead of five. With characteristic gallantry, the committee ultimately
                        awarded her first prize for her non existent boat, but, in order not to be
                        impolite to the disqualified Italian competitor, they award its owner a
                        number of objets d'art as consolation. Mercedes C. P. receives second prize,
                        Mercedes-Mercedes third prize, Quand Même fourth prize, Heracles II, fifth
                        prize, and Malgré Tout sixth prize. In fact there were more than enough
                        prizes to go round, and, in addition to the above prizes, there was a
                        liberal distribution of medals, cigarette cases, and other awards.</p>
                    <p>Next year there is to be another big Mediterranean race, but it will be held
                        at a season of the year when the weather is more settled than it is in
                        May.</p>
                    <p>The fair at Neuilly comes to an end this week, and two miles of noise and
                        dissipation disappear in the ordinary quiet of this suburban locality. Of
                        all the fairs which dodge in and out of the capital during the year the only
                        one that enjoys any sort of fashionable vogue is that installed for the past
                        fortnight between the fortifications and the Seine. Friday is its most
                        fashionable moment, when the "chic" world promenades in evening dress. I am
                        bound to say that the ordinary world is not "chic," and seems to be
                        indistinguishable from the normal population of La Villette and
                        Belleville—that is to say, without hats and without those little conventions
                        that belong to ordinary society. On Fridays, then, Tout-Paris is fond of
                        disporting itself on the roundabouts, and the pigs and the sheep and the
                        goats and mackerel have elegant riders round the appointed orbit. There was
                        an unusual spectacle the other evening. A well-dressed crowd stood without
                        one of the booths, and the Parisian actress, Mlle. Polaire, dressed in
                        tights and covered with a mantle, appeared on the platform. It was a special
                        performance of a play by Jean Lorain for the benefit of the day school for
                        the fair children.</p>
                    <p>The visit of the Shah to Contrexéville and his forthcoming stay in Paris
                        reminds a writer in one of the capitals of certain consequences which
                        resulted from the visits paid by the father of the present sovereign to
                        Europe. While he was in Paris during one of his European tours, he was
                        present at a charity<cb n="3"/>sale, where he was struck by the manner in
                        which certain aristocratic and good-looking ladies succeeded in raising to
                        fantastic heights the prices of certain worthless articles. When His Majesty
                        returned to Teheran, he decided to have a charity sale after his own
                        fashion, so sitting down in front of a shop in one of the bazaars he picked
                        up one or two articles and sold them by auction at fabulous prices. But when
                        the sale was over, he kept the lion's share of the proceeds, and handed to
                        the owner of the goods a small part of the sum realised. That was the way in
                        which the Shah understood a charity sale.</p>
                    <p>On another occasion it occurred to the late Shah that it would be a good plan
                        to erect in the streets of his capital little wooden boxes, in which those
                        of his subjects who had anything to complain of might deposit their
                        petitions. He did so, and then went on a visit to Europe. But among his
                        suite was a Minister who saw that certain things were done in a different
                        way abroad. So when they returned to the Shah's dominions, sentinels were
                        placed alongside the petition boxes, and whenever a hapless subject
                        approached with complaint, he receivedsuch a beating from the sentry that he
                        ran for his life, taking his petition with him. Before long no more
                        petitions were received. "How is this ?" asked Nasr-ed-din. "All your
                        Majesty's subjects recognise that you are the most benign of sovereigns, and
                        they are happy to live under your benevolent reign," was the answer of his
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>The Frenchman has a tendency towards the morbid. He likes the recital of
                        horrors, whether the stage or in the feuilleton of the journals. The
                        guillotining of a tramp at Orleans has given rise to an active discussion as
                        to whether life is continued after the separation of the head from the
                        trunk. When the knife had descended, Dr. Beaurieu, a professor of the local
                        faculty, seized the dismembered head and three times addressed it by name.
                        On the first two occasions the eyelids were raised and the eyes fixed
                        themselves on those of the physician. On the third occasion they remained
                        closed.</p>
                    <p>Does a man "survive" his execution ? Does he suffer after having his head out
                        off ? These are the problems debated at this moment in the Press. Some crack
                        the gruesome joke that the victim has "tellement perdu la tête that there is
                        no reliance to be placed on his testimony. However, there is less scepticism
                        amongst the doctors. Life of the tissues does exist after death, says
                        Professor Hartmann, or rather, there is a succession of deaths before the
                        flame is finally extinguished. The opening of the eyelids after the head is
                        cut off is the reflex action on the still vibrant nerves by the sound of the
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>The "petit monde" is in an effervescence ; may be that the "grand monde" is
                        also. It is all because of the great Press lottery. On the walls throughout
                        the town and throughout the country great placards stare out at you offering
                        the gift of a million for a louis. There are, indeed, three winning numbers
                        that entitle to the million (£40,000); likewise four prizes of 500,000
                        francs (£20,000), and other "lots" of 250,000 francs (£10,000), £8,000,
                        £4,000, £2,000, down to £40 and smaller sums. Therehas never been a lottery
                        in France (which are illegal except especially authorised as in this case)
                        where the prizes have been of such importance. No wonder every grisette is
                        dreaming of a castle and a prince. In the ateliers of the dressmakers the
                        workgirls have grouped together to subscribe the necessary twenty francs.
                        The shares are as low as fifty centimes. Even then, if the million should
                        come the way of the syndicate, the result would be a respectable slice for
                        each of the participants. Everywhere in the factories and public offices
                        flourishes this system of partnership, so that every little employé has the
                        firm conviction that some manna from the lottery will fall at his feet.
                        Happily for the peace of mankind the lists close on Monday.</p>

                    <p>Mr. A. T. Waugh, addressing the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said that
                        England's competitors in Turkey were getting on because of the immense
                        trouble they took to obtain trade. The Italians, for instance, by studying
                        the markets and giving credit, have succeeded in getting a large footing. He
                        did not suggest that English manufacturers should send out representatives
                        to sell goods direct, and so do away with the middleman, but he thought they
                        might send experts to see what goods were popular in Turkey and whether they
                        could be made at home at the price. The vice-president of the Chamber
                        remarked that it was astonishing how big the trade between the Manchester
                        district and Turkey was. After India and China Turkey was the largest
                        consumer. Manchester was hardly concerned in exports from Turkey except as
                        they served as a barometer for the trade of the coming season.</p>
                    <p>That the trade between Manchester and Turkey is most important is very true,
                        and this is in a large measure due to the enterprising spirit of the Greek
                        merchants established in Manchester.</p>

                    <p>The successful review of cadet corps on Saturday week and the discussion in
                        connection with it between Lord Meath and others may serve to direct
                        attention to the vital question of military training for the boyhood of the
                        nation. And the Duke of Argyll's article in the current "Nineteenth Century"
                        on "National Defence" is apt in this connection. His conclusion is that
                        until we have the supply of force, that systematic military training of our
                        youth would give us, in reserve "we should not impose disabling conditions
                        on the Volunteer reserves we possess." There he hits the right nail on the
                        head, and we can only hope that the Government will set in earnest about
                        creating this reserve force—meanwhile mending (with guns, transport, and
                        organisation) and not ending the auxiliary forces.</p>

                    <p>A special matinée was given at the St. James's Theatre, London, last Monday
                        week in aid of the funds of the parish of Holy Cross in St. Pancras. The
                        most interesting item in the programme was a new French one-act play
                        entitled "Amosis," of which the scene is the underground vestibule of an
                        Egyptian tomb. A staircase leads down to it from the daylight world and down
                        this comes Eunoe with her slave Winou. Eanoe is a princess who loved Amosis
                        and believes that she was preferred to his wife Ames- Athori. Amosis has
                        told her to bring a phial to his tomb and on pouring its contents into his
                        lips he will awake from his sleep, which is not death. Eanoe gives vent to
                        her passion for him and bids the slave open the door of the tomb. But they
                        are interrupted. Ames-Athori comes down the stair to mourn her lost husband.
                        The two women debate their claims on him and their love. The wife is sure he
                        loved her, for he always came back to her from the mistress to whom he made
                        love only because of her rank. At length the tomb is thrown open and found
                        to be empty. Amosis has gone, but left scroll which tells the two ladies
                        that he cared for neither of them, and has departed in good health to
                        Assyria. They return to the world, the wife to seek another husband, and
                        Eunoe to search for a truer love. The piece hardly made a great impression.
                        Madame Georgette Leblanc-Maeterlinck was a stately and graceful Eunoe, and
                        Miss Dorothy Grimston, who recited her French lines admirably, a striking
                        and charming figure as the Egyptian wife. M. Paul Berton emphasised the
                        quality of the slave as a man of lower caste, of race inferior to those to
                        which the ladies severally belonged.</p>

                    <head>AIDS TO THE COMPLEXION. </head>
                    <p>If every disease had the remedy it deserved, there would be a peculiar
                        fitness in the announcement from Paris that the cure for red noses which has
                        recently been discovered is particularly severe one. The rehabilitating
                        implement is a hammer set with platinum wires, with which the organ is
                        sharply pounded for several minutes a day. Two hammerings week will, after
                        some months, it is said, put post to the objectionable tell-tale habits, and
                        reduce the organ's complexion to a delicate and non-committal pink. Those
                        whose dislike for the bibulous blush is of a more purely æsthetic character,
                        can, of course, remove the eyesore by much less drastic means, for
                        experience shows that a simple continuation of the former treatment will
                        convert the too assertive carmine into a most poetical shade</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
