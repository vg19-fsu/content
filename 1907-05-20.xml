                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN CIVIL SERVICE</head>
                    <p>We publish in another column the details of the new scheme of employment in
                        the Public Works Ministry, whereby provision is made for an eventual and
                        considerable increase in the number of Egyptians employed in that
                        department.</p>
                    <p>It is generally recognized that European assistance, to a certain extent, is
                        necessary to carry on the work of Government in Egypt. Differences of
                        opinion, however, arise when any attempt is made to lay down with any degree
                        of precision the extent to which recourse should be had to European agency.
                        Weighty arguments may be advanced on both sides. On the one hand, says Lord
                        Cromer in his last report, I have had it frequently urged upon me that the
                        efficiency of the service suffers by reasons of the inadequacy of the
                        European staff; that the welfare of the mass of the population must be
                        placed before all other considerations; that the vast majority of voiceless
                        Egyptians prefer good administration to national government; and that,
                        therefore, for the present, and probably for a long time to come, the
                        employment of a large number of Europeans is abolutely necessary. On the
                        other hand, it is stated that the Egyptians prefer a defective system of
                        government administered by their own countrymen to a relatively perfect
                        system administered by aliens; that it is in the highest degree impolitic to
                        push on education and at the same time to close the door of high Government
                        employment to the educated classes; that the Egyptians can never learn to
                        govern themselves unless they are allowed to make the attempt; that any
                        causes which-tend towards maladministration will be temporary and will
                        gradually disappear as a result of the experience which will be gained; and
                        that, therefore, the number of Europeans in the service of the Government
                        should no merely be reduced to the lowest limit should be exceeded, and that
                        even a somewhat high degree of temporary inefficiency should be tolerated in
                        order to attain the desired end.</p>
                    <p>What is quite clear is, that if western civilization is to be introduced into
                        Eygpt, it can only be done by Europeans, or by Egyptians who have imbiled
                        the spirit of civilization, and have acquired the knowleadge necessary in
                        order to apply western methods of governement. The extent to which
                        Europeans, or Egyptians, who have received an European training, should
                        respectively be employed, depends mainly on the supply which is available of
                        the latter class. The main difficulty of dealing with the question is that,
                        for the present, the demand for qualified Egyptians of this class is greatly
                        in excess of the supply.</p>
                    <p>The general policy which has been pursued since the British occupation of the
                        country took place, in 1882, has been to limit the number of Europeans in
                        the employment of the Government as much as possible, to employ Egyptians in
                        the very great majority of the subordinate and in a large number of the
                        superior administrative posts, and gradually to prepare the ground for
                        increasing the number of Egyptians in high employment. This policy is
                        throughly understood by all the leading British officials in Egypt. Some,
                        possibly, have been more successful than others in training their Egyptian
                        subordinates. Some, again, may be inclined to insist on a rather excessive
                        standard of efficiency on the part of the Egyptian before they will readily
                        acquiesce in foregoing the appoitment of an European. As Lord Cromer
                        remarks, "I have never found on the part of any higher British officials in
                        this country any tendency to question the wisdom of the policy, or the least
                        reluctance to give effect to it when once they were convinced that a
                        qualified Egyptian could be found to take any post which might happen to be
                        vacant."</p>
                    <p>The difficulties in the way of giving anything like immediate effect to the
                        substitution on a large scale of Egyptian for European agency in the
                        administrative work of the country are, in fact, very great. This matter is
                        frequently discussed on the assumption that a number of places under
                        Government are now occupied by Europeans for which competent Egyptians could
                        without difficulty be found. This assumption certainly gives a very
                        innocorrect view of the facts of the situation. There is no doubt that there
                        are a few cases as to which it may be said that, if the European occupant of
                        some post vacated his place, a competent Egyptian might at once be found to
                        replace him. But, in the very large majority of cases, the reason why the
                        European holds the post is that the supply of competent Egyptians is not
                        nearly equal to the demand.</p>

                            took place on Saturday evening, and was most enjoyable. The orchestra
                            is, indeed, one of the best which we have heard in Egypt and the Windsor
                            Hotel are to be congratulated on securing the services of such highly

                            known comedy was performed on Saturday evening, and the committee ought
                            to be satisfied with the recption accorded to their production: It is
                            evident that the association achieves far better results in theatricals,
                            than by providing musical entertainments. Of the comedy; known by almost
                            every theatre-goer in the world, there is nothing to be said, except
                            that its 1840 conventionalism seems more than antiquated. Now-a-days,
                            while its perfect and pure style always gives pleasure. Of the artists,
                            we must single out Mr. P. Levy for special notice, his preformance, as
                            Verdelet, was faultless throughout and some of his colleagues might well
                            follow his example more closely ; before they can be really successful,
                            they must learn a less automatic method of delivery, and the art of
                            appearing natural. The elocution of all who took part in the performance
                            was clear and distinct. The committee deserves every kind of
                            encouragement for its efforts, and we would only suggest shorter
                            entrances. </p>

                    <p>London May 13, 1907.</p>
                    <p>The Earl of Cromer arrived in London yesterday on his return home, after
                        laying down the heavy task of administering with conspicuous success and
                        brilliant results the government of Egypt for twenty-four years. Their Royal
                        Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Counnught, together with a
                        distinguished company, were present on the platform at Victoria Station to
                        receive him when he arrived, by the special train at twenty minutes to four. </p>
                    <p>It has been said that "Peace hath her victories, not less reknowned than
                        war." There is no parallel in history for the regeneration which Lord Cromer
                        effected in the affairs of Egypt. He raised an entire population from a
                        condition of object misery, which was but little removed from slavery, to
                        one of comfort and security ; he raised a nation from bankruptcy to
                        affluence, purified the administration of Justice, and organised successful
                        wars, which restored the territories of which that nation had been deprived
                        by revolution, and established a reputation as a statesmalike administrator
                        which is unrivalled. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer travelled by special train from Dover. On the platform, outside
                        the barriers within which the privileged spectators had gathered, a small
                        crowd had assembled, and as soon as the train came to a standstill, an
                        erect, white-haired figure with spectacled eyes stepped out on the platform,
                        alert and active, to be greeted by a cheer of welcome. Immediately the
                        Prince of Wales and the Duke of Connaught stepped forward, bareheaded, and
                        shook hands warmly with Lord Cromer, and their Royal Highnesses' example was
                        followed by the members of the group which surrounded the central figure. In
                        the midst of the hand­shakings Lord Cromer's youngest son, a sturdy little
                        lad of four years, dressed in a blue sailor suit, with fair curling locks
                        straying out from beneath his cap, ran forward and grasped his fathers
                        hands, a glad smile of welcome on his beaming face. Lord Cromer stooped and
                        kissed the child, with his hands laid affectionately on his shoulder. Then
                        he turned again to the friends about him and received their greetings. </p>
                    <p>The Earl of Cromer, who was accompanied by the Countess of Cromer, remained
                        on the platform a few minutes, chatting. He then look leave of the Prince of
                        Wales and the Duke of Connnaught, and, accompanied by the Lord Chamberlain,
                        entered a pair-horsed closed carriage from the Royal stables and drove to
                        Buckingham Palace, where he had the honour of a long interview with the
                        King. Lord Cromer as he drove away, was cheered by the small crowd which had
                        gathered outside the station. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and
                        the Duke Connaught were also cheered as they left the station. ("Daily

                    <p>Sir Benjamin Baker may justly betermed one of the greatest British civil
                        engineers of the time. He was joint engineer with Sir John Fowler of the
                        Forth Bridge and consulting engineer to the Egyptian Government for the Nile
                        Dam. Sir Benjamin was born in 1840 and was made a K.C.M.G. in 1890 and a
                        K.C.B. in 1902. He was also an L.L.D., D.S.C., and F.R.S., and had the
                        Medjidieh of the 1st class. He was a frequent visitor to Egypt and his note
                        on the raising of the Assouan Dam was printed in the recent White Book on
                        that subject. He was the inventor of the pneumatic. </p>

                    <p>This property of the French Government in the Mohamed Aly Square at
                        Alexandria, which was recently exchanged and now belongs to the Alexandria
                        Municipality, is soon to be transformed. The old site of the French
                        Consulate, locally known as the "French Garden" and the buildings to the
                        north will shortly be made into a square. The tenders for the demolitions of
                        the buildings, and the existing square, were considered to be quite
                        inadequate by the Municipal Delegation, and consequently the work is to be
                        undertaken by the Municipality. The old buildings, which a few years ago

                    <p>The "Army and Navy Gazette," in announcing Major Gamble's appointment to
                        succeed Col. McCracken in command of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, remarks:- </p>
                    <p>If we may judge by the accounts of the battalion which reached us from Egypt
                        during its tour of duty there, the new C.O. is heartily to be congratulated
                        on succeeding to his "birthright" at a time when the character of the 2nd'
                        Royal Berkshire stands so very high, for the vety best reports were sent
                        home as to its condition. In one respect the new C.0. is less fortunate,
                        than his predecessor, Col. McCracken was promoted, to his
                        lieutenant-colonelcy at the age of 43 ; Lieut.-Col. Gamble has attained his
                        47th year. He starts under favourable auspices, however, and he is the
                        possessor of a Stall College certificate. </p>

                    <p>SABA PACHA'S REPORT</p>
                    <p>The report of the Postmaster-General to the Minister of Finance on the work
                        of the Administration during 1906 years that considerable progress has been
                        made in every branch of the service.</p>
                    <p>The total correspondence for 1906 handled by the Post Office was 58,000,000
                        against 50,770,000 in 1905—an unprecedented increase of 14%. The increase in
                        the number ot registered articles in the inland service is especially
                        remarkable, being 70% over 1905 ; this increase may be set down to the
                        reduction of the registration fee from 10 to 5 millièmes.</p>
                    <p>18,340,000 letters, 1,185,000 postcards, 1,310,000 registered objects,
                        12,940,000 newspapers and printed matter, and 2,900,000 free Governmental
                        correspondence (all inland service) passed through the post office.
                        4,510,000 letters were dispached abroad against 4,685,000 received from
                        abroad, and against the 6,420,000 newspapers and printed matter received
                        from abroad 2,540,000 were dispatched. </p>
                    <p>In the foreign service Great Britain (including Malta and Gibraltar) claims
                        out of the total correspondence 26.4%, France exchanged 17.1%, Turkey 10%,
                        Italy 9.9%, Germany 7.9%, and Austro-Hungrv 6.9%. Since the introduction of
                        the penny postage the correspondence exchanged between Egypt and the United
                        Kingdom and British colonies has increased by 60%.</p>
                    <p>Taking the quinquennial periods of the last twenty years, the correspondence
                        handled was in 1886, 12,695,000 ; 1891, 17,l16,000 ; 1896, 24,110,000 ;
                        1901, 33,720,000; 1906, 58,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The proportion of undelivered correspondence remains the same, namely 6.6 per
                        1,000, but this includes a large number of unaddressed envelopes. </p>
                    <p>L.E. 23,358,000 were transmitted through, the inland post, of which L.E.
                        3,295,000 were in postal money orders, L.E. 12,950,000 groups, and the
                        remainder Government orders. The corresponding figures in 1905 were L.E.
                        22.880,000 ; in 1901 L.E. 17,400,000 ; in 1896 L.E. 15,900,000 ; in 1891
                        L.E. 13,353,000 ; in 1886 L.E. 10,653,000. L.E. 719,400 in money orders were
                        received from abroad, and L.E. 77,500 sent abroad in money orders.</p>
                    <p>The exchange of "postal orders" with the United Kingdom and its colonies,
                        which service was inaugurated in April 1905, has develveloped remarkably.
                        From April 1 to December 31, 1905, 3,854 postal orders were issued for a sum
                        of L.E. 3,514 and 2,416 to the value of L.E. 1,864 were paid. In 1906, the
                        number of pistol orders issued was 19,520 for a sum of L.E. 11,840, and
                        those paid were 6,300 for a sum of L.E. 2,754. It is also remarked that the
                        issuing of postal orders has not effected the money orders, which, as
                        already shown, were considerably increased.</p>
                    <p>850,000 parcels passed through the post in 1906, as compared with 751,000 in
                        1905—an increase of 14 %, and of the former number 478,000 were to or from
                        foreign countries. Germany and Egypt exchanged 117,130 parcels, France
                        l00,480, Great Britain and colonies 74,610, Italy 50,670, and Austro-Hungary
                        66,140. Judging from the customs dues paid the value of parcels imported was
                        about L.E. 765,000.</p>
                    <p>During 1906 the postal service was extended to 168 new localities, the number
                        of offices and postal stations being raised to 1,249. </p>

                    <p>As its last sitting the Council of Ministers approved an interesting note
                        from Sir William Garstin relative to the advancement of native engineers in
                        the Public Works service. This note, drawn up after long consultation
                        between Sir William Garstin, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Perry, states that every
                        possible advantage will be given to native engineers from the Polytechnic
                        School at Cairo, and a period of trial will be fixed for each native
                        engineer, which will be passed in Europe. Each year, two or three engineers
                        of each department of Public Works will be chosen for this by their chiefs.
                        In the service of mechanical-engineers, Europeans will still be appointed. </p>
                    <p>The irrigation posts attributed to native engineers will be (1) inspectors of
                        irrigation with annual salaries of from L.E. 800 to L.E. 1,200 ; (2)
                        directors of works from L.E. 400 to L.E. 700 ; (3) sub-directors of works
                        from L.E. 240 to L.E. 360 ; (4) chief engineers, engineers, and assistant
                        engineers jn the provinces.</p>
                    <p>The proportion of the technical staff will be as follows: (l) inspectors of
                        the ten circles of irrigation (the projects circle, will be suppressed on
                        the completion of its work) 6 Europeans and 4 natives: (2)directors of
                        works, 8 Europeans and 6 natives: (3) sub-directors of works, 12 Europeans
                        and 10 natives ; (4) chief engineers drawing from L.E. 360 to L.E. 600 per
                        year, 30, all natives, (5) assistant engineers drawing from L.E. 114 to L.E.
                        300 per year, 157, all natives.</p>
                    <p>The Irrigation Service will therefore include 36 Europeans drawing from L.E.
                        240 to L.E. 1,200, and 207 natives drawing from L.E. 144 to L.E. 1,200.</p>
                    <p>The native staff will not be complete for two years. From the present Sir
                        William Garstin proposes to send two or three pupils every year to study in
                        Europe. This new system will entail an addition of L.E. 2,620 to the budget
                        of the Irrigation Service.</p>
                    <p>Similar arrangements have been made in the Towns and Buildings Service which
                        will necessite increased expenses amounting to L.E. 4,594 and an increased
                        budget of L.E. 2,680. </p>

                    <head>THE LATE SYDNEY CARVER<lb/>BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS</head>
                    <p>Born in 1851, Mr. Sydney Henton Carver has passed away at the early age of
                        56, mourned and regretted not only by the British community, but also by
                        people of every nationality in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Carver arrived in Egypt in 1872, and, after spending some years at
                        Mansourah, he became a partner in the firm of Messers. Carver and Co. and
                        removed to Alexandria in 1881.</p>
                    <p>His kindness of heart, his desire to be of use to his fellow men, and his
                        determination to do what was right soon, made his influence felt, and it may
                        truly be said that there has been no charitable or public movement of any
                        importance in Alexandria during the last twenty-five years in which Mr.
                        Sydney Carver has not taken a leading part.</p>
                    <p>It would be difficult to enumerate all his public services to the town in
                        which he lived. But we may remind our readers that Mr. Carver was largely
                        instrumental in obtaining relief for Mansourah in 1883, when, in consequence
                        of the severe outbreak of cholera and the cordon round the town, the
                        supplies of medicine and food became exhausted; that it was due to Mr.
                        Carver's initiative that the Rudolph home for the poor was placed on a sound
                        and business-like basis; that Mr. Sydney Carver was the guiding spirit of
                        the Victoria House and Nurses' Home which is now so successful, that, mainly
                        through his influence, an extra wing is being added to the building ; that
                        he was the first vice-president of the Municipality; and, finally, that he
                        was always chosen as one of the British representatives on any International
                        Committee.</p>
                    <p>But apart from these public services there were others of a more private
                        nature that Mr. Carver rendered to those around him and which endeared him
                        to all who came in contact with him. In times of trouble and of grief Mr.
                        Carver's help was always sought and never refused. He was the first to act,
                        the first to aid; and to many the news of his death will bring back
                        remembrances of some particular occasion when, by his sympathetic nature and
                        sound common sense, he was able to assist of console then at difficult times
                        of their life.</p>
                    <p>As one of the managing directors of the firm of Messrs. Carver Bros and Co.
                        Ltd., Mr. Sydney Carver held for many years an important position in the
                        business circles of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>In 1900, at great personal sacrifice and purely from a strict sense of duty,
                        Mr. Sydney Carver consented to act as one of the three liquidators of the
                        Banque Industrielle. Probably only those who followed the intricate
                        operations which that liquidation involved could appreciate the labour,
                        patience, and business capacity which were required to bring the matter to a
                        successful termination.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Carver was chairman of the British Chandler of Commerce, and
                        Vice-President of the cotton section of the Produce Association and chairman
                        or member of every committee connected with the exports trade of Egypt,
                        besides being a director of several public companies.</p>
                    <p>By none will Mr. Sydney Carver's death be more regretted than by the staff of
                        Messrs. Carver Bros. and Co. Ltd., who looked upon him not only as the head
                        of the firm in Egypt, but also as one who had their personal interests at
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>We beg to tender our sincere sympathy to Mrs. Carver and the family, who are
                        passing the summer at Winsley House, Bradford on Avon, which Mr. Sydney
                        Carver purchased only a few months ago.</p>
                    <p>No further details as to the cause of death have as yet reached
                        Alexandria.</p>

                        What is the cause of this general depression? The writer of the article
                        attributes it to the large number of new flotations that have taken place
                        during the past six months and to the wild speculation that was indulged in
                        on the Bourses of Cairo and Alexandria. That in a measure is correct ; but
                        only in a measure. The real reason is that all confidence has been
                        completely shattered for the time being. Egypt today is more prosperous than
                        it ever was before. If speculators have last money it does not mean that
                        that money has been lost to Egypt ; what Tom loses Harry makes ; large
                        "paper profits" were made and large "paper profits" were lost, but the
                        prosperity of the country has steadily increased ; the cotton crop of last
                        year is turning out the biggest on record and is selling at record prices.
                        The country is full of money, the imports of gold coin into the country
                        reached a phenomenal figure last year, and hardly any of it has since found
                        its way back to Europe. Why then this panicky feeling in the financial
                        atmosphere of Egypt? The answer is simple enough. In reading the article of
                        the Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce one finds the following
                        statement : "The Egyptian Banks did their best to moderate the gambling
                        fever by refusing to increase their advances, on local shares, whilst
                        several of them went further amd confined their advances to the better class
                        of securities entirely eliminating those of a financial or land speculating
                        character." If that were all that the Egyptian banks did, no fault could be
                        found with their action. It would be only a question of common banking
                        prudence ; but they went further. Some of our leading banking magnates put
                        their heads together and said all this speculation must be stopped. A
                        regular and organised campaign was started by them to curtail speculation,
                        and the result has been a complete shattering of all confidence in Egyptian
                        securities. These same banking magnets-now sit gloomily in their offices and
                        metaphorically wring their hands and say "what will be the end of all this?"
                        They have raised the ghost and have no idea how to lay it now that it has
                        served their purpose : and yet the re-establishment of confidence is easy
                        enough. Let these same banking magnates put their heads together once more.
                        Let them make a list of really first class securities, securities which are
                        paying regular dividends and are what we might call the "gilt edge"
                        securities of Egypt, such as National Bank, Agricultural Bank, Credit
                        Foncier, Delta Light Railways, Dairas etc. etc. Let them fix the value of
                        these shares on 4 per cent and 5 percent bases and then form a pool amongst
                        themselves and commence buying these shares, continuing to buy all that are
                        procurable until they rise to the values they have fixed upon. They will not
                        have to buy very many shares before confidence is once more established, and
                        perhaps the argument that will appeal all the more to them is that they will
                        secure substantial profits to their various Links for they can commence
                        buying these first class securities at very low figures indeed. Establish
                        confidence once more and the public will do the rest, for their is no lack
                        of money in the country. </p>

                        death of Mr. Carver, formerly vice-president of the Municipality, and the
                        meeting was suspended for a few minutes.</p>
                    <p>On the resumption of the meeting the Delegation considered the offer of the
                        Fire Protection Company for the installation of fire alarms at Minet el
                        Bassal, and after heaving read the report of the public works committee on
                        the matter, they decided not to give authorisation to the said company
                        unless it should undertake to lay its connections underground.</p>
                    <p>A letter from the Windsor Hotel, renouncing the purchase of the street
                        separating the plots of land belonging to the Company on the new quay, was
                        read. A plan of regulations and tariff for boats on the Mahmoudieh Canal was
                        adopted and sent forward to the Commission for approval. A letter from the
                        Ministry accepting their proposals concerning the building of bridges was
                        read. The Government undertakes the enlargement of Ibrahim bridge over the
                        Mahmoudieh Canal and the Municipality is to build two new bridges. </p>

                        City office of the "Tribune." Mr. Woolacott is best known, perhaps, outside
                        the ranks of financial journalism, for he has been responsible for more than
                        one big journalistic coup that has set the world talking. It was he who
                        interviewed Marchand on his way from Fashoda, and who gave to the world the
                        memorable interview with Dreyfus after the Rennes trial. His many friends,
                        journalistic and otherwise, will wish him well in his new endeavours, and
                        will congratulate the "Tribune" on its acquisition. </p>

                        £90,000 divided in 89,700 ordinary shares of one pound sterling each, and

                    <head>THE ABOUKIR CO.'S OPERATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The annual general meeting of the Aboukir Company was held in London last
                        week, Mr. Gerald A. Sheppard presiding. The chairman, in moving the adoption
                        of the report, said that During the whole period of Aboukir reclamation
                        there had never been such a marked advance in the condition of the land os
                        during the post year. This was due to the new syphon, which, aiding the
                        others, had given continuous drainage to all the land. Whilst the yield of
                        cotton was not equal to the promising appearance of the crop, the price was
                        extremely good at £4 per cantar—the best the company had ever obtained.
                        Purchasers of land and tenants were alike satisfied. The company new held
                        about 10,700 feddans of their original 30,000, and the policy of the
                        directors was to raise a rent-roll from which to pay a steady dividend
                        rather than to diminish by further sales the area now held. During the
                        present year it was proposed to canalise about 4,000 feddans of new land,
                        and they would complete the canalisation of all the Aboukir lauds. The
                        prospects of the country were very satisfactory, and if the great work
                        initiated by Lord Cromer was continued by his successor, with good crops,
                        all would be well. The report was adopted. </p>

                        <p>Sir,—Referring to what I have already written under the above heading,
                            and which you have had the courtesy to publish, anent the communications
                            between the streets and the drains ; I have been informed that our
                            Municipality have discontinued availing themselves of the approved "
                            Plesch " siphon for the reason, that they have in view another and
                            better system. I don't know Sir, what this "better'' system may be, but
                            one thing is certain, and that is that such new system is conspicuous by
                            its absence and that in default of the one siphon that has been
                            successfully employed, and during the time the " better " system is
                            being prepared, the sewer-gas is continually escaping at many frequented
                            points into the streets, which could be promptly preverted by the use of
                            the existing " Plesch " siphons. I would add that I am not interested in
                            this system otherwise than as a citizen, who deems it his duty to call
                            public attention to a grave source of disease, and its remedy. I am,

                                disappointed with the results of the Conference, but is confident
                                that in future the attitude of the Imperial Government will be less
                                unbending. The Conference, he says, aroused public feeling with
                                regard to matters of vital importance. </p>
                            <p>Mr. Deakin is sailing on Monday. He says that while the actual

                    <head>PORT SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE.</p>
                    <p>MR. HOLDER'S REPORT.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty of procuring labour creates a demand for labour saving
                        machinery of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>The amount of Government building which has already been done at Port Sudan
                        is surprising, and I venture to say that the progress which has been made
                        reflects the highest credit on the Sudan Department of Public Works, and
                        especially on its local representative, Captain Kelly, R.E. The work is
                        still being carried on in every direction, and a firm of building
                        contractors of good standing would certainly be able to secure a number of
                        contracts already. Much more will be practicable in this line as soon as the
                        building of the town itself is rendered feasible by a settlement of the land
                        tenure.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Government contracts, I may mention one scheme which is
                        already under consideration, that is, the construction of a water reservoir
                        in the hill, and of a conduit to the town, some 25 miles off.</p>
                    <p>A small cold storage is already being constructed by a private firm, which
                        should he of the greatest advantage, both to the public and to the firm. I
                        think this might well he expanded much more widely. At present the steamers
                        from Suez take about 3 1/4 days to reach Port, Sudan ; they run irregularly,
                        and are not well found. Modern steamers could easily do the journey
                        regularly in 48 hours. If they were fitted with a cold storage room, and if
                        a cold storage wagon were placed on the railway, they could provide Port
                        Sudan, Atbara (including Berber), Khartoum, and possibly also Merowe
                        (Kereima) with fresh provisions, fruit, etc. Such a line of steamers should
                        be able to cut out the old Nile route altogether as a means of communication
                        with Khartoum, for the direct trains already run in 22 hours only from Port
                        Sudan to the capital.</p>
                    <p>It is true they would at present have one difficulty to encounter, and that
                        is the antiquated system of quarantine still enforced in the Sudan. In the
                        event of a case of plague at Suez, five days' quarantine from the date of
                        leaving that port are imposed but I understand that it is proposed to alter
                        this for surveillance of passengers and disinfection of cargo.</p>
                    <p>For those who are entirely unacquainted with the region I should perhaps add
                        that public security is as great as in any European country—if not greater.
                        The sanitary condition of the town is good. Justice is administered
                        impartially and capably.</p>
                    <p>The British Vice-Consul, Mr. Echlin, is perfectly acquainted with the local
                        conditions and able to answer any specific questions that might be addressed
                        to him, though his duties as an official of the Sudan Government are heavy
                        and leave him little leisure for other business.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN RULE IN THE AEGEAN.</head>
                    <p>In addition to the manner in which the history of Egypt under the Ptolemies
                        is being illustrated by means of papyri discovered in the country itself new
                        material is continually being provided by the finding of Greek inscriptives
                        in the islands of the Levant. Many of these have been utilised by Struck in
                        his history of the Ptolemies, and by Leclercq in his "Historie des Lagides,"
                        The "Egyptian Gazette" has from time to time mentioned any new text of
                        interest that has been recovered, and we again return to the matter because
                        of an inscription of exceptional historical importance which has been edited
                        by the French explorers of the Island of Delos.</p>
                    <p>In the earlier part of the reign of Ptolemy Energetes we know for certain
                        from the Adulis inscription, in Abyssinia, that Delos and the other Cyclades
                        appertained to Egypt. But certain statement by historians, or in lapidary
                        text, have indicated that the suzerainity did not long endure ; and that
                        soon after the accession of Antigomes Doson in Macedonia, his dominion was
                        set up in the islands in place of that the Egyptian prince. However up to
                        the present definite evidence for this was not forthcoming. The new
                        inscription however decides the question for it proves the existence at
                        Delos of a monument consecrated by Antigonus Doson in memory of the victory
                        of Sellasia.</p>
                    <p>Kileomenes whom Dosen defeated was the ally of Ptolemy Energetes and so it is
                        incredible that had Delos still been Egyptian territory, such a monument
                        could have been erected there. The battle of Sellasia was fought far away in
                        Macedonia and so was not of itself sufficient to eliminate the Egyptian
                        suzerainity in the Cyclade. That was probably the immediate result of the
                        naval victory of Antigonus Doson gained over the Ptolemaic fleet at Andros
                        in 228, or 227 B.C. M. Maurice Holleaux, who edits the new inscriptions
                        gives reasons for thinking that some of the islands remained independent
                        when Egyptian sway was withdrawn Syros and Amorgos we know from other text
                        submitted to Antigonus. This however does not so much concern Egyptian
                        history.</p>

                    <p>DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS</p>
                    <p>"What I endured year after year would have wrecked the strongest
                        constitution." The words were uttered by Mrs. Hatch, of 8 Victoria avenue,
                        Hull, during her recital of a long record of agony resulting from weak,
                        impure blond. Yet after these many years of misery Mrs. Hatch recovered
                        sound health, because in Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People she found
                        a remedy that actually made Rich Red Blood and drove out of her system all
                        the disorders arising from bad blood.</p>
                    <p>"In the first place," said Mrs. Hatch, "I was sickly, pale and anaemic. This
                        was when I was approaching the age of twenty, and as time went on I grew so
                        feeble that often I could hardly keep on my feet. When I rose in the morning
                        fits of dizziness made me stagger helplessly ; I could not touch any
                        breakfast, and all through the day my head and back ached as though a heavy
                        weight was bearing me down. With any exertion I had almost to fight for
                        breath, and how I managed to get upstairs I hardly know. My eyes became
                        sunken, my sight blurred, and my cheeks and lips a deathly white.</p>
                    <p>"All this time I had been taking very little food ; then I could eat nothing
                        without a feeling of deathly sickness coming over me. My stomach became so
                        weak that the lightest diet caused burning, stabbing pains, which shot
                        through me so that I could not stand up straight. During these attacks my
                        heart throbbed as though it would burst. One rainy day I got wet through,
                        and caught a severe cold ; then rheumatic pains flew all over me. If I bent
                        my back a racking, tearing pain shot across it, and my limbs ached so that
                        sleep at night was impossible. Often I fainted away through the acute agony
                        of Rheumatism.</p>
                    <p>"Doctors were consulted, and I even went into hospital ; but, in spite of all
                        treatment, I could get no real relief. I was more like a skeleton than a
                        woman, with no control over my nerves.</p>
                    <p>"It was after I had suffered these afflictions for many years that my sister
                        insisted I should try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and nt last
                        I did. I took several boxes of these pills before I obtained any real relief
                        ; then I was encouraged by signs of improvement I continued with, Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills, and fancied a little food, and could digest it without
                        pains of Indigestion. I enjoyed refreshing sleep at night and as I continued
                        the pills all signs of anaemia vanished, the rheumatic pains left me, and my
                        strength was gradually built up. I felt younger and was in sound health.
                        To-day I am free from all pain, with no fears of illness."</p>
