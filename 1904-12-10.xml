                    <head>ALEXANDRIA AND ALGIERS.</head>
                    <p> While Alexandria is complaining of being entirely unable to cope with the
                        fleets of steamers that flock in ever-increasing numbers to her port,
                        Algiers is grieving over her stagnant trade, and the discussion which has
                        been provoked by the recent report of the Governor-General of Algeria in
                        summing up the findings of the Commission instituted to study the laws which
                        regulate the navigation between France and Algeria, is not without its
                        interest and its lessons for Egypt. It would seem that the many conditions
                        favourable to French navigation have not stimulated the French lines into
                        serving effectively the requirements of France's most important colony.
                        Algeria complains of the tardiness, unpunctuality, and inefficiency of the
                        service. M. Jonnart, the Governor-General, with a liberality of view unusual
                        in a French official-for French officials generally associate themselves
                        unreservedly with the interests of the Metropolis-regrets the onerous
                        conditions which have gone far to shut out foreign competition, to the
                        serious detriment, he thinks, of Algeria, stopping its development and
                        putting a high premium on the cost of living in the colony.</p>
                    <p>The French Journal asks pertinently what would be the result of the
                        abrogation of the special privileges which the French lines carry; ing
                        merchandise and passengers now enjoy. It <cb n="6"/> s tacitly admitted that
                        the result would be disastrous to those companies. On the other hand, the
                        Petit Marseillais declares, in almost panic-stricken tones, that all their
                        Mediterranean rivals would come to Marseilles, and that the consequence
                        would be, among others equally serious, that the transit between France and
                        Algeria would fall into the hands of the Italians, Spaniards, Austrians,
                        &amp;c., "not to speak of the British and Germans, who already frequent in
                        great numbers the Algerian ports." In almost hysterical tones it adds:
                        "Would it not be monstrous that France, which has created a kind of reserve
                        of North Africa, working for three-quarters of a century to that end, should
                        be called on to sacrifice. millions of capital and millions of lives for the
                        advantage of her rivals in the Mediterraneant basin ?"</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Petit Marseillais is thoroughly characteristic of the
                        French theory of colonisation, and it is this attempt to make her
                        possessions in North Africa "a kind of reserve" which has so crippled their
                        develop ment. There is no doubt that the same policy would have been

                        of Alexandria's trade growing by leaps and bounds Egypt's great port would
                        have slowly but surely sunk to the level of a close reserve for French
                        exports. It is hardly necessary to point out that this line of argument in

                        followers, for the English advocates of Fair Trade follow the via media
                        between the extremes of the be mused disciples of Cobdenisn and the vicious
                        protection, which is the ruin of France's com mercial empire.</p>

                    <p>We publish in another column some extracts from an interesting interview
                        published in a Parisian journal on the subject of the future of the French
                        language in Egypt. As the gentleman who has been interviewed on this subject
                        is a well-known French journalist of Alexandria, and is also the director of
                        the leading school of languages here, he has unique opportunities for
                        pronouncing an authoritative opinion. Language, like trade, generally
                        follows the flag, and the French having sold their birthright in Egypt for a
                        mess of Moorish pottage, they have nobody but themselves to blame if their
                        renunciation has given additional impetus to the popularity of the English
                        tongue in the Valley of the Nile. East of Suez English is the predominant
                        language, and its complete conquest of Egypt is only a matter of time,</p>

                        1903. Although a glance at the table of contents does not reveal any new
                        features of importance as regards general information, two very useful pages
                        of astronomical interest are added, and it is interesting to observe that on
                        the 30th of August an eclipse of the sun takes place which, as it will be a
                        total one in a part of Upper , will be an event to be remem- ay bered in the
                        lives of those who witness it, not on only in Cairo and Alexandria, but
                        throughout t's . Two partial eclipses of the moon take place in 1905, both
                        visible at Cairo. The table giving the rising and setting of the planets
                        will be useful to those interested in observing these matters, and if

                        place in the price, which remains at 25 milliemes. Perhaps no other

                        this direction. We know of no similar popular publication in England.</p>

                    <p>Suskin, Dec. 2-The development of Sheikh Barghout is proceeding space. But
                        several busi ness places have lately been opened here in spite of the
                        prospect of the port being transferred from this place to Sheikh Barghout.
                        The merchants still hope against hope that it will never come off, but I can
                        assure your readers that it certainly will. H. M. S. Sealark went to Sheikh
                        Barghout last week for surveying and sounding and the harbour and returned
                        here the day before yesterday. She reports that a great camp has been put up
                        there by the European and native workmen who are engaged in sinking wells.

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,-It is with the utmost reluctance that I address you on the Postal
                        Administration, but it is the only apparent way of effectively remedying the
                        negligence of the authorities in Cairo. On the 4th inst. a letter of great
                        importance was sent to me from Cairo. I received it the next evening. On the
                        5th inst. I posted several letters in the evening; they were of a most
                        pressing nature. Of these, to my own knowledge, one of them was undelivered
                        at 5 o'clock p.m. this evening, and its non-delivery has caused the greatest
                        con- fusion and inconvenience. These letters were all addressed to residents
                        in Cairo. As this has happened many times, I cannot let this occasion pass
                        without protesting most bitterly against the careless way the postal duties
                        are supervised and carried out here.</p>
                    <p>Another grievance is the great delay in the distributions. The authorities,
                        knowing a large mail is in, put up a notice that delivery will be made at
                        "such and such" a time. The delivery is seldom, if ever, made at the time
                        stated. On the 5th inst. delivery was notified for 6 p.m. but it was 6.33
                        before the windows were opened. Result:- loss of time and incon-
                        venience.</p>
                    <p>I hope this will reach the eyes of the responsible official and that more
                        care and punctuality may be the result.</p>
                    <p>1 am, Sir, "LETTERS</p>
                    <p>Cairo, 6th December, 1904. [With regard to the allegations of given above, we
                        may remark that if our cor respondent had sent the envelopes of the letters
                        in question to the Cairo Post Office, the matter could have been brought
                        home to the responsible parties. As to the delay when a large mail arrives,
                        this entirely depends on the numbers of the letters arriving. The Post-
                        master General is very desirous that all irregularities should be made known
                        to him, but it is impossible to trace cases unless the complainants send the
                        envelopes with their complaint. It is obvious that in such a widespread
                        organization and in such a country as Egypt, efficiency is very hard of
                        attainment, but no official in Egypt has a higher ideal of efficiency than
                        our worthy Postmaster General. ED. E.G.).</p>

                        Solomon, outside the Damascus Gate, which form a subterranean cave extending
                        to about half-a-mile under the city. During the meeting several resolutions
                        were enthusiastically and unanimously passed. Telegrams, conveying messages
                        of fraternal and respectful greetings, were dispatched to both his Majesty
                        King Edward VII. and to H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, Grand Master of the

                        received by the Past Master of the late Royal Solomon Mother Lodge, 293,
                        Jerusalem, who attended the meeting at the request of the visitors and
                        delivered a discourse on the interesting site and its relation to

                        as Lothario. As before, the staging was excellent. The chorus was perhaps
                        less agitated in the fire scene than we could have wished, but, as a whole,
                        the performance was as good as any we have heard yet at this theatre, and we
                        seldom have the chance of at hearing a tenor of such qualities and delicate
                        tone as Sig. Tomasino even in Europe,</p>

                    <p>CRICKET.</p>
                    <p>CAIRO. ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                    <p>Play was resumed yesterday at 10.30 am. and Cairo started badly, losing Stout
                        with the score at 74. Capt. Potter continued to bat well, but at 87 he was
                        nicely caught by Dawson low down at third man. Matters seemed to be going
                        badly, but Wild and Graves in a long stand wore down the bowling, Wild's leg
                        hitting being admirable. Numerous changes of bowling were tried, but the
                        batsmen, though both lucky in avoiding being run out, took the over to 165,
                        when Graves was bowled; at lunch-time the score had just passed the
                        Alexandrian total and the Cairo captain declared the innings closed, Wild
                        being not out for a really good innings of 71, which included 12 fours After
                        lunch J. Maclaren and H. B. Carver went in and hit very freely, punishing
                        the Cairo change bowlers with great vigor but taking few risks. In 40
                        minutes they scored 87, when Maclaren was taken in the outfield. The rest of
                        the innings was marked by H. B. Carver's free hitting. He was very severe
                        and Stout's bowling and kept the ball down as a rule, and when the innings
                        was declared was 'not out' for 108. He hit 17 fours and gave no chance. Of
                        the Cairo bowlers Stout had the best figures. Good catches by Stout and
                        Boyes deserve mention. With a balance of 182 against them and the light
                        failing, Cairo did not seem to be out of danger, but after 1 wicket had
                        fallen for 11, Capt. Potter and Lockett wore down the bowling and at the end
                        hit very freely and well. Both were not out o at the close of play, Capt.
                        Potter making 41 and Lockett 56. Both played very good cricket indeed and
                        gave no real chance.</p>
                    <p>The bowling was less effective than in the first innings of Cairo. The wicket
                        keeping on the Alexandria side was very good, both Mur phy and Dawson doing
                        well. For Cairo, Capt. t Potter gave a really first-class display of t
                        keeping to bowling that was at times wanting in accuracy and direction. Only
                        9 byes were scored out of a total of 381 for the two innings The game was a
                        very enjoyable one and the weather on Friday excellent. Full score:

                    <p>II.</p>
                    <p>The collection of antiquities obtained by Mr. Garstang in his excavations at
                        Beni Hasa last season was remarkable for the numerous representatives, as
                        models, and puppets,-all carefully carved in wood and frequently colored-of
                        boats and their crews with masts and helms, and gear, and for models of the
                        sacrifice of oxen. One of the oldest and best preserve l sets of sepulchral
                        furniture in the tomb of Antef had several boats,-sailing vessels and
                        galleys-and à model of a man leading an ox.</p>
                    <p>Another funerary deposit, that of Khety of the XIth, or XIIth, dynasty, had
                        two boats, both with sails, and a carved representation of the sacrifice of
                        an ox. The tomb of one Ma contained a boat with sail, and a canopy, beneath
                        which is a model of the mummy and a crew of 10 persons. Tomb 366 gives a
                        most realistic model of ox sacrifice, the wooden similacrum of the animal
                        being carefully colored to represent a piebald one. There were other
                        specimens in the collection, and such figurative tableaux have been found
                        associated together before.</p>
                    <p>Now, like almost every arrangement by the ancient Egyptians of sepulchral
                        offerings to the dead, this approximation of these two sets of models was
                        carefully intentional, and is to be explained now that we commence to cor-
                        rectly comprehend their ancient ritual literature.</p>
                    <p>M. Lefebiere is one Egyptologist who has understood and explained the
                        symbolic meaning of the juxtaposition of the sacrificial scene and the boat
                        replicas in his essays upon the "Virtue of the Funerary Sacrifice." The
                        concepts are singularly similar to those of other races who had their river
                        of death and Charon the navigator for deceased spirits, but these parallels
                        cannot detain us here. The boat of Isis which put to sea in classic times at
                        the "navigium Isidis" was a copy of the Egyptian cult; not a rival
                        representation of a perhaps equally ancient mythological act.</p>
                    <p>One Egyptian spirit ship was the Osirian Neshemt whose voyage occurred at the
                        commencement of the year as explained by M. Lacau. To return, however, to
                        the old Egyptian literary evidence, the rubric for the "Funerary Sacrifice
                        of the Barque" is known from at least three sarcophagus inscriptions and one
                        papyrus, the last engrossed for a certain Neferubnef of the 18th dynasty.
                        With Egyp tian prolixity it first asks-or rather the priestly magician does
                        for the defunct; that the divine passer, or dragoman-sychopomp, Mahaf by
                        name, shall introduce him to a mysterious ghostly personage (one Aken) wl.o
                        knows how potently and properly to equip the boat. There is only a single
                        secret method, a bull representative of Syphon must as a preliminary be
                        sacrificed, and then parts of his carcase are offered in exchange for the
                        gear, or even used to produce the same. For instance it would appear that
                        the skin of the animal actually formed the sail. But the meaning may have
                        been that the sacrificial offering of the skin would ensure the divinities
                        providing a sail to the spirit's boat in the crossing of the mysterious
                        river,</p>
                    <p>The tomb of Mentuhotep actually possessed two models theatrically
                        representing the complete tableau of the "Funerary barque offer ing."
                        Therein two vessels were placed, one incompletely rigged and furnished,
                        being minus sail or oars. The mummy model was on board stretched on his
                        funerary maritime couch, two weeping women mourners, and four priests; yet
                        no voyage could that unequipped barque ever essay, no elysian shore an
                        unfortunate mummy so situated could ever hope to reach.</p>
                    <p>But there were two other passengers on board this mockery of a vessel, a
                        priest reading a papyrus and a man killing a bull, thus indicating the
                        necessity of the secret sacerdotal wisdom to recite from the magic book the
                        required directions, and formula, to rende the bull sacrifice adequate for
                        the desired purpose of acquiring means for navigation. The second boat model
                        triumphantly showed the result of the proper execution of the sacrifice. It
                        had pars and sails and necessary gear; the deceased, half restored to life
                        already, is seated, clothed in a spotless white robe fit to take his place
                        at the celestial banquet when he reaches the heavenly land, in a little naos
                        protected from the sun during the voyage and the mourners are beside him,
                        dual representatives of Isis and Nepthtys, who so bewailed Osiris dead. Some
                        vessels, as stated, have oarsmen as well as sails. The latter are termed the
                        "wings" of the funerary ship. It must be more than a coincidence that
                        Eschylus says, "Funerary rites urge on the barque of the dead, that the
                        mourners' cries propelled it across Acheron and the clapping of their hands
                        upon their heads was intended to symbolise the sound of the beating of the
                        oars." Modern mourners, too, have mystically spoken of the wings of prayer
                        wafting vows, and even the spirits of the departed, to heaven.</p>
                    <p>It has long become apparent that the most valuable material for forming an
                        adequate digest of Roman law would, when the thous ands of Latin papyri
                        discovered in Egypt are properly edited and studied, be found to be provided
                        by Egyptian papyrus manuscripts. A further proof of this is furnished by the
                        recent recovery of a complete "Latin Deed of Manumission," which is now in
                        the possession of Lord Amherst, and has been published by M. Seymour de
                        Ricci. It is a most important document for all students of Roman law, as
                        well as for historians of Romano-Egyptian civilisation.</p>
                    <p>The deed is not engrossed upon papyrus but upon two wooden tablets and
                        originally came from Hermopolis Magna. The tablets are a little more than 7
                        inches long and somewhat less than 6 inches wide. The text which is in
                        duplicate "diploma." aform, written both on the inside and outside of the
                        tablets and was arranged so as to be tied up <cb n="2"/> and sealed, as set
                        forth in the directions as to legal deeds promulgated in the Senatus
                        Consult, quoted in the "Sententiae" of Julius Paulus. The arrangement of
                        this two-page tablet is approximately similar to that of the numerous
                        "military diplomas" of Roman veterans, that have been recovered. The object
                        of the duplicate inner copy was to prevent any alteration being attempted in
                        the outer text. If the seals were broken so that the cords could be untied,
                        then of course the interior text could be tampered with. But then it ceased
                        to be "evidence" only so long as the seals were intact did it possess legal
                        documentary value.</p>
                    <p>This careful precautionary pre-arrangement for prevention of fraud, like most
                        other things, was not new, but precisely the plan practised by the scribes
                        and judges of Assyria and Babylonia. Their legal and contract tablets were
                        engrossed on a table which was baked; this document then encased in another
                        tablet upon the exterior of which a second copy of the deed was displayed,
                        and this dried and deposit ed for safe custody with the partners to the
                        transaction, who frequently placed the tablets for safe keeping in the
                        archives of some temple where legal decisions were given. In case of
                        litigation, or a desire to ascertain if there were some slight error in the
                        external counterpart of the internal text, judicial permission to break the
                        outer case and peruse the inner engrossment had to be obtained and witnesses
                        provided to see that the whole was accurately re-written and re-coverel for
                        safe storage again. This newly found document consists of three parts: the
                        deed itself, written in cursive Latin, the signatures of the parties therein
                        concerned, and the signatures of the witnesses; the last two written in
                        Greek cursive. The paleographical interest of this relic is very valuable,
                        as it presents us with an important specimen of Latin cursive hand-writing
                        dated A. D. 221. The Greek writing is the usual style of the age of
                        Caracalla.</p>
                    <p>The deed certifies that "Marcus Aurelius Ammonion son of Lupergos has set
                        free his female house-born slave Helene, about 34 years old, and has bidden
                        her to be free, having received for her freedom from Aurelius Ales, from the
                        village of Lisichis, 2200 Augustal drachmas, which Ales has himself made a
                        present of to Helene the above named freed woman;" the date and name of the
                        Emperor are added, it being the 4th year of (*) Marcus Aurelius-Antoninus.
                        The legal phraseology and recapitulation of the conditions and amount paid
                        are considerably more prolix than this summary of the deed.</p>
                    <p>In a luminous commentary upon this document M. de Ricci points out that
                        Ammonian had not long been a Roman citizen, for he gives Greek names for his
                        father and grandfather without any Roman prenomen. It is evident therefore
                        he became a Roman citizen in A.D. 212, when Caracalla presented the
                        citizenship to all inhabitants of the Empire.</p>
                    <p>The text gives Hermopolis the title of "ancient and splendid," which is a
                        precise rendering of an old Greek equivalent in the many papyri relating to
                        the city.</p>
                    <p>Helene is a frequent name for a slave, and the child of every female slave
                        became by legal right the slave of her owner at the time of its birth. The
                        village of Lisichis had been previously found twice upon papyri at Berlin in
                        lists of villages in the Hermopolite nome. The 2200 drachmas, which really
                        were Roman denarii, would amount, approximately, to £400 of modern value.
                        The precise date is certain because the consuls for those A.D. 221, Gaius
                        Vettius Gratus Sabinianus and Marcus Flavius Vitellius Selencus, are given.
                        The rest of M. de Ricci's remarks upon the text are of a legal character and
                        relate more particularly to portions of it not copied here, and are
                        completed by quotations from Latin juridical authors relating to such deeds.
                        The whole may be found in the "Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
                        Archæology" for 1904.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that Ales appears to have presented Helene her
                        freedom from generosity, for a supplementary paragraph to the deed says "I,
                        Aurelios Ales have paid 2200 drachmas and will make no claim on (or against)
                        Helene, the above named freedwoman."</p>
                    <p>The importance of this formal renunciation of any power of future claim is
                        strikingly illustrated by the papyrus No. 106 of the "Oxyrhynchus Papyri,"
                        which is a record of litigation between a certain Demarion, apparently a
                        freedman, and his patron Heraclides. Demarion asserted that Heraclides had
                        accepted asum in complete settlement for all claims. The prefect, who tried
                        the case, however, decided against him and threatened to have him. flogged
                        if he made further claim in the matter. His decision must have been based
                        upon some peculiarity of Alexandrian law, relating to the claims of patrons
                        upon slaves they had liberated; but doubtless the deed of manumission had
                        not been so stringently made out as it should have been in order to release
                        Demarion, absolutely and forever, from all claims on the part of his once
                        owner Heraclides.</p>
                    <p>The Aramaic papyrus in the library at Strasburg which was edited in 1903 by
                        Professor Eating dated from the time of Darius I., about B. C. 410. Some
                        other fragmentary papyri with Aramaic writing found about the same time in a
                        pyramid at Sakkara and presented to the French Academy have been, though in
                        a very fragmentary condition, partly elucidated by M. Clermont Ganneau. A
                        small piece of connected text upon one of these refers to the 29th year of a
                        King Artaxerxes. If this is Artaxerxes Longimanus this gives its time of
                        engrossment as B. C. 436.</p>
                    <p>M. Ganneau last May read at the "Académie des Inscriptions" a paper upon
                        another Aramaic papyrus from Elephantine, which is also of the Persian
                        epoch. It concerns a loan to a Persian functionary by a Jew of 1000 shekels
                        of silver, interest to be payable monthly.</p>

                    <p>In my previous paper I stated my intention. to deal with a very important
                        matter connected with morality in my next. I find, however, that it is a
                        subject totally unfitted for treatment in a column that is made up of the
                        random thoughts of a vagrant mind, and must be dealt with in a different
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>**</p>
                    <p>But I will just say that if any readers of the Gazette are curious enough to
                        wish to be enlightened on the matter, that excellent man whom I think I am
                        justified in calling "The good Samaritan of the Asile Rudolph" will tell
                        them of what I can justly term a great and pressing need for strong effort
                        to cope with a crying evil.</p>
                    <p>During the last few weeks the attention of the whole world has been centred
                        upon the doings of the Baltic Fleet. Whether one approves of war, or simply
                        detests what (to me) is a barbarous and senseless way of settling disputes
                        between nations, it is simply impossible to regard without intense interest,
                        the great drama that is in course of enactment at the present time: one full
                        of incident-tragic, pathetic, and sometimes ludicrous.</p>
                    <p>Much has been written on the supposed connection between the sailing of the
                        Baltic Fleet and the siege of Port Arthur. Possibly it will be found when
                        the history of the war comes to be written, and the real facts disclosed,
                        that far from the fleet being sent as a forlorn hope to succour the
                        beleaguered fortress, its despatch was determined upon at an early stage of
                        the war-perhaps immediately after the Japanese navy had established its
                        command of the sea in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>Seven or eight months is not a very long time to occupy in preparing the
                        ships and making arrangements for their needs during the long voyage before
                        them. Every day brings its testimony to the completeness of the arrangements
                        made by the Russian Government, and as we hear of this or that ship coming
                        from the Black Sea, the crafty purchase of a swift destroyer built on the
                        Thames, the gigantic supplies of coal, the many transports employed, and the
                        store ships accompanying the fleet, we realise somewhat of the forethought
                        and skill lavished upon what I think is fully expected by the Russians to be
                        the means of giving the Russian combined fleets the command of the sea.</p>
                    <p>**</p>
                    <p>That the fleet will succeed in reaching Vladivostock I do not doubt, nor that
                        it will be a very powerful factor in determining the result of next year's
                        campaign in Manchuria. At the present time it seems to be proceeding at a
                        very leisurely pace and may not arrive at its destination for a long time;
                        but this expedition has been planned with consummate skill and may do great
                        deeds and achieve great results, spite of the ridicule that has been, and
                        still is, poured upon it.</p>
                    <p>On the unfortunate Dogger Bank occurrence I will say nothing the matter is to
                        all intents and purposes sub judice, and when the Commission has decided the
                        case there will be plenty of time to discuss the question in all its
                        bearings. This cannot possibly be done at present.</p>
                    <p>A second matter of universal interest is Port Arthur. Its stubborn defence
                        has surprised the world,-with the possible exception of the Russians, who, I
                        think, from the first, never doubted their power to offer a strenuous
                        resistance to the Japanese attack, and even now do not expect to have to
                        surrender to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>An interesting statement made by an officer of the French General Staff in
                        the columns of the Echo de Paris places the terrific difficulties the
                        Japanese have to encounter in their attempt to reduce the fortress in a very
                        strong light. He remarks that the Russians have given their adversaries four
                        series of obstacles to surmount, viz., the advance works, the first line of
                        forts, the second line of forts, and the redoubts, that before the second
                        obstacle they have stuck since the beginning of July, and that it may yet be
                        two or three months before they surmount it, but that when they do so Port
                        Arthur will be untenable for the Russians.</p>
                    <p>But before the Japanese can themselves occupy the place, they must destroy
                        the second line of forts, and when that is done they will be under the fire
                        of the three redoubts which are constructed in the solid rock. Sapping to
                        them will be impossible owing to their position, and well provisioned and
                        supplied with ammunition they can hold out for a long time and effectually,
                        prevent the Japanese from occupying Port Arthur itself.</p>
                    <p>He says in conclusion: "It looks as if we shall get the astonishing
                        spectacle, unprecedented in history, of a place which belongs no longer to
                        anyone; abandoned by the defenders, untenable by the assailants, and this
                        situation, failing the arrival of help for the defenders, will be
                        indefinitely prolonged."</p>
                    <p>It will indeed be strange if a deadlock comes both at Port Arthur and Mukden
                        and a most remarkable dramatic surprise if this is put an end to by the
                        arrival on the scene of the much talked-of and often-ridiculed Baltic
                        Fleet.</p>
                    <p>I could not resist the temptation to say a few words on these two absorbing
                        questions of the day and have not left myself much space for dealing with
                        other matters. One thing I should like to touch upon-a question of great
                        local importance.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>Thursday week's Gazette contained in one column the announcement that it was
                        impossible to form a quorum at the meeting of the Municipal Commission
                        summoned for Wednesday, and at which Mr. G. B. Alderson's motion on the
                        Housing Question would have been discussed, and in another an official
                        statement on the question in the shape of a "report" from Mr. Chataway.</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>May I ask it it is a usual thing for a "report" of this kind to be published
                        in the newspapers, prior to the discussion, at the proper time and place,
                        viz., a meeting of the Commission, of a question raised by one of its
                        members? Mr. Chataway's "report" is nothing but a reply to Mr. Alderson and
                        seems to me quite out of place.</p>
                    <p>The Housing Question is one that wants to be thoroughly thrashed out, and a
                        full and searching enquiry is the only means of getting at the truth of the
                        assertions made by those in favor of action in the matter, and those who
                        consider such action uncalled for. Either the necessity for better housing
                        exists, or it does not, but I fail to see how Mr. Chataway's 'report' helps
                        to solve the question in the smallest degree.</p>
                    <p>What with this action on the part of a public official, the refusal of the
                        Municipal Commission to admit the Press to its meetings, and the failure to
                        form a quorum on a recent occasion, an Englishman imperfectly acquainted
                        with Egyptian (political) manners and customs is apt to come to the
                        conclusion that Municipal institutions, as he has been accustomed to
                        understand the term, are somewhat strangely managed in Alexandria.</p>

                    <p>[ PRELIMINARY NOTE.]</p>
                    <p>BY ANDREW BALFOUR, M.D., B.Sc., M.R.C.P. EDIN., D.P.H. CAMB.,</p>
                    <p>Director, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Gordon College, Khartoum.</p>
                    <p>On staining some films of the blood of a donkey which had been brought from
                        the Bahr el-Ghazal province in the sumther of 1903 by Colonel Griffith,
                        D.S.O., Principal Veterinary Officer in the Sudan, I found trypanosomes
                        present. El Bimbashi Head, of the Veterinary Department, assisted by Dr. J.
                        B. Christopheron, likewise found these parasites in the blood of mules from
                        the same region. These finds were to be expected, as the tsetse fly has been
                        known to exist in those districts since first reported by the Pethericks at
                        Runbek in 1869. Glossina morsitans was found by Colonel Griffith last year
                        on the Pongo River at the place where the road from Wau to Dem Zobeir
                        crosses it, the most northerly point of occur rence yet recorded for the
                        Sudan. Several specimens, all of the same species, have been sent me by
                        Captain Brakenridge, E.M.C., at present stationed in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. The
                        above-mentioned trypanosomes appear to be trypanosoma brucei, but the whole
                        subject has taken an additional interest by the discovery of trypanosomes in
                        the blood of cattle from Kodok (late Fashoda).</p>
                    <p>The cattle in question were members of a herd purchased by a Greek trader in
                        the Shilluk country and brought by him to a place some fifteen miles from
                        Khartoum. There the animals were inspected by Bimbashi Head, Army Veterinary
                        Department, who, suspecting that the disease amongst them might have been
                        induced by tsetse bites, secured blood films. On submitting these to
                        examination in the laboratory, trypanosomes were found. One of the diseased
                        cattle, in whose blood many parasites were present, was slaughtered, and the
                        trypanosomes were found in smears made from the liver and spleen, while in
                        the cerebrospinal fluid amoeboid forms were discovered closely resembling
                        those mentioned by Castellani as occurring in the cerebro-spinal fluid in
                        sleeping sickness, and by Plimmer and Bradford in the bone marrow in cases
                        of nagana. Further, long chains of streptococci were present in smears made
                        from the spinal fluid. These were possibly the results of contamination, but
                        are interesting in the light of Castellani's preliminary work in Uganda.</p>
                    <p>In an ox which died of the disease and in whose blood trypanosomes had been
                        demonstrated, a most curious condition of pigmented ulceration was disclosed
                        in the mucous membrane of the stomach. At present I am <cb n="6"/> not
                        inclined to regard this as having any association with the trypanosomiasis.
                        Another ox suffering from bovine nagana is now under observation, and it is
                        hoped that the condition may be fully investigated. On this ox I found large
                        numbers of a tick, the male possessing a brilliantly-ornamented scutum and
                        striped legs. I think it belongs to the genuo amblyomnia, or possibly is the
                        species variegatum-an African variety of which I have no detailed
                        description.</p>
                    <p>The question of human trypanosomiasis in the Sudan is important, owing to the
                        geographical position of the country and, in the light of Rogers's work, the
                        fact that the Leishman-Donovan bodies were found last year by Dr. Sheffield
                        Neave in the spleen of a boy from Meshra-el-Rek, in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. So
                        far trypanosomes have not been discovered in human blood, nor has Glossina
                        palpalis been reported to exist. Dr. Neave, who, thanks to his Excellency
                        the Governor-General and to Mr. Wellcome, has recently been appointed
                        Travelling Pathologist and Naturalist to the Research Laboratories, is now
                        on his way out from England, and will endeavour to investigate the whole
                        subject on the upper reaches of the White Nile and in the Bahr-el-Ghazal
                        province during the present winter. It is hoped that he may be able to
                        localize the existing fly belts and determine what species of Glossina exist
                        and how they are distributed. The question of the occurrence of
                        trypanosomiasis in big game will also be considered.</p>
                    <p>In the Northern Sudan trypanosomiasis has not been proved to exist. I have
                        examined the blood of bats, mudfishes, and small birds and mammals, with
                        negative results. This may be due to the paucity of observations or to the
                        rarity of the larger biting diptera in the neighbourhood of Khartoum. At the
                        same time the recent work of Schaudinn on the halteridium stage in birds,
                        and Chatterjee's discovery in 1902, of a living trypanosome in the stomach
                        of an Anopheles mosquito have to be borne in mind. Much of the wealth of
                        native tribes in the Southern Sudan is represented to be cattle, and it will
                        be a very serious matter if bovine trypanosomiasis is found to exist to any
                        extent, and in a severe form, amongst the Nuers Dinka and Shilluk herds.
                        Portions of the spleen and liver referred to, and a few slide of blood
                        smears, have been forwarded to the London and Liverpool Schools of Tropical
                        Medicine. The form of trypanosome present can thus be compared with the
                        varieties already known from Uganda, East and South Africa, Nigeria,
                        Senegambia, the Congo Free State, and other parts of Africa.</p>
                    <p>Had it not been for Bimbashi Head's knowledge of the subject, and his
                        enthusiasm for the work, the disease would have been missed. As illustrating
                        his interest in the subject, and the difficulties of research in such a
                        country as the Sudan, I may mention that he had to ride thirty miles on
                        several occasions, for the most part in blazing heat, and had to carry the
                        portions of diseased organs, etc., fifteen miles on horseback for purposes
                        of examination. (The Lancet.)</p>

                    <head>FROM CAIRO TO TANGIER.<lb/>EGYPTIAN RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT.</head>
                    <p>The Morning Post has the following article. on the project of a North African
                        line uniting Egypt with Morocco. Whether such a scheme is possible within
                        the immediate future is doubtful, although it is certain that sooner or
                        later such a line will have to be constructed:-- This bold plan has already
                        formed the theme of earnest discussion among those who take large views of
                        Transcontinental communication, and we believe that his Highness the Khedive
                        of Egypt, whose interest in railway development has been most beneficial,
                        expresses warm sympathy with the proposal. It appeals to him because the new
                        line would bring Egypt into close and direct communication with Europe by
                        land as well as by sea. Briefly, the idea is to construct a line along the
                        slopes of the Atlas Mountains or the Mediterranean littoral from Tangier to
                        Cairo. One's first impression is that the scheme is almost too daring in its
                        conception and would be too costly in its execution. But the ground has been
                        inspected, and the conditions are found to be singularly favourable. Indeed,
                        the engineerng difficulties are nowhere such as in these days need hinder a
                        scheme which is otherwise desirable and likely to prove renumerative.</p>
                    <p>THE BEDOUIN DANGER.</p>
                    <p>Over a great part of the route there would be more to fear from the petty
                        interference of predatory tribes than from any natural <cb n="3"/>
                        obstacles. Tracing the new route from England there would be, first the
                        twenty miles. across the Channel, then rail through France to the South of
                        Spain, and again a short sea journey from Gibraltar to Tangier or some other
                        convenient point on the coast of Africa, where the new railway would begin.
                        Its course would lie along the northern borders of Morocco, thence by way of
                        Algeria to Tunis and Tripoli, and onward to Cairo through the Libyan Desert
                        and the great tracts of country over which the Khedive rules. As far as the
                        Moroccan and Algerian sections are concerned there can be no reasonable
                        expectation of opposition from France, which would indeed welcome any sort
                        of development likely to assist in modernising the land over which she now
                        holds an acknowledged protectorate. In Egypt the Khedive's goodwill is
                        already assured, and all that is required is capital for the purpose. That
                        should come quickly when it is realised how great are the traffic
                        possibilities not only to India, China, and the Antipodes, but to Egypt
                        itself, which is steadily increasing in popularity as a resort for all who
                        can afford to winter under brighter conditions than our own country
                        provides.</p>
                    <p>CAPE TO CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>If a Cape to Cairo railway becomes one of the actualities of the future, the
                        new line would make it possible to travel from London to Capetown overland
                        except when crossing the Channel and from Gibraltar to Tangier-a mere
                        infinitesimal fraction of the whole distance. But the gain to all Far
                        Eastern travellers would be immediate, and when we consider the amazing
                        conquests of nature accomplished by the builders of the Canadian Pacific
                        Railway and by those who conquered the Rocky Mountains on the way to San
                        Francisco or Vancouver, we do not think it probable that a plan for linking
                        more closely the wealthiest portions of East and West is likely to fail for
                        lack of means to carry it through.</p>
                    <p>KHEDIVE'S ENTERPRISE.</p>
                    <p>We have said that the Khedive displays warm sympathy with railway
                        development. This is proved by the interest he has shown in the Mariout
                        Railway, which is being rapidly transformed from narrow to broad gauge under
                        his direction. But it is a small and local scheme by comparison with the
                        Tangier to Cairo line, which we have the best possible reason to believe is
                        deeply interesting his Highness and those who share his keen desire to
                        realise to the fullest possible extent all the advantages that a denghtful
                        climate and a singularly favourable geographical position confer on Egypt.
                        While Great Britain and France were still at variance as to their respective
                        interests in Morocco and Egypt no proposal such as we have been able to
                        describe was likely to obtain consideration solely on its merits.
                        International jealousies would have blocked the way, but these are happily
                        removed, and with their disappearance new possibilities of peaceful
                        development have arisen which may benefit East and West substantially if
                        they are wisely used in the interests of more rapid and convenient inter-
                        communication.</p>

                    <head>La langue Francaise en Egypte</head>
                    <p>M. Braun, après avoir signalé dans sa revue la disparition graduelle du
                        françai de l'Egypte, s'est rendu lui-même à Paris pour plaider la cause de
                        la langue française M. Souvestre, du Soleil, nous relate ainsi une de ses
                        entrevues :-</p>
                    <p>"Il serait puéril,dit M.Braun,de nier que l'Angleterra ait beaucoup fait pour
                        l'E- gypte, mais jusqu'ici elle avait concentré son activité à de vastes
                        travaux publics que ont assuré au peuple la prospérité maté arielle. Elle va
                        s'occuper maitenant du côté moral de l'instruction et des écoles, celest
                        inévitable: D'un peuple riche on va faire un peuple instruit, et les huit
                        mi!- lions d'Egyptiens vont s'infiltrer lentement la culture anglaise, les
                        idées anglaises et leurs livres, s'habitueront de plus en plus à parler la
                        langue de leurs gouvernants. Certes, le français est encore beaucoup parlé
                        en Egypte à l'heure actuell. Cela tient, non seulement, à ce que la
                        génération présente, élevée selon les idées anciennes, ne connaît presque
                        pas l'anglais, mais encore à ce que l'immigration, très abondante ces
                        dernières années, a amené en Egypte un nombre très grand d'éléments
                        disparates qui tous se voient obligés de communier en français, la seule
                        langue. actuellement qui puisse servir la vanité des nouveaux venus en leur
                        donnant accès dans la haute société, où elle est parlée. Dans vingt ans, il
                        n'en sera plus de même.</p>
                    <p>"L'anglais, langue par excellence des affaires, du commerce, de l'industrie,
                        est seule à donner accès aux situations enviées du fonctionnarisme. C'est
                        lui qui aura 1. préférence. Déjà nous pouvons constater que, dans les
                        examens officiels, la proportion des candidats français diminue de façon
                        notable."</p>
                    <p>M. Fernand Braun cite alors quelques chiffres édifiants: o'est ainsi qu'il y
                        a six ans, sur 800 candidats au baccalauréat, 240 concouraient en français
                        et 60 en anglais. Aujourd'hui c'est l'inverse.</p>
                    <p>Voici maintenant le remède :</p>
                    <p>"Notre but,poursuit-il, doit être de garder à notre langue son caractère de
                        nécessité. Il faut que toujours nos penseurs, no- écrivains, nos poètes, nos
                        livres, nos revaes, nos journaux, se trouvent entre toutes les mains; qu'au
                        salon, au théâtre, au café, à la Bourse, notre langue soit parlée, et que
                        nous fessions en quelque sorte une obligation à tous les Egyptiens de
                        connaître le français, sinon à l'exclusion de l'anglais, au moins
                        conjointement avec lui. Mais les Français de France doivent Bussi faire
                        quelque chose pour leurs fères d'Egypte. On distribue tant d'argent en
                        France, dans les académies, les Fociétés littéraires, pour couronner des
                        écrivains (t des œuvres qui ne serviront jamais notre gloire ni notre
                        influence, que si l'on en consaorait une partie très congrue à ouvrir en
                        Egypte, dans tous les centres importants, des cabinets de lecture gratuits,
                        à subventionner des troupes théâtrales de bon aloi qui nous feraient
                        connaître les chefe d'œuvre de notre théâtre classique et contemporain, à
                        nous envoyer de temps à autre des conférenciers éloquents et bien: inspirés,
                        à organiser des concours littéraires parmi les Egyptiens, l'on ferait,
                        dis-je, couvre saine et profitable.</p>
                    <p>Et M. Braun, continuant l'exposé de son plan d'action, voudrait voir créer en
                        Egypte par le Gouvernement français un collège officiel. où enseigneraient
                        des professeurs de l'Université.</p>

                    <p>Liverpool, December 1.</p>
                    <p>The demand for Egyptian Cotton has been small, and quotations of 'Brown' are
                        5/16 and 'Upper' pr. lb. lower. Futures have been in fairly active demand;
                        the following are the latest values:</p>
                    <p>Dec. 7.53 Feb. 7.32 Apl. 7.29. Jan. 7.37 Mar. 7.30 May 7.29.</p>
                    <p>American Futures. The Market this week has been very active, but with
                        considerable pressure to sell, the tendency of prices has been downwards;
                        to-day's closing values being 34 @ 28 points below those of last Thursday.
                        The heavy crop movements, pressure to sell against purchases of actual
                        cotton, and the liquidation of large "Bull" interests have weighed upon the
                        Market. The misleading move of Mr. Price on Saturday and Monday, which
                        caused a great deal of buyingsubsequently thrown out in disgust when it
                        became evident that he had recognised his mistake and was himself
                        reselling-greatly intensified the weakness. The Bureau report to be issued
                        on Saturday next will be very important, and as the Market has been heavily
                        sold out, and prices are now in the neighbourhood of 42 pr. lb., we believe
                        that may prove, at any rate for the immediate ture, a turning point.</p>

                    <p>A prominent member of the German colony at Alexandria sends us the
                        following:-</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,-In regard to the article published in the XIX Century about an
                        interview with Count von Bülow, wherein the German Chancellor deplored the
                        hostility and the suspicions raised in Great Britain against Germany, may
                        state that Count von Bülow has expressed himself very often in this way
                        lately, only the English public hear very little about it, and the following
                        record of an interview which Count Bülow had the other day with a member of
                        the Continental Correspondence may therefore not be without interest to your
                        readers :-</p>
                    <p>Count Bülow said:</p>
                    <p>With regard to the disssemination, chiefly by the Times, of all such false
                        intelligence, as that there is "a secret German-Russian treaty regarding
                        East Asia," "Germany's intentions. with respect to mediation between Russia
                        and Japan," "Germany's interference in the Tibet treaty," I might content
                        myself with the two impolite, but striking words with which Lord John
                        Russell, Minister of Foreign Affairs under Palmerston, characterised the
                        endeavours of South German journals in 1859 to entangle the German States in
                        the Austro-Franco-Italian war-"loose tattle." As Providence however has
                        bestowed upon me a fair amount of natural politeness, I will deal with the
                        imputations in detail.</p>
                    <p>All information as to a secret German- Russian treaty referring to East Asia
                        is fanciful creation. Of what should such a treaty consist, since indeed
                        during the war, now of more than nine months' duration, Germany has shown
                        that it wishes to remain neutral and will not break this neutrality on
                        behalf of either of the belligerents? It is true that the trading
                        transactions by which private firms have supplied goods to Russia, have been
                        played off against the German Government. But in all times people belonging
                        to a third State have tried to do business in a private capacity with the
                        powers at strife. In 1870 English dealers in small arms supplied the French
                        with rifles; during the Boer war Hungary and various American States
                        provided the English troops with horses, and now French, English, and German
                        contractors have declared themselves willing to supply the Russian warships
                        with coal. I have assured myself that this business is chiefly done with
                        English coal in German and English ships and certainly only in neutral
                        harbours. This inclination of private persons to do business with the
                        parties engaged in war is easily understood. In the first place, because
                        countries at war as a rule pay higher prices, and secondly, because trade
                        and industry are so very much injured by war between great states, that they
                        wish at least to find some compensation in supplying goods. As the English
                        Government fails to forbid the export of coal by legal enactment, so must we
                        also allow German ships a share in the transport of coal to neutral
                        ports.</p>
                    <p>Germany has not the least intention of interfering in any way whatever for
                        the bringing about of peace between Russia and Japan. By neither of the two
                        powers is any such step desired, and Germany itself would have nothing but
                        disadvantage re- 'sulting from such a course of action. That delightful
                        scene in Dickens' "Pickwick Papers" comes to my mind, how Pickwick attempted
                        to make peace between two men, who had come to fisticuffs, whereupon the men
                        immediately desisted from fighting but began to belabour the gallant
                        Pickwick with coal-shovels and The German other unfriendly instruments.
                        Michael has become by long centuries of suffering too clever to wish to play
                        the part of Pickwick.</p>
                    <p>You know very well what we say in Germany about a liar, "he lies like print,"
                        and that my great predecessor extended this by saying that in this age of
                        telegraphy it should not be said "he lies like print" but it must run "he
                        lies like the telegraph." This hits off the position exactly with regard to
                        the long telegram from Peking, received by the Times, and that reported all
                        sorts of things about German intrigues against the English-Tibet treaty In
                        the whole story, this only is true, that the German Ambassador had enquired
                        at the Chinese Foreign Office if the text of the treaty published by a Pekin
                        newspaper without its consent were authentic. But at the same time the
                        Ambassador explained that the German Empire took no interest in this treaty.
                        He had thus done exactly the opposite of what the Times maintained. Whether
                        Russsia feel unpleasantly touched by the course of the Tibetan affair is its
                        own concern. For <cb n="2"/> German political interests Tibet is still more
                        a matter of indifference than Manchuria. The energetic carrying out of the
                        difficult expedition to Tibet has found acknowledgment in our military
                        circles, and we understand therefore very well that the English are very
                        proud of this performance, and that they are accordingly doubly sensitive,
                        lest they should be done out of the fruits of their difficult enterprise. To
                        attempt that is tar from our thoughts, as we have no interests in Tibet,
                        and, as we have repeatedly shown, we wish to place ourselves on a friendly
                        footing with England.</p>
                    <p>Germany entertains no policy of interference, nor of territorial conquest
                        either in East Asia, Central Asia, nor in Asia Minor. Its desire is to
                        attempt to extend – and in this it is indeed forced by the rapid increase of
                        the population on a proportionally small area – the possibilities of German
                        economic development through the export trade.</p>
                    <p>We wish to attain this aim in a straight-forward way, without intrigues,
                        without suspicions, and without belittling others, merely by our own
                        efforts. I consider the English people and the skilful pioneers of English
                        civilisation and economic life abroad to be proud and self-respecting enough
                        to desire to compete with us only in the same way, that is, by skilfulness
                        in their achievements.</p>

                    <p>ST. LOUIS EXHIBITION.</p>
                    <p>The question of infant feeding is of such pre-eminent importance, and
                        Mellin's Food is so widely employed in this country, that mothers will learn
                        with satisfaction that the preparations of Mellin's Food have again
                        succeeded in securing the highest public recognition of their excellence
                        before the learned Jury appointed by the World's Fair at the St. Louis,
                        Exhibition, U.S.A. We understand that this body has awarded the Grand Prize
                        to Mellin's Food over all other infants' foods, which is the highest honour
                        granted. A gold medal has also been granted for Mellin's Food Biscuits.
                        These remarkable successes point to the unequalled estimate in which the
                        Mellin's Food preparations are held in America, and should serve as a
                        further recommendation to the public in general as to their sterling value.
