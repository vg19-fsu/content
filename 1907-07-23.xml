                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                    <head>THE THEORY OF LIFE ON MARS.</head>
                    <p>On Saturday, July 6, the planet Mars and the Earth were in "opposition," and
                        astronomers were basy with telescopes and cameras observing and obtaining
                        photographic impressions of our nearest neighbour in the celestial ether. </p>
                    <p>"Project yourself into the future, if you can, and imagine this Earth as it
                        will be some millions of years hence. At that remote period its mountains
                        will have been levelled, its fertile areas will have shrivelled to arid
                        deserts; its gases will partly have floated away, and its atmosphere will
                        consequently have been impoverished and attenuated; its weather will have
                        become so wearisomely unvaried, its skies so monotonously serene that the
                        passage of a cloud will be chronicled by historians; its seas and its lakes
                        will have dried up utterly; its oceans will have poured through cracks and
                        caverns into its interior ; and all the water that now covers four-fifths of
                        its surface will have dwindled to a small plain of ice and snow deposited
                        about each Pole. That image of the Earth's future plight may be considered a
                        fairly accurate picture of the present condition of Mars, as it has been
                        anfolded by the. more recent discoveries," says Mr. Waldemar Kaempffert, in
                        the July "Windsor." </p>
                    <p>Prof. Lester Ward contributes an article on Mars to the "Brown Alumni
                        Monthly", of which the "Westminster Gazette" gives a long abstract. The
                        Professor "assumes that Mars has passed through much the same stages as the
                        Barth has done, and, applying the geological principle of uniformitarianism,
                        he finds an exact parallel between the two planets up to the end of their
                        respective Tertiary periods. He then states that we have now the best
                        reasons for supposing that the Psychozoic age, upon which we are but just
                        entering, so to speak, began on Mars at the opening of the Quaternary
                        period." </p>
                    <p>"The visible aspect of Mars has been altered in such a way as to show that
                        the social efficiency of the Martian race is at a far higher level than we
                        have yet attained. We see a race of vast antiquity and supreme wisdom
                        clinging desperately to the place of its birth, balf gasping for breath,
                        hoarding up every drop of its precious water, but doomed in the
                        comparatively near future to face the lingering death of a dying world. In
                        like manner, we too must anticipate the soene which Prof. Ward deftly
                        expresses by changing two letters in the famous line from Horace : 'voir le
                        dernier (hu)main à son dernier soupir.' A gloomy picture I to which he
                        claims there is another side of the quarter of a million years of man's life
                        on earth he has been conscious of his existence about 10,000 years, and only
                        within 2000 years has accomplished anything of value, to himself ; while his
                        great work may be said to have been accomplished within the last two
                        centuries. The Psychozoic age, therefore, still lies before him." </p>
                    <p>" What science has definitely ascertained up to now about Mars," said Sir
                        William Huggins to a "Daily News" representative, "is that there is ice
                        formed at the poles of the planet, and that this mass of congealed matter
                        melts when the Martian summer occurs. It has been further ascertained that
                        there are markings on the planet itself, in the shape of lines more or less
                        straight. The existence of some of these marking, has been since confirmed
                        by photographs taken by Mr. Per. cival Lowell, of the Lowell Observatory, in
                        Arizona. But to jump to the conclusion, as Mr. Lowell does, that the
                        markings are canals out or dog by the inhabitants of Mars cannot be regarded
                        as absolutely certain. That Mars is inhabited may not be an impossibility,
                        in the light of our present knowledge of the conditions of life." </p>

                        <p>A burglar made an unsuccessful attempt last Friday week to break into the
                            house of Mr. Papini, the proprietor of the Gordon Hotel, Khartoum. But
                            Mr. Papini discovered him on the premises and scared him off with one or
                            two pistol shots. Word was sent to the police, who at once started
                            investigations that are expected to lead to the discovery and arrest of
                            the culprit. A remarkable fact, however, about the affair was that no
                            ghaffir appeared on the scene, in spite of the commotion which
                            necessarily ensued. A Curse of the Sudan.</p>

                            by Queen Hatshepsu withir the cliff circle of Deir el-Bahari, has been

                            completed, and the whole building is cleared. The date assigned to the
                            temple is about 2700 B.C. The site was indicated some 16 centuries later
                            by a Royal Commission o the XXth Dynasty, which reported that "the

                        very poor, and the hot weather was also a great drawback.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday the "Barham" arrived and anchored inside the harbour. On the
                        saine day a garden party wasgiven in the well-known garden of Rustein Pasha
                        overlooking the Beyrout river. On the 14th instant a paper chase was
                        organzed, and, despite the heat, this exciting sport was greatly enjoyed by
                        our visitors From the sea, whose life is circumscribed by steel barriers and
                        the dimensions of a warship.</p>
                    <p>On the 15th an "At Home" was held by the Admiral, and invitations were sent
                        to the members of the British Colony and some of the notabilities of the
                        town. The after deck</p>
                    <p>designed for the reception was tastefully decorated with flags and flowers.
                        The mess room was converted into a buffet, and one of the casemates into a
                        bar and smoking room for gentlemen. In the evening the Vali, at a
                        suggestion, it is said, froin high quarters at Constantinople, gave a dinner
                        at Seraglio to the Admiral and this staff. The Consular Corps and other
                        notables were also invited.</p>
                    <p>On the 17th the Admiral returned the compliment by a banquet on board the
                        flagship, to which were also invited some of the chief civil and military
                        authorities. The after-deck was beautifully illuminated and outlined by a
                        row of multicolored electric globes. The band header its programme with the
                        Turkish National hymn, thus reciprocating the courtesy of the British
                        National Anthem having been the first welcoming air played by the Turkish
                        hand during the dinner at the Seraglio.</p>
                    <p>Early yesterday morning the flagship and the "Irresistible" sailed, and
                        immediately after the "Venerable" and the "Prince of Wales" arrived from
                        Jafia. The customary exchange of salutes was made. In the afternoon of the
                        same day the second cruiser "Diana" arrived from Port Said and delivered the
                        mail under quarantine.</p>

                    <head>THE NILE</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes :</p>
                    <p>After reading your review of Captain Lyon's works the following thought,
                        occurred to me and may, to the student of cause and effect, provide an
                        interesting article.</p>
                    <p>1. The Nile, depending on rainfall, rainfall on evaporation, we come to the
                        question-what effect had the clearing of the sudd on the Nile flood ?</p>
                    <p>2. The sadd itself, being gradual growth, gradually retarded the floods, as
                        gradually increased the area of evaporation i.e. the swamps in the Soudan,
                        until the increased weight of water itself forced a passage through and made
                        by its action a clear river once more. From the above might be deduced the
                        theory that the one and sole cause of Egypt's seven years lean and seven
                        years of plenty was explained in one word--sudd. </p>
                    <p>i distinctly remember the flood following the year in which the Soudan
                        officials cleared the sudd : it rose rapidly, earlier than usual, but was as
                        quickly over and following it was a very poor summer supply. The early
                        volume of the flood caused great uneasiness and anticipation of disaster to
                        the banks etc. The following year, according to the seven years theory, we
                        should have had an increased volume, but this did not happen and there has
                        only been one year of fairly average flood, since, that of 1906. So that by
                        artificially clearing the obstruction it may be that all previous data bas
                        been made useless. In studying ont the question there is of course another
                        question, does the water evaporated in the swamps fall locally or has it a
                        wider influence, the direction and force of the monsoons will doubtless
                        provide this information, but it must influence the local rainfall to a
                        certain extent. </p>
                    <p>The subject is interesting and would be worth following by examination of
                        statistics of the different years that have been compiled, also a comparison
                        of good years or the reverse in Egypt, with the same periods in India. </p>

                    <p>THEORIES TO BE CONSIDERED.</p>
                    <p>So great has been the interest aroused by the mystery of the death of
                        Vivante, that peculation as to the mode in which the Leceased met his death
                        is made on all sides, nd new theories are offered daily by woulde amateur
                        detectives. We, however, as our eaders are well aware, have been at great
                        pains o obtain the follest and latest details daily, nd in consequence of
                        the many suggestions which are being offered by those who have nerely
                        followed the details from day to day we onsider that it will be useful to
                        recapitulate he event in its entirety. All information which me publish is
                        from those who met the deceased on the night on which the crime was
                        comnitted, for we naturally agree with the authorities in the rejection of
                        the theory of suicide. </p>
                    <p>The Night OF THE CREME.- According to Mr. Conegliano, on the evening of the
                        crime, Vivante took supper with Mr. Conegliano. At </p>
                    <p>quarter to ten he bade good night to mis host, and went to the café Mohamed
                        Aly, </p>
                    <p>ituated in the Place des Consuls (Rue de la Poste). </p>
                    <p>According to Mr. Nacamuli, Vivante was net by him at the café at 11.15 p.m.
                        and conmersed with him until half past one in the morning, at which hour
                        they went together to </p>
                    <p>he hotel, where both of them were staying. Mr. Nacamuli remained with Vivante
                        in the atter's bedroom until a quarter to two, at which moment he returned
                        to his rooms, and ne declares that throughout the night he did not hear any
                        noise. At five minutes to eight Mr. Nacamuli was hurriedly called to see the
                        body of Vivante. </p>
                    <p>The following are the depositions of the commercial traveller in jewellery
                        who occupied che next room to Vivante :- About a quarter co three in the
                        morning he heard a noise in Vivante's room, a muffled vocal sound, and a
                        neavy thud on the floor. The noise lasted abont Cour minutes, and he then
                        heard someone open and shut the door and go along the corridor, and then his
                        attention was attracted by the closing of another door. From that moment
                        until the hotel was astir he heard no Further noise. </p>
                    <p>At five minutes to eight (following the infor. mation afforded us by the
                        proprietor) Vivante's servant went to take the morning's mail to his naster.
                        Knocking at the door, he received no Answer and therefore entered the room
                        unang vered. Seeing Vivante lying at the foot of his ped his head hanging
                        down over his chest, with a mope which was unknotted, round his neck, the
                        servant called the man in attendance, who afterwards called the proprietor
                        of the hotel. The latter removed the rope, and struck the victim of the
                        crime across the face with a wet towel. . </p>
                    <p>The deceased was wearing his under-vest and stockings and his feet were
                        entangled in the inosquito net, which had been torn. The bedclothes had not
                        been drawn down and verything in the room was in order. The shutters were
                        closed but the window was open. Vivante, it will be remembered, never locked
                        the door of his room. The proprietor suspects no one but the young and fair
                        man who had engaged a room the same evening and had presented a visiting
                        card which did not belong to him and bore the name of Mr. de Bellegarde. </p>
                    <p>THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.--The hotel in which the crime took place has a court
                        in the centre and the rooms are placed in a double row on each floor. The
                        room which Vivante occupied was on the second storey near the staircase and
                        with a window looking upon the street. Next to and communicating with
                        Vivante's room was that occupied on the night by the travelling jeweller,
                        Mr. Koch. This room was at an angle of the building. On the same floor and
                        almost at the diagonally opposite angle was the room which was occupied by
                        Nacamuli, and that which was engaged by the young man upon whom strong
                        suspicion of implication in the affair has fallen, is abont half way between
                        those of Nacamuli and Vivante respectively. </p>
                    <p>MOST PROBABLE THEORY.-According to these facts, the most probable theory of
                        the committal of the crime is that Vivante was surprised by his assassin, as
                        he had neither time to shout or make an effort to defend himself. If the
                        murderer were hidden under the bed he could not have reached Vivante without
                        attracting his attention, and on the other hand be could not have entered by
                        the door without Vivante hearing the opening and closing of it, and the
                        man's footsteps. How is it, too, if such were the case that the commercial
                        traveller heard someone leave the room immediately after the crime, but
                        heard no one enter it before? </p>
                    <p>We can only suppose two things :-(1) that the assassin was known to Vivante,
                        who did not fear any attack from him, (2) that he was hidden under the bed
                        and waited until Vivante was asleep. This latter theory, however, is
                        discountenanced by the fact that the bed was not disturbed, as it must
                        inevitably have been had Vivante been strangled while sleeping and dragged
                        on to the floor. </p>
                    <p>The remaining theory, therefore, is that Vivante met his death at the hands
                        of an acquaintance of sufficient intimacy that he would undress before him.
                        In such a case the assassin must have cleverly concealed the rope and at a
                        moment when Vivante's back was turned quiokly twisted it round his neck and
                        by a sharp turn smartly garrotted his victim with a coup du Père François, </p>
                    <p>A similar theory is also accepted by the police, with the exception that two
                        persons were concerned. By this theory Vivante was engaged in conversation
                        with an acquaintance and was taken by surprise from behind, the accomplice
                        whipping the rope round his neck, and the rope then being drawn tight by
                        both men. </p>

                    <p>op of commandanesen, as or</p>
                    <p>In a note on the relation between the Belgians in the Congo and south-western
                        Sudan territory the "Sudan Times" writes : </p>
                    <p>"The evacuation by the Belgian authorities of the stations they had occupied
                        within Sudan territory is reported by our Egyptian contemporary,
                        "Al-Akhbar." This marks the last stage in the settlement of the difficulty
                        that had ensued between the two Governments about this matter. </p>
                    <p>"The trouble began, as may be remembered, when Commandant Lumière with a
                        force made up of native troops and Belgian officers, made an expedition into
                        Sudan territory, which was claimed for purely scientific purposes. </p>
                    <p>"It was discovered however by an officer who had been sent by the Sudan
                        Government on a 1 punitive, expedition against the rebellous Chief Yamibo,
                        that the Belgian expedition was more military than scientific, and that they
                        had occupied several points beyond the borders of the Congo State or the
                        Lado Enclave. The Sudan Government protested against this occupation and
                        requested the Belgian forces to withdraw. This they refused to do, claiming
                        that the stations they occupied were located in their own territory. </p>
                    <p>"Thereupon the Sudan Government issued orders forbidding the transport of any
                        provisions or other goods by Bahr el Gebel steamers to the Lado. The
                        controversy about the disputed territory was then transferred to London and
                        Brussels"; and was ultimately settled by the Belgian Government agreeing to
                        withdraw its troops from the disputed stations and reiterating its agreement
                        to withdraw from the Lado upon the death of King Leopold. </p>
                    <p>"On its part, the Sudan Government consented to allow the construction by the
                        Congo Free State of a railway connecting the Congo with the Nile, which
                        would serve as an outlet for the Congo State and in the same time be very
                        beneficial to the Sudan. </p>
                    <p>The Sudan Government has recently sent &amp; commission consisting of
                        Bimbashi Newcombe, of the Sudan Government Railways, and three officers of
                        the Egyptian Army. They were to meet with three Belgian delegates and
                        together make the preliminary surveys necessary for the projected Nile-Congo
                        Railway. </p>
                    <p>"We have as yet received no information from the Government about the work
                        accomplished by this commission, which by the way has not yet returned from
                        its mission, as incorrectly stated in some Egyptian papers. But we are in
                        hope that the Government will supply us with full information about the work
                        of this committee, as well as abont the points evacuated by the Belgian
                        troops, and the particulars of the evacuation. </p>
                    <p>"The recent step taken by the Belgian Government, i.e. their decision to
                        annex the Congo Free State, is going to bring that region very prominently
                        into public notice : and information about it will be received by the public
                        with particular interest." </p>

                        Rue Richer, which has been run by Sheikh Abou Naddara. The old Sheikh was
                        very pleased to see me and told me many tales about his Arabic-French organ,
                        which used to defend Egyptian interests | against Ismail. The Sheikh still
                        writes in the interests of the people of Egypt. He is not a follower of

                        considers that the first duty of an Egyptian journalist is to use his pen in

                        very small. The language is used among many Jews here, who are the
                        descendants of those expelled from Spain on August 1st, 1492, by Ferdinand
                        the Catholic, and Isabella of Spain. The Jews who came thence to Egypt were
                        few in number and they soon - lost the use of Castilian for Arabic. Those of
                        their race here, who speak the former tongue, are newcomers from other parts
                        of the Levant. There is a Spanish newspaper in Cairo, "Vara," edited and
                        owned by Mr. Abraham Galante. That gentleman in March gave a lecture on the
                        Spanish language in the Orient, before the Egyptian Institute, and we are
                        glad to find that the lecture has been published in pamphlet form. This
                        little essay is full of interesting facts about a curious philological freak
                        which still continues to flourish after four hundred years. There are quite
                        a number of Spanish newspapers in the Levant at the present time, supported
                        by Spanish speaking Jews. These are "El Tiempo" and "El Telegrafo," of
                        Constantinople, "La Epoca" and "El Avenir," of Salonica, "La Buena
                        Esperanza," "El Novelista," "El Messerret," and "El Comercial," of Smyrna,
                        "El Achofar," of Philippoli, "El Dia," "La Luz," and "La Tolerancia," of
                        Sofia, and "La Vara" of Cairo. We cordially recommend this pamphlet to all
                        interested in the by ways of the Babel of the Eastern Mediterranean. </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "PAYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                        <p>Dear Sir, </p>
                        <p>I see in your journal of the 20th inst. a letter on the "Public Security
                            in Behera" from one who is favourable to British administration. The
                            "terrible accidents" to which he refers are not such, but most carefully
                            thought and worked out plans. One of the chief factors in these crimes
                            is the lust for vengeance for imaginary and actual wrongs ; another is
                            of course the lust for money. I am continually hearing of most brutal
                            murders committed in the Province, there being no fewer than eight to my
                            knowledge since | the latter part of April, the latest being </p>
                        <p>that of a lady. When the details of these crimes are openly discussed,
                            and the names of the perpetrators common property, I cannot imagine why
                            the Government cannot take steps to arrest the criminals. When they are
                            arrested, the case is sometimes distnissed because of the evidence of
                            witnesses, which has | been tampered with. Why these bad characters, who
                            are well known to the Government Officials, are not dispatched to some
                            remote place I cannot make out. There are, in certain districts, gangs
                            of these men who terrorise the whole place, demanding blackmail, and
                            removing those who in any way interfere with their plans. Of course
                            robbery is also one of their amusements, just to let the fellaheen know
                            they must knuckle under. If some of your readers heard only half of what
                            I know is the truth, they would raise an outory. Hoping that the
                            Government has the officials, either native or English, who can bring
                            these criminals to book. </p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "BAYPTIAN GAZETTR." Dear Sir, </p>
                        <p>Native public opinion is rapidly forming. Here is an example of that
                            brilliant, intelligent, splendid capacity of the Arab, with | which the
                            writings of Mustapha Kamel have </p>
                        <p>made us familiar. | Travelling to town from Ramleh last night in the
                            electric railway, I overheard the following conversation between foar
                            Arabs, gravely discusing the political situation and "la Crise." Said
                            one, "It is Lord Cromer who took away all the money with him. On leaving
                            he told the Minister of Finance to give him eighteen million pounds.
                            After he had gone, it was fonnd that he was only entitled to fifteen
                            niillion. So he was requested to return the surplus of three millions,
                            which he forthwith did, being convinced of the mistake." </p>
                        <p>A short pause for grave reflection. "If" commented one of the party
                            "Mustafa Kamel had not sent Lord Cromer away, all that money would still
                            have been in the country."| The obvionsness of this gradually dawned
                            upon the other participators in the discussion. Chorus of approval :
                            "Khawaga, weyak hak." </p>

                        "Al Lowa," shows that the opinion that Lord Cromer deliberately brought
                        about the crisis is industriously propagated in the vernacular press : </p>

                        brought </p>

                        market through spreading unfounded rumours, to the effect that the Egyptian
                        peasantry are, by nature of their present financial state, obliged to sell
                        their cotton crop at any price that might be advanced to them. </p>

                        d'invraisemblable ; elle est même la se probable, car au fond il n'y a
                        absolument de changé la situation tant locale que ge rale. Tout au plus
                        pourrait-on invoquer rapidité exagérée de la baisse, qui devait fo ment un

                            <p>There is inuch apprehension for the safety of the Japanese in the
                                interior when the abdication becomes known. General Hasegawa has
                                only 2800 troops, a number wholly in. adequate. The Korean regiment
                                which furni shed the mutineers has refused to hand over their arms
                                and ammunition and the Japanese are unable to compel them to do so,
                                pending the arrival of reinforcements which are en route from
                                Shimonoseki. Civilian agitators frequently harangue the Korean
                                troops, who possess 90,000 rounds of ammunition. (R.) </p>

                                published in the "Figaro." 11 The Chancellor said that an
                                improvement of the relations between France and Germany had begun.
                                The French could feel assured that Germany would place no obstacles
                                in their path with regard to Morocco. He believed that the two
                                countries might also come to an agreement on economic matters.

                    <p>TÓPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY. av</p>
                    <p>-- Another volume has just been published of the interesting series, which
                        the Survey Department is issuing, dealing with the geology and topography of
                        out-of the way parts of Egypt. The latest work deals with the Eastern
                        portion of the Sinaitic peninsula. From its association Sinai will always
                        occupy &amp; peculiar niche in the history of the world and its physical
                        features are as grand as its historical associations with the sublime Mosaic
                        story. As a recent writer described it </p>
                    <p>"With regard to the mountain climbing, the experience of Mr. Home and his
                        expedition is the same as that of Sir Charles Wilson and the other members
                        of the Ordnanoe Sorvey of Sinai, viz :-that no peak in Sinai is absolutely
                        inacoessible. Mr. Hume's plan was to attack any mountain that was necessary
                        as a station, however formidable it might appear, the attempt being in all
                        cases crowned with success. One other point may be mentioned, viz:--the
                        supposed dangers connected with an expedition in Eastern Sinai. There is no
                        doubt that the Sinai Arab entertains &amp; great dread of the dwellers on
                        the eastern shores of the Gulf of Akaba, the inhabitants of 1. Magna
                        especially having a bad reputation. On only one occasion did Mr. Hume's
                        party feel any necessity for sleeping under arms, this being due to several
                        bosts having put out from Magna to reconnoltre at Dabab, probably in
                        consequence of their having seen our-lights when we were taking some
                        observations on a hill above the camp. Interference by the Turks seemed also
                        to be much feared, but though the expedition worked far north of a line
                        which the chief sheikh, Modakhel, had asked us not to cross, there was no
                        suggestion at any time of danger from this quarter." </p>
                    <p>"The Peninsula of Sinai, or at any rate the greater part of it, is in reality
                        one of the most mountainous and intricate regions on the face of the earth :
                        sand is &amp; feature seldom met with, plains are rather the exception than
                        the rule, the roads are often steep and rugged, and for the most part
                        through a labyrinth of narrow rock-bound valleys. It is a desert, certainly,
                        in the fullest sense of the word, but a desert of rock, gravel, and boulder,
                        of gaunt peaks, dreary ridges, and arid valleys and plateaux, the whole
                        forming a scene of stern desolation which tally merits its description as
                        the "great and terrible wilderness.' So far from there being nothing to
                        survey, the topo grapher may well shrink from the task of delineating its
                        countless intricacies.'" Yet here and there, where after sudden
                        thunderstorms the storm-waters rush down the main valleys, are found some
                        fertile spots, oases of palms, seyal trees and rushes, producing pic: tures
                        full of life and beauty in the midst of the stern hills that surround them.
                        Perennial streams run down the wadis*: of Kyd, Hebran and Isla, in the
                        latter valley forming a small waterfall whose sides are covered with
                        maidenhair fern ; groves of tamarisk and palm fill the upper portions of
                        Nasb gorge; while at Dahab and Nebk the latter fringe the coast-line at the
                        points where the two great drainages of Nasb and Kyd enter the Gulf of
                        Akaba. Nevertheless these occurrences are rare, and in many places, as near
                        Ras Mohammed and in the schistose bills south of Dahab, unmitigated
                        desolation holds sway. </p>
                    <p>The portion of Eastern Sinai considered in this memoir extends from Ain
                        el-Hudera in latitude 29° N. to the southern end of the peninsula at Ras
                        Mohamed, the part most particularly studied and mapped in detail being the
                        triangular area bounded on the north by the transverse range, and to the
                        east and south by the Gulf of Akaba and the Red Sea. This isolated position
                        behind rugged mountain. barriers traversed only by passes, themselves not
                        especially easy, is of itself &amp; reason why this region has been so
                        largely neglected, while in addition, it is at a cousiderable distance from
                        Suez and Tor, the only ports of the peninsula. Thus it requires &amp; six
                        days' journey from Suez to the Shelala Pass, which is the gate of the
                        south-eastern triangle, the same point being reached from Tor in four days,
                        and then only after passing over the steep and boulder-strewn col at the
                        head of the Tarfa valley. </p>
                    <p>The early history of Pastern Sinai is wrapped in obscurity, though many
                        writers believe that the Israelites on leaving Sinai marched to the two
                        famong wells of Wadi-el-Ain and Ain elHudera, their second station, that of
                        Hazeroth, being somewhere in their neighbourhood. Be that as it may, the
                        presence of numerous stone circles of very faried form and often placed in
                        most unexpeeted localities, shows that man was at one time far more widely
                        distributed in the region than he is at present, over thirty perfectly
                        circular stone ciroles being sometimes placed close together on a single
                        gravel terrace. | That these must be of very ancient date is proved by the
                        occurrence of Nabathean (Idumean) inscriptions on some of these building at
                        the foot of Abu Mesud, but there is at present no evidence in support of the
                        Buggestion made by Mr. Holland, thint thoy may have owed their origin to the
                        Amalekite With these exceptions, the reeords are silent, no Borption

                        </floatingText> by Cornelius Palma, prefect of Syria. The Nabatheans were a
                        people from the north-east, who took possession of the commercial route
                        abandoned by the Phoenicians, and from the famous rocky city of Petra
                        commanded the peninsula down to about the period of the birth of Christ. </p>
                    <p>Only with the growth of the monastie principle among the early Christians in
                        the fourth century did this wilderness again become peopled with hermits,
                        who could in these moun. tain fastnesses find thesolitude they sought, and
                        who have left the traces of their presence in the rectangular stone
                        buildings generally low doored and roofless which are situated in the most
                        out-of-the-way localities. </p>
                    <p>These isolated outposts were particularly subject to the inroads of the wild
                        tribes of these mountainous regions, the Saracens and Blemmyes having on
                        several occasions carried out massacres on a large scale, while after the
                        rise of the Moslem power, the mountaineers seem to have made an easy
                        transition to the new religion, and to-day the Sinai Convent alone remains
                        as an interesting relio of the prevalence of monasticism in the peninsula,
                        Although the eastern mountain region thus early ceases to play any part in
                        the historical record, the Galf of Akaba has at many periods been the
                        snocessful rival of the Gulf of Snez, being the principal waterway not only
                        for the fleets of Solomon and Ahab, but also of great importance to the
                        Crusaders and Saracens ; Akaba, at the head of the eastern gulf, being the
                        scene of many fierce fights, before Saladin finally obtained the mastery. As
                        Dean Stanley has given an eloquent account of these changes, in his work on
                        "Sinai and Palestine" the reader is referred to the latter for further
                        information. The peninsnla is administer, ed by the Intelligence Department
                        of the Egyptian War Office, the chief governient official in the peninsula
                        being the Commandant of Sinai, who resides at Kala'at el-Nakhi, there being
                        also a Nazir 1 at. Tor, though the latter town is practically controlled by
                        the Quarantine Board having its centre at Alexandria. The relations between
                        the Government and the tribesmen are negociated through the head sheikhs of
                        the peninsula, each separate tribe having also its own sheikh, who seems to
                        be invested with considerable authority. </p>
                    <p>The inhabitants of this mountainous region have fully maintained their good
                        reputation for honesty, readiness to oblige, and independence of character.
                        In general they are slight in build and somewhat short in stature, but very
                        active climbers and keen sportsmen. Even the children early learn to
                        recognize the plants and animals with which they come in contact, and the
                        necessity of finding water and camel-food brings them into close
                        acquaintance with every recess of their hills. Their | dwellings are of the
                        simplest description, consisting of dark or striped cloth stretched on a few
                        poles, and so placed as to be under the protection of some rocky ridge. A
                        partition in the centre divides them into quarters, the mens' from the
                        womens', while furniture is limited to camel-saddles, baskets for obtaining
                        camel-fodder, water-jars and a few other </p>
                    <p>primitive ntensils. 1 This new publication is excellent:y printed and is
                        illustrated with a number of beautiful views. Herr Guyot, of Helwan, kindly
                        I permitted the Survey Department to use his </p>

                    <p>AN IMPORTANT EXHIBITION. </p>
                    <p>By W. Sr. CHAD BOSCAWEN. </p>
                    <p>"Something attempted, something done, are the words that should be inseribed
                        over the entrance of the exhibition now being held by the Egypt Exploration
                        Hand at Kings College. This exhibition marks the completion of a most
                        important work, the exploration of the two grant temple of Hathor, under the
                        | cliffs of Deir El-Bahari-near Thebea. i For over fourteen years
                        (1892-1907) the Fund has been engaged in not only clearing the temples but
                        restoring the fallen soulptures where possible and this has entailed an
                        average expenditure of about £1,000 each season </p>
                    <p>Shortly before the completion of the great +Hathor Temple, built by Queen
                        Hatsbeper </p>
                    <p>in the eighteenth Dynasty, &amp; most im portant discovery was made by Profes
                        Bor &amp; Naville and Mr. H. R. Hall of the Bgyptian Department of the Bri
                        tish Museum, who was working with him, of <cb n="5"/> still older temple,
                        built by King Mentubetep II., called by the curious prenomen of Nebhateo-Ra,
                        "Lord of the Steering Paddle of Ra," &amp; king of the eleventh Dynasty,
                        abont B.C. 2500. It is from this temple that the antiquities now exhibited
                        at King's College come. The edifice was clearly the tomb-temple of the King,
                        and the curious stunted pyramid in the centre of the block was the sign of
                        the tomb. The four years' work upon the site has now completed the
                        exploration of one of the most remarkable buildings in Egypt. A great royal
                        tomb was discovered, the entrance passage to which was hewn five hundred
                        feet in the moun-1. tain, and at the end was a splendid chamber lined with
                        granite and alabaster. No coffin was found, but a huge alabaster 'naos" of
                        honey alabaster, twelve feet high and ten feet wide, with red granite beams
                        to support the roof, was found. The tomb had been plundered, and the burial
                        disturbed, but mach of the furniture was found, and is here, exhibited on
                        Table E. Alabaster canoptio vases with wooden lids, statues of officials and
                        servants, little wooden figures beautifully carved, bows of curious wood,
                        probably from Punt, arrows, staffs of offence, from which the gold plating
                        had been stripped, and portions of a human skall and bones (but these
                        Professor Naville regards as remains of a later burial) were also found.
                        Near here are some fine funeral boats, one with complete crew, figures, of
                        soldiers, servants, bakers, and brewers from the tombs of the princesses. </p>
                    <p>The most interesting exhibits here are the coloured bas reliefs from the
                        walls of the colonnade round the pyramid. This work is entirely new, and
                        shows that the art of the Eleventh Dynasty was a renasance of the old art
                        then considerably improved. Its principal featare, is high relief with
                        minute attention to detail-as note the portrait of the King and Queen (Table
                        B. 4), or the figure </p>
                    <p>of a priesters (C7), and the fine figures of I priestesses (C 11). Especially
                        fine in finish is </p>
                    <p>the unfortunately broken group of the King holding the hand of the Queen (C
                        12). The modelling of the limbs is most accurate, and this is very
                        important, for we have here, in | all probability, the work of the
                        celebrated painter-sculptor Mertisen, and his son who says on his
                        townb-stone, I know the right drawing of a hard or &amp; foot, the action of
                        one walking." For a striking example of the work of this school is a slab
                        representing the King standing with Hathor behind him. The modelling of the
                        figures, and the brillance of colour, and the finish of the bieroglyphs,
                        each of them a miniature portrait, mark them as the work of true artists. Of
                        war there is little illustration, only some scenes representing a war
                        against the Amo, or "people of Sinai," and here the ethnic features are well
                        preserved. It must be remembered that this year's work was a clear </p>
                    <p>ing-up of the rubbish heaps ; 80 many of the | exhibits are small, but the
                        beauty of the work </p>
                    <p>is preserved. Sinall exhibits are well worth attention. Blocks from the
                        pavement on which pilgrims (B.C. 2400 have outlined their sandals and then
                        scratched their names, i.e., Meri and Huy, on the sole. Such mementoes are
                        often </p>
                    <p>found on the lead roofs of our churches. The | blue glazed wire is very fine.
                        There are figures of the sacred cow of Hathor in painted limestone. This
                        blne glazed ware was frequently dedicated to Hathor, as the goddess of the
                        turquoise. The collection of workmen's toots, &amp;c., mallets, hoes, malls,
                        mats, and brushes for the sculptors to clear away dust are exhibited, as
                        well as some fine basket work. About the time of the twentieth dynasty this
                        temple appears to have been given over to the quarrymen, who broke the
                        sculptures and even drilled holes in the octagon columns of the colonnade to
                        cut them down, hence, the destruction. It is these workmen (1) to whom the
                        tools belong. The whole exhibition is full of interest and should well ropay
                        a visit. There will be lectures on "Exploration of the Temple, "by Mr.
                        Conelly, also on the Batodus," and by Mr. H. R. Hall on "Thebes." The
                        exhibition remains open a month. ("The Globe.") monu </p>
