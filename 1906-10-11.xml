                    <head>THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>We do not sahre the opinions of the "Daily Express" and the "Evening Standard
                        and St. James' Gazette," which have given us a very pretty and inspirting
                        picture of picked companies of the Army of Occupation sleeping in their
                        boots, clasping their rifles to their bosoms, and enduring the weight of 250
                        rounds og ballcartridege. As the pouches now worn by the British soldier do
                        not carry more than 100 rounds, we may be excused for displaying a certain
                        scepticism as to the military knowledge of our contemporary's informant. As
                        for his statement that seditious lanauge and anti British harangues can be
                        heard at a certain night-school we imagine that they can be heard at most of
                        the higehr students' debating clubs and in numerous bars where a certain
                        type of "Europeanised" Moslem congregates.</p>
                    <p>One may also study the workings of the "Nationalist" mind by studying the
                        outpourings of Mustapha Psha Kamel and many others, and the conclusion that
                        there is considerable unrest among the talkative classes isalmost capavle of
                        mathematical demonstration. Further, we believe that a certain number of
                        ulema have harangued the faithfyl in a style more suited to field preachers
                        than 60 religious dinitaries, and its is quite possible to work up a very
                        pretty theory of a vast conspiracy to undo the work that Great Britain has
                        accomplished since 1882. Fortunately there is alarge element - less
                        articulate perhaps than the loquacious gentlemen with pointed boots and the
                        latest thing in ties who pass such vigorous resolution and talk so gaily of
                        regenerating Egypt by themselves, and less in touch with the externals of
                        European civilisation - which has a very shrewd notion of its intersts, and
                        appreciates the ideas of tolerance and justic far more thoroughly than some
                        of the products of our secondary schools. Among this class may be reckoned
                        the great majority of the fellaheen, the mercantile class, and most of the
                        large propvincial land owners. We quite grant that some of the latter,
                        perhaps some of the merchants, would prefer, in theory, to see the Egyptian
                        governing themselves. We do not blame them for their feelings. We realise
                        that in practice they prefer to leave well aone and trust to the increase of
                        education and the growth of the civic virtues among Egyptian to bring about
                        that consummation at long last. As for the fellaheen - with the exception
                        perhaps of some of the Menoufieh people - they want water and justice -
                        voila tout. In time their wants may be extended to platforms and ballot
                        boxes, but that time has not yet come, and for the present these fellaheen -
                        five-sixths of the population of Egypt - desire to be allowed to ass piastre
                        to piastre, die, and pray in their own fashion.</p>
                    <p>As for our agitators - apostles in the open or in secret of the gospel of
                        Yildiz - they have a certain following of whom exist in Egypt as in most
                        Moslem and christian countries, imposters, partisans of reaction, and
                        idealists who image that the millenium will come if every Effendi has a
                        votes, hangers on of the court and men "on the make" who - realising that
                        "Nationalism" and anglophobia are in great demand just now hasten to supply
                        the consumer with great pleasure and profit to themselves. There are also
                        some real patriots who idealism has obscured their common sense, who follow
                        the "Lewa" and till lately helped to give Mustapha Psha Kamel an excellent
                        reclame that their guide is so fond of heading the procession that he has
                        led them many weary miles rfom their goal: but that is their affair. We can
                        only condole and wish them a better choice.</p>
                    <p>With such materials at the disposal of the Nationalist party we need not be
                        afraid of any really serious trouble. A few of our cafe haunting Beys may be
                        rudes than usual to unprotected European ladies - a subject to which we will
                        revert later. A few students may incite their friends to go on strike, to
                        the great detriment of their careers, and there will be quantities of what
                        Sir Syed Ahmed Khan described as buk-buk0buk and giz-giz-giz (scratching of
                        a reed pen) but that will be all, in our opinion. We admit we are no more
                        infallible than Old Moore or the illustrious Zadkiel, and that the proverb
                        ex Africa semper aliquic nour may be proved true in our case. Still we hold
                        by our opinion, fortified by the certainity that it represents the view of
                        many of our readers and recommend the doubters to find a mental station half
                        way between the pesimism of a Cassandra and the optimism of the ill starred
                        Pangloss.</p>

                            <p>The Foreign Office has published the full summary of the modus

                                Great Britain undertakes not to enfore the law recently passed by
                                the Newfoundland Legislature, aimed expressly at preventing American
                                fishermen from profiting by local advantages. She also counsents to
                                the Americans using purse and seins, to which the Newfoundlanders
                                particularly object. America agrees that no fishing will take place
                                on Sundaus in order to confrom with certain colonial regulations.She
                                also understakes to ship no Newfoundlanders for work on American

                                Newfoundlanders is wholly unassuaged by the publication of the
                                modusvivendi. The Imperial Government is accused of trampling on
                                colonial rights. The colony has resolved to make use of every means
                                to impede American fisherman. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>THE KHEDIVE'S VISIT.</p>
                    <p>(FROM THE OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Tantah is agog with excitement. For the first time in the history of the
                        Khedivial Agricultral Society tht annual Show is bein gheld at Tantah,
                        though I am told that some forty-five years ago a similar exhibition, on a
                        smaller scle, was held here under other suspices. The civil world in engala,
                        and has foresaken work to participate in the town's rejoincing; offical-dom
                        , overwhelmed with the resonsibility, is fused end worried lest any hitch
                        should occur. The organisation, however, of the day's proceedings appears to
                        guarantee that everything will go well, for, as far as the layman can judge,
                        no detail had been imperfectly arranged.</p>
                    <p>The decoations exlipse all previous efforts for the many mouleds that this
                        town has seen, and everything is ready to give a fitting welcome to his
                        Highness the Khedive. The tow main platforms of the station are a blaze of
                        red with the numberless O: to man banners, which surround shields on which
                        are inscribed in golden letters the Khedivial monogram, topped by a crown.
                        Opposite the exit the pillars are draped with the heavy satyer curtains and
                        at the approach to the station triumphal arches decked in red, green, and
                        white have been erected. The streets are lined on either sie with lofty
                        poles bound in red and white cloth and surmounted by the star and crescent
                        and at the corner of the road leading to the show ground there is another
                        triumphal arch.</p>
                    <p>A large area, formerly given over the refuse, to the noth east of the station
                        and in front of the Government schools has been converted into an excellent
                        and well arranged show ground. Close to the entrance are the marwuees for
                        the Khedive, the committee, and the Khedivial luncheon. Long tents have been
                        pitched for the cotton and grain exhibits, the native industries are to be
                        seen in temporary wooden shops, and the animals ranging from camels to
                        guinea-pigs are well arranged according to class. The committee in composed
                        of six members: Mohamed Bey Abou el Izz. Ibrahim Bey Bahgat, Hamid Effendi
                        Ismail Aamir, Mohamed Bey el Sherif, Ahmed Bey el Sheikh, and Hafiz Bey el
                        Menshawi, with Mohamed Effendi Huussein as secretary, under the presidency
                        of Hassan Pasha Radwan, Moudir of Gharbieh. Great credit is due to this
                        committee and to Mr.G Foaden and the staff of the Khedivial Agricultural
                        Society for the excellent manner in which all the details have been
                        arranged.</p>
                    <p>First among the exhibits comes the cotton which is arranged in two tents one
                        of which is devoted to Mit Afifi and the second to Abbassi and Yanovitch.
                        The cotton is exhibited both as it comes from the bolls and ginned and the
                        seeds are also on show and we are glad to note that it is distincly superior
                        in quality to that of last year. The grains, too, are well represented and
                        fully up to standard.</p>
                    <p>Great interest is attached to the exhibitation of the Prison Department,
                        which shows many examples of the various articles produced by the industrial
                        section. Carriage harness was exceptionally fine work and quite equal to
                        European products. Dogcart harness was shown of that class most in demand in
                        Egypt. The cart harness also appeared to us of a durable manufacture; the
                        sample shown was in brown leather, very strongly made for town and municipal
                        work. Doormats, cocoa nut matting, carpets, and various examples of weaving,
                        together with good workmanship in carpenters, crafts, were features of the
                        exhibition. A very wide selection of brushes was on view from bott brushes
                        to sweet sweepers; these all show a perfection in the insutrial department
                        we had not anticipated. Wood turning in the way of walking sticks, fly
                        whisks, and sundry articles of the same material were in evidence. These
                        include ivory, hippo-horn, and bone. I can readily congratulate and
                        workmanship of the articles manufactured.</p>
                    <p>Large crowds lined the streets at the hour for the arrival of the Khedivial
                        train approached and every point of vantage was seized upon. The troops
                        which arrived early this morning by special train and which number 50
                        cavalry and 150 infantry are lining the Sikka el Ghedidah and everybody was
                        on the tip-toe of expectation. The telegraph staff is kept busy by a crowd
                        of journalists.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivial train drw up at the main platform punctually at a quarter to
                        eleve, and his Highness, who was accompanied by the ministers, Ahmed Ghali
                        Pasha, Yusef Ria Pasha Mustapha Ibadi Pasha, Mohamed Izzat Bey, and Ahmed
                        Shefik Bey, was greeted by Princes Hassein Pasha Kamel, Omar Pasha Toussoum,
                        Said Pasha Hadid, the President of the Native Tribunal, the Coptic, Greek,
                        and Maronite priests of Tantah, and the chiefs of the various
                        administrations. As the train drew up a salute of 21 guns was fired and the
                        band played the Khedivial Anthem.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive first drove along the Sikka el Ghedida, preceded to the Show
                        ground, where he held a reception, which was attended by the ulma officals
                        of the grade of mirmivan, and the vice consuls of the town. After this
                        reception his Highness inspected with interest the many and varied exhibits
                        and at the time of wiring, the luncheon, to which 114 guests have been
                        invited, is being held. After lunch the Khedive will hold another reception
                        for officals of the rank of moutesiz and sanieh, and officers of the rank of
                        bimbashi and up wards, ahe will leave for Cairo at 3.5 p.m.</p>
                    <p>The streets are almost impassible and the excitement of the natives is
                        intense.</p>

                        CHRISTIANS.</head>
                    <p>It is unfortunate that at the very beginings of the scheme of the new
                        national univesity the lists of subscriptions, as announced in the
                        vernacular Press, should have been found to be in great measure fictitions
                        and the vast donations that have been ascribed to many native notables are
                        being repudiated. It appears that the native journalist's idea of an
                        excellent practical joke is to publish announcements that such and such
                        Moslem grandee has promised an enormous sum of money for the univeristy,
                        although no such undertaking had ever given many of the victims will not
                        have the moral courage to repudiate these fictitous tributes to their
                        generous enthusiasm for the scheme. This method of swelling the subscription
                        list has no doubt some efficacy, but many of the victims are protesting. For
                        instance "Al Minbar" published a special edition a few days ago in order to
                        tell the world that Aly Pasha Fehmy, a former engineer in the Irrgiation
                        Department, whose only child, a daughter, is married to Prince Fadel, had
                        understaken to subscribe £100,000 to the Unveristy. Enormous publicity was
                        given to this alleged generosity of the Pasha, but his Excellency
                        contradicted the announcement of "Al Minbar" in the columns of "Al
                        Lews."</p>
                    <p>There are many other instances, Mohamed Effendi Bazera, whose name appears on
                        the list of the subscribers to the University, writes to inform "Al Lews"
                        that he has been the victim of a practical joke and has not subscribed a
                        pistre. "Al Mokattam" states that it has received a letter bearing the
                        signature of the wakil of Ahmed Bey Cherif stating that the report that his
                        employer had presented L.E. 10,000 and 100 feddans is absolutely unfourned.
                        Nobody knows who has actually subscribed.</p>
                    <p>"Al Watan" remarls: - Questions have been asked as to the reason of the
                        abstention of the Copts from subscribing to the proposed University. We
                        believe that as a mater of fact, they are merly waiting for the formation of
                        the Committee and the elaboration of a programme. We have no doubts as to
                        their generosity.</p>
                    <p>"Al Ahram" also states that a number of Syrian notables have met and decided
                        to combine to forward the total of their subscriptions to the University
                        Committee, when formed.</p>
                    <p>Our contemporary adds: "We learn that many Europeans habe also decided to
                        open their purses in aid of the subscription."</p>

                        friends of the battalion, military and civilian.</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Battalion is the junior one of that destinguished regiment. It was
                        added to tit less than a decade ago, when a Government was in power which
                        had some respect for Imperial intersts, and preferred to sacrific power
                        rather than uield to popular clap-trap. We need hardly say that the
                        Coldstream Guards have a reputation second to none in the British Army both
                        in peace and war, and their prowess on the field is amply attested to by the
                        long roll of honours which adorns the folds of the regimental colours -
                        Oudenarde, Malplaquet, Dettingen, Lincelles, Talavera, Barroa, Penisula,
                        Waterloo, alma, Inkerman, Sebastopol, Egypt three times already in their
                        history.</p>
                    <p>The regiment came in to existence at the Restoration of 1660. It is a matter
                        of history how General Monk marched from the border village of Coldstream to
                        put Charles II. on the throne of Grea Britian, an din commemoration of that
                        circumstance the regiment which partly formed his force was subsequently
                        styled the Coldstream Guards. As a matter of fact the regiment had been in
                        existence from 1650 as part of the Comwellian army. The regiment, and the
                        Royal Horse Guards (Blues) are the only regiments now in existence that were
                        in Cromwell's army. The Coldstreamers saw a good deal of service in the
                        reign of Charles II and his unfortune brother James II. At the Revolution
                        the regiment went over the popular side, disgusted with the treachery, and
                        unkingly conduct of the last of the Stuarts.</p>
                    <p>Under King William the Coldstream Regiment served in the Flanders Campaign.
                        It was Caidz and Vigo, at the beginning of the war of the Spanish
                        Succession. Some companies were among the succour thrown into Gibraltar
                        after its capture by Rooke; and subsequently served in Spain, under Galway
                        and Peterborough, and at the battle of Alamanza. The regiment was not in
                        Marlborough's earlier campaing; but in 1708, four companies (afterwards
                        increased to six) formed in battalion with some companies of the first
                        Guards, were sent to Flanders, and worthily represented the regiment at the
                        great victories of Ocdenarde and Malplaquet, and at many sieges and
                        encounters - including the capture of the Standard of the French Guards at
                        Neer Landendown, to the peace of 1713 when they returned home from Dunkirk.
                        The regiment took part in the Vigo Expadition of 1719.</p>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion fought at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and was in Scotland
                        during the Rebellion of 1745. The 2nd battalion was at the seige of
                        Bergen-op-zoom two years later, served on the French coast in 1757 and
                        afterwards served in the campaign of 1760 in Germany, under the Marquis of
                        Granby. The regiment contributed its quota to the contingent of Guards which
                        served in America down to the surrender at York Town.</p>
                    <p>At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War the 1st Battalion embarked
                        with the brigade of guards under Lake. It fought at St. Amand, near Famers,
                        on the 9th May 1793, one of the first encounters of the enmey , when the
                        brunt fell on the Steramers, who behaved with a spirit nothing could exceed.
                        They fought at Lincelles, and in many other affairs in the subsequent war,
                        and shared in the winter retreat to Breman. The regiment was represented in
                        Ireland, and at Ostend in 1798 and in North Holland in 1799. The 1st
                        Battalion served under Sir J. M. PUlteney, at Ferrol and Vigo, and
                        eventually Sir Ralph Abercromby's forces in Marmorice Bay, and accompanied
                        them to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>At the landing of the British I Aboukir Bay, the Coldstreams waded ashore in
                        heavy marchin gorder, under a tremendous cannonade, from which they suffered
                        heavily, losing more men than all the rest of the force put together. They
                        participated in the battle of Alexandri a21st March, 1801, where the gallant
                        Abercrombie fell in the moment of victory, and in the subsequent siege of
                        Alexandria they bore a prominent part and after the surrender of the French
                        garrison, forme dpart of the force ordered to occupy the city. The battalion
                        left Egypt immendiately afterwards, and after a delay of three weeks in
                        Malta, returned home. Its services in egypt are symbolized by the "Schinx."
                        with the word "Egypt" on the regimental colours of all three battalions.</p>
                    <p>The 1st battalion served in the expedition to Hanover in 1805, and at
                        Copehagen in 1807. Its embarked for the TAgus, under command of General
                        Sherbrooks, in January, 1809, and subsequently served at the passage of
                        the</p>

                    <p>Douro, the capture of Oporto, and the battles of Talavera and Barossa, also
                        in the subsequent campaigns of 1810, including the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo,
                        Badejos, Burogs, and St. Sebastian the battles of Fuentes d'Onor,
                        Salamances, Vittoria, Pyrenees, bidossoa, Nive, Nivelle, and the investment
                        of Bayonne and up to the walls of Paris.</p>
                    <p>The flank companies of the 2nd Battalion were in the Walcheren Expedition and
                        some companies of the same Battalion served under Graham at Cadiz, and at
                        the battle of BArossa. These companies aftwards returned home. In 1813, six
                        companies of the 2nd Battalion proceeded to Holland, and took . part I the
                        assult on Bergen-op-Zoom. these companies remained in garrison in Belgium
                        after the peace being quated at Brussels, and then at Ath. On the eascape of
                        Napolen from Elba they were reinforced from home by four more companies of
                        the 1st Battalion, and represented the regiment at the battles of Quatre
                        Bras and Waterloo. The 2nd Battalions of the Coldstreams and 3rd (now Scots)
                        Guards, formed the second Brigade of Guards, commanded by Sir JOhn Byng. On
                        the 18th June, the Second Brigade of Guards was posted on the ridge above
                        Hougoment, on the right side of Maitlan'ds Guards, and to part of the
                        Coldstream battalion tell the honour of defending the Chateu of Hougomount -
                        the key of the british position - throughout that memorable day. The
                        Battalion took part in the occupation of Paris remaining in France until the
                        summer of 1816.</p>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion was in Portugal in 1897 28, and the 2nd Battalion was in
                        Canada during the disturbances of 1838. It was about this time that King
                        William IV. ordered the regiment to adopt the bearskin, which had only been
                        worn previously by the Grenadier companies.</p>
                    <p>At the outbreak of the Crimean War, the 1st Battalion embarked for the East
                        with the Duke of Cambridge's division, with which it served in the battles
                        of the Alma, and Inkerman and in the siege of Sebastopol, in all of which it
                        covered itself with glory, particulary in the "Soldiers' Battle" of that
                        memorable 5th Novemeber, 1834.</p>
                    <p>The Coldstreamers were not called upon to take the field again till the
                        Egyptian War of 1882, when the 1st Battalion went out and fought in various
                        actions, and went over the trenches of Tel el-Kebir. The 2nd Battalion was
                        also engaged in the Suskin Expedition of 1885, and both battalions supplied
                        detachedments to the Canal Corps operating with the columns attempting to
                        bring succour to Gordon in Khartoom.</p>
                    <p>During the late South Africa War the 1st and 2nd Battalions represented the
                        regiment, and the prowess of the Guards in may a stubborn action is yet too
                        fresh in the public mind to dilate upon here. Suffice it to say that the
                        Coldstreamers of the present day proved that they were worthy successors to
                        the dead and gone heroes whose bones whitened the plains and hills of Europe
                        in the days of Marlborough and Wellington, or lie in the valles before
                        Skastopol. As already announced in these notes, the 3rd Coldstreamers are
                        earmarked for reduction under Mr. Halden's scheme, but something occuring in
                        the political world may save it. It is to be hoped so in the interests of
                        the army. </p>

                        <p>Lancashire cotton psinners have given other instance of their enterprise.
                            It is reported that syndicate has bought a tract of land in Brownwill,
                            Texas, to the extent of 4,000 acres, in order to cultivate the growth of
                            cotton. For a number of years English spinners have been looking about
                            for a suitable place to grow raw material believing that the cost would
                            be thereby reduced. A few months ago several Manchester employers
                            visited the cotton belt and mada careful inquiry into the culture of
                            cotton. More land is inteded to be bought if the present experiment

                        <p>Sir, - Will you allow me in your valuable columns to draw the attention
                            of these responsible, and irresponsible, to the harm that is done to
                            Egypt by the publisation senational news as cultivated by the present
                            day correspondent. Upon one or two facts of slight importance, are built
                            the most monstrous fabrications. They are easily wrecked by the first
                            puff of truth, but unhappliy the public aborad may only read the first
                            sotry, and miss the categorial denial. The result is that people of
                            nervous temperament are actually frightened away. Why only the other day
                            an oldy lady wrote to me, anxiously enquiring whether there was any
                            "Unrest in Egypt" before she would start for Assouan. Surely some
                            measure ought to be adopted for occasionally muzzling news mongers of
                            these higly flavoroued wares, if only for the sake of these whose
                            livelihood depoends on the tourist. - Yours, etc.</p>

                        <p>Sir, - There is hardly a corner of the busiest thoroughfares in Ciaro
                            where is not to be found a cafe with seats and tables in front, which
                            not alone fill up the footway but in some instances extend partly across
                            the road. This greatly adds to the dangers of pedstrians, as likewise
                            the sticky state of the freshly watered roads, which are brushed but
                            never scraped, as they ought to be. The flith consequently gets chavned
                            up by the traffic, and crossing the road without stumbling is a matter
                            of great difficulty. The roads, too, ought to be watered with a mixture
                            of Jaye's Fluid. the odour from the moist filth is most offensive and
                            harmful to health and comfor. - Yours truly,</p>

                        Sconto, aux Nungovich Hotels, Delta Land, Estates, Comptoir et Hooker.
                        Ajoutons que les banques en general et particulierement l'Agricole et la
                        National Bank sont provisoire ment delaissees.</p>
                    <p>La Cassa di Sconto s'avance de 228 a 229 ¼ l'ancienne et la nouvelle de 222 ½

                        vennes d'Europe, ne peut guere s'expliquer que par l'ouverture annulle de la

                            <p>Great general interst has been excited by the publication of the
                                diary of the former Chancello, Prince Hohenlohe, comprising the
                                narration of the Emperor William's own description to the Prince of
                                the three deplorable weeks preceeding Prince Bismarck's downfall. He
                                mentions various heated discussion on labour questions which took
                                place between the Emperor and the Prince. The final separation was
                                largely due to the Emperor's refusal to countenance Prince
                                Bismarck's policy of favouring Russia to the detriment of Germany's
                                Austrian ally. The Emperor told Prince Hohenlohe that is the final
                                itnerview Dismarck enarly threw the ink-pot at him. It was generally
                                concluded that the publication of the diary at the present moment
                                was due tot he Emperor's desire to propitiate Austria by testifying
                                to his old loyalty to the alliance, but His Majesty yesterday
                                telegraphed to the head of the House of Hohenlohe condemning to the
                                publication as arrant and tactless. (Reuter)</p>

                                regarless of a particular system. The British postal delegates were
                                willing to waive the opposition, but the Admiralty feel bound by the

                    <head>EGYPT'S FUTURE.</head>
                    <head>"QUITE INNOCUOUS."</head>
                    <p>Mr. Robert William, F.R.I.B.A, a well known Lodon architect, has for some
                        time been in the habit of spending a considrable part of every year in
                        Egypt, where he has extensive professional interests. He is keenly
                        interested in Egypt and the Egyptians and is much impressed by the
                        industrial and commerical potentialities of the ancient land, which owes its
                        marvellous regeneration in these latter days to the guiding hand and
                        protecting arm of England.</p>
                    <p>"I am not a all perturbed," said Mr. Williams to a "Daily Chronicle"
                        representative, by the talk of a vast Pan-Islamic agitation. Pan-Islamism is
                        an innocuous as Pan-Celticism. The idea that Moslem is a fantic is
                        fallacious. I have mized with all classes of the Egyptians; have travelled
                        alone for hundreds of miles through the country, and have never been
                        subjected to the slightest annoyance.</p>
                    <p>"You ask me if the people are grateful for the blessings of justic, orderly
                        government, and prosperity which have followed in the wake of the British
                        occupation. Yes; I think they are. But just now there is a very bitter
                        feeling of resentment against the British for the haste and the severity of
                        the punishments in the DEnishwai affairs. That has left burning mermories.
                        Nobody can deny that the British have helped the Egyptians and have done
                        marvellous things in the apst twenty four years in the interest of Egypt.
                        The country enhoys considerable prosperity, although there is a great deal
                        yet to be done to develop its industrial potentialities. As an instance of
                        the prosperity of Egypt I may tell you from personal knowledge that at the
                        present timeland in Alexandria fetches from £50,000 to £60,000 an acre. Land
                        values, urban and rural, have greatly appreciated in recent years. It is
                        unfortunate that this rapid development attracts the gambler and dubious
                        company promoter. As the Egyptian himself is a born gambler, these parasites
                        of commerce find in Egypt a congenial field.</p>
                    <p>The Nationalist Movement.</p>
                    <p>"As to the Nationalist novement. I do not thnk it has, as yet, taken definite
                        form. The better educated people undoubtedly demand a voice in the
                        government of the country. Their favourite is, 'Give us a Parliament like
                        the British House of Common.' Yet they have crude ideas of Parliamentary
                        instituations. Not long ago I had a talk with a typical Egyptian of the
                        educated class."</p>
                    <p>"We want a Parliament of our own," he told me, "modelled on your."</p>
                    <p>"Do you want a House of Lords" I asked. </p>
                    <p>"No, no," was the reply.</p>
                    <p>"Do you want manhood suffrage"</p>
                    <p>"Certanily not. We would confine the vote to landowners, master craftsmen,
                        shopkeepers, and resident Europeans."</p>
                    <p>"What about the workers. Would you not give them the vote"</p>
                    <p>"No; they are too ignorant."</p>
                    <p>"Would you give the vote to women"</p>
                    <p>"indeed, no; the woman's place is the house, to mind the children and bake
                        the bread."</p>
                    <p>Moslem Fanaticism.</p>
                    <p>"You will see from this fragment of conversation that the educated Egyptian
                        has crude ideas of democracy."</p>
                    <p>"Egypt has many acute social problems confronting her at the present time. In
                        the towns there is a housing problem, and there are other gross social
                        evils. The difficulty of dealing with these is aggravated by the
                        indifference and the fatalism of the Oriental. There is no sustained or
                        widely-diffused interest in politics.</p>
                    <p>The fame of the wealth of Lower Egypt having penetrated into Upper Egypt and
                        the Sudan, an influx of Berberin and Sudansese has been the natural
                        consequence. Many of these are lump hobbledehoys, who manage to live on the
                        barest fare, lodging in any odd corners. They are hardy sons of the soil,
                        and need neither bed nor covering. To them and their like (for the want of
                        something better on which to expand their strength) together with the
                        Alexandrian shoeblack, was due the riot of last Christmas, but which was
                        intially provoke dby two gambling Greeks and their evolvers.</p>
                    <p>The municipality of Alexandria are now endeavouring to induce the surplus
                        Berberin, etc., to return to their own country, on the upper reaches of the
                        Nile where they can always find cultivating work to do, often on their own
                        bit of land.</p>
                    <p>Don't believe in all this talk of Moslem fanaticism. It's a mere scare. The
                        religion of Islam is perhaps the most democratic in the world, and in time
                        it may develop in those who profess it the idea of the brotherhood of man,
                        which underlies it, alon ght lines of Socialism.</p>
                    <p>To help the Arabs we can do much if each one of us were to remember that the
                        Egyptian judges of our country and intentions by what he sees in us
                        individually. As our actions are noble or ignoble so will be judge of the
                        nation to which it is our privilege to belong. At one time the Arbas used to
                        say that a thing was as true "as the word of an Englishman." It behoves us
                        to live up to this noble tradition.</p>
                    <p>"Let England help the Egyptians to develop the great underdeveloped resources
                        of the country; let her help to check the ravages of the money-lender and
                        exploiter; let her help the Egyptian to a complete system of elementary,
                        technical, and higher education; let her help gradually, but surely, to pave
                        the way to self-government. Then we shall crown the beneficent work we have
                        done in Egypt."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Williams had much to say on the architecture of Egypt past and present.
                        The Egyptians have deteriorated in this great art of which hygone centuries
                        they were the leaders of the world. "I am doing what I can," he said, in my
                        own sphere to induce the egyptian builders to use those splendid materials
                        which the ancient Egyptians employed with such marvellous results in their
                        temples and pyramids. These materials still abound in the country. At
                        Assouan there is an unlimited supply of beautiful granite, both red and
                        grey, as well as diorite. Then at Silsillah ther are vast sandstone
                        quarries, and at Bassatin there is some excellent limestone. All this fine
                        material is left unused, and in its place the builders of today use much
                        inferior stone and brick without anything like its beauty or its lasting
                        power."</p>

                    <byline>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT)</byline>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>There is a general feeling that great credit is due to the Directors of the
                        Bank of England in declining to be anxious in face of the further heavey
                        withdrawls of gold that have taken place during the week. It would be a good
                        thing if the financial community generally took a lesson from their
                        hard-headed common-sense, for, reviewing the situation ina dispaasionate
                        manner, there is no reason for any anxiety as regards the money market at
                        present, nor is there likely to be so far as common sense can reason it out.
                        The American demand has come and gone, and not withstanding this being a
                        heavy drain the proportion of reserve is ony 1.8 below that of last year. At
                        the same time the accumulations in the Treasury at New York, and the
                        untouched positions of the reserves in France, are an usually strong piont.
                        that these should be kept to a certain extent in reserve, after all, makes
                        for steadiness, and the drop in the price of gold is an unmistakable sign
                        that the supply is overtaking the demand. The unknown factor for the moment
                        in Egypt, and it is not supposed that the crop there can be moved without
                        several millions being withdrawn. These withdrawls, however, are likely to
                        be counter-balanced by supplies from the mines, whjich will be redirected to
                        this country now that the demand from America has eased off. It is not
                        possible to foretell with any certainty, but the general feeling here is
                        that the corner has been turned, and that the crisis, if such it can be
                        called, is passed.</p>
                    <p>It is very encouraging to see in a report made by the Committee of
                        Investigation in the United States on the currency question a very sensible
                        suggestion for the establishment of an Issue Bank under control not
                        connected with the Government and mainly a bankers' bank. This departue is
                        as nearly as possible a copy of our own excellent system, excepting that the
                        Bank of Issue, as we understand it, will not take ordinary business to
                        compete with the other banks and will be more under Government control. That
                        some means was necessary to put the note issue in America on a more elastic
                        basis is admitted by all. A state bank would appear to be not only good and
                        practicable, but on the lines of the least resistance.</p>
                    <p>The Bank return this week shows a reduction of reserve amounting to
                        £2,979,000, and the decline in the ratio of the reserve to liabilities is 4
                        3/8 percent., which, however, is only 1/8 percent less than at this time
                        last year.</p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>Although there has again been a certain amount of nervousness - uncessary
                        nervousness, we think - regardin the money position, the undertone has been
                        decidely good since our last, and we are informed by the most prominent
                        brokers on the Stock Exchange that there was more steady buying this week
                        than for months past, more for investment than speculation. Should the money
                        market show increased ease, as we have a right to expect, it is higly
                        probable that the activity in stocks will be largely enhanced. In some
                        quarters ther was an inclinatino to criticise the Bank Directors, but the
                        general feeling now ist hat they are best able to gauge the future of money,
                        to 5 per cent was a wise one. Certainlu as regard the stock markets this
                        decision has had a good effect, espcially on first-class stocks, and there
                        is no reason to doubt that in the rear future, with a normal money position,
                        we shall see a really substantial revivial of acitivy. This is a desideratum
                        that has long been looked ofr, and dealers have almost grown weary of
                        waiting for it, but this week they have received some encouragement, which
                        is accepted as omen of better things to come.</p>
                    <p>Consols.</p>
                    <p>The Consol settlement has been effected this week, and the carry over price
                        showed a loss of a full point on the account, the compartive quotations
                        being 87 3/8 last time, and 86 3/8 on Wednesday.</p>
                    <p>Business in the gilt edged market has again been influenced by the heavy go
                        with drawals from Threadneedle Stree, and anticipation of a further increase
                        in the Bank rate. on the announcement of no change yesterday the prce of
                        Consols improved to 86 ¾, but fell back to 86 5/8, and closed unchanged on
                        the day.They leave off tonight at 86 ½.</p>

                        appear in this mornings newspapers regarding the very grave condition of
                        Russian finances, and the absolute necessity for another loan being floated
                        to meet the heavy deficit on the year's working have, however, caused a set
                        back, and the bonds close weak, the Four at 72 ¼ and the new loan at 10 ¼
                        discount. Japanese Four and a Half per cents were in active demand
                        yesterday, the price gaining 1/8 at 95 ½, at which they close tonight. The
                        weakness of Turks is a prominent feature of the market, the Unified
                        yesterday losing 3/6 at 93 ½ Ottoman Banks also dropped to ¼ to 16 3/8.</p>

                        report last week, dearer money, and relisations by stale bulls reduced this
                        market to a helpless condition. The low prices touched, however, brought in
                        some buying orders and this gave an improved appearnce, which was enhanced
                        by the retention of the Bank rate 4 1/2%. Great Northern Deferred were very
                        depressed at one time, the price being forced down to 40 1/8, the lowest
                        point touched during the year, and this in spite of a traffic increases of
                        over £6,000 The shares have since received some support, and close better at

                    <p>American railway shares maintained a firm tone for the two or three days this
                        week, but the disppointment felt at the Aitchison dividend at the rate of 5
                        per cent., which is 1 per cent less than had been anticipated, cast a gloom
                        over the market yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Aitchison shares were put down 4 ¼ points to 107 ¼, Chicago-milwaukee lost 1,
                        while in the most of the other cases there were losses from ¼ to 7/8.
                        Southern Pacifics were the only firm section, these gaining 1. The market
                        has been quiet today, and the changes are few and insignifant. Aitchison
                        have recovered 1/8, and Steels ¼, but Unions have lost 5/8, and Milwaunkee ½
                        Canadian Pacifics are 1 ¼ lower.</p>

                        During the early part of the week National Banks were dealt in to a
                        considerable extent, and at one time wer 27 buyers, but have since dropped
                        back to 26 ¾, at which price they leave off tonight. The new Land Bank issue
                        which is being offered to the public is not looked upon very favourably.
                        Before providing this corporation with a further sume of £1,800,00 it seems
                        desirable to enquire whether the security is ample, and whether it bears a
                        satisfactory relation to the moneys subscribed by the British public. Lands
                        Banks clsoe tonight at 9 which is the same as last Friday. New Egyptians
                        have again revived, quite a large number of the shares having changed hands.

                    <p>The South African market has been almost devoid of interest , and for the
                        greater part of the week there has been pratically nothing doing. In the
                        absence of support, shares dropped considerably, but yesterday towards the
                        close there was a little professional dealing in some of the shares. As a
                        result of this, Rand Mines, after being offered at 5 18/19, picked up to
                        buyers at 6, why Goldields recovered from sellers to buyers at 4 1/16 after
                        being sellers under the figure. In the Rhodesian section Tanagyikes hardened
                        to 6 ½ and Bankets to 2 1/8 Rand Mines leave off tonight at 6 and Tangayikes
                        at 6 9/16.</p>

                        to 1,19.32 last Friday, leave off tonight at 1,17/32. Nile Valleys after
                        being irregular show little change on the week at 6 3d.</p>

                    <p>American Futures.- The market this week has experienced an enormous business,
                        and a complete change of front. The "Bears," alarmed by a devastating
                        hurricane in the Southern States, the extent of damage resultinf from which
                        is still uncertain, although undoubtedly serious, rushed in to buy, and
                        prices rose over 50 points in 3 days; there has subsequently been a sharp
                        reaction of 20 points from the extreme rates touched yesterday afternoon
                        Closing valyes are, however, from the injury by storm the weather reports
                        generally are not considerable favourable, rains continue in most districts,
                        and ther is a decided tendency to more conseravative estimates of the yield.
                        We tink that great nervousness and constant flucutations, probably shapr
                        ones, will mark the immediate future, especially during the next 2 or 3
                        weeks, on account of the liabilit to frost scares, which would be
                        paraticularly disastrous this season, the plant being in a wet condition.
                        The market will require careful watching.We think that purchases mad ein
                        drpressed moments will be profitable, for we believe that all ideas of a
                        bumper yield, so confidently, and that the large requirements of consumers
                        will eventually bring about a higher level of prices.</p>
