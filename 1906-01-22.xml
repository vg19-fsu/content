                        powerfal party should have been possible. Here is (or was)</p>
                    <p>Government which had an enormons claim apon the gratitude of the country. How
                        is it that its majority of about 130 five years" ago-has been converted in a
                        short space of time into a minority of 261, with all the unpleasant
                        possibilities of the fature yet to come t We take it that the tras answer is
                        to be found not so much in Tariff Reform, the Education Act, the Licensing
                        Act, Chinese "Slavery," or in al these elements put together. We believe, on
                        the contrary, that neither one nor all of them would have sufficed to
                        unloose the floodgates of the electoral Heavenie "e of the spont was off the
                        Everlastin' Teapot." Beaten we might have been; but flattened out, as, we
                        are being, we should not have, been, if the Government had been able to read
                        the signs of the times, and had not committed what in polition, as in
                        society, is an anpardonable sin. In plain Boglish, Mr. Balfer outstayed his
                        welcome. Had he dissolved Parliament even as late a August last, after Lord
                        Lansdowne had made the second Anglo Japaness Agre went an accomplished fact,
                        this would not. have happened. If he had realised the frath that he was
                        losing the onfilence of.. the country, and losing it because the Govern
                        ment's work was doua,he would not have found himself in his present plight.
                        Instead of boldly appealing to the country on a record of achieve ments
                        which, on one side at least, was splendid, ho took his stand on bis
                        technical right to nocept no notion to quit exoept from the House of
                        Commons, be ignored the significance of the by-elections, and sat tight. It
                        was.a grievous blander, and his party is now paying the penalty-and paying
                        it at compound interest The dominant factor in the situation still remains
                        the Labour vote. The enormous polle that have been oast for the Labour

                        Lesda and Bradford. It is apparent that the "Conservative working man... in
                        the North, and in London, too, has been mainly inficenced in the past by his

                        political histery. The working classes have at last realised the power which
                        was conferred on them in 1885, It was the redistribution of seats in that
                        year,- moeh more than the equalisation of the borough, and conaty franchise,
                        which bit- ohased the révolution.. The creation of those vaat

                    <head>THE SAVOY DANCE.</head>
                    <p>Largely Attended</p>
                    <p>There were many new faces and frocks to be seen at the Savoy on Saturday
                        night, and the ball-rOom was even fuller than it has ever been at the
                        preceding dances. At times it was almost impossible to get round the room,
                        and equally difficult it is now to remember all those who were present. The
                        dresses worn were really delightful, so fresh and pretty and all of the very
                        latest types. it would be invidious to say who was the best-dressel Woman in
                        the room, but certainly nothing could have been more graceful and becoming
                        than the lovely frock of Coarse lace embroidered with narrow ribbon, which
                        was worn over a pale blue chiffoo underdress. The wide cape collar was of a
                        very coarse lace edged with multiple rows of Valenciennes,and the wearer had
                        an ornament of sparkling tissue on her well coiffed head. Then again a very
                        handsome dark woman was wearing a severely out satin of deep rose, one side
                        of the long tunic in front being em­broidered with velvet appliques ot the
                        same shade the velvet appliques lightly spangled appeared upon the light net
                        draperies of the decolletage. A young fair girl had on an ideal frock qf
                        silk muslin with tiny groups of helio trope flowers upon it. There were
                        ribbon-edged frills at both neck and hem, and the deep corselet was of the
                        same colour.</p>
                    <p>Very handsome, though not a little danger­ous to herself and the dancers, was
                        the princess s°quined robe, worn by a very elegant woman There was no other
                        adornment to it rave a short bolero of heavy guipure, bat the eye was bound
                        to follow it as it flashed round the room carrying destruction in its
                        train.' Another very effective frock was of pink chiffon, with isertions of
                        cream lace, and also appliques of lace, embroidered heavily with pink
                        sequin, this passemanterie forming a bold intertwin- d design in front of
                        the corsage. There was yet another in pink chiffon with wide tuckes, and
                        applications of fine black and white em broidery. Mrs. Wynne was in a soft
                        dress of finest white chiffon ornamented with long lines of doll gold, and
                        long-rayed stars in deep moonlight blue. Mrs Carton de Wiart, who had been
                        dining with Col. and Mrs. Patterson Bey, was in amber satin with lace berthe

                        in blue crepe-de Chine, and both of the-e frooks were finished at the neck,
                        with straight little tuckers drawn in with black The Misses Coles were in

                        heavily tucked and inserted with lace. The under dress was of Pampadeur
                        silk, the co- burs of which gleamed softly through the laca. Her pretty
                        daughter was in a pink gauze Empire frock with tiny wreaths of ribbon
                        flowers at neck and hem. Mrs. Maclean was wearing black with pink roses in
                        her, hair, and Mrs. Scot-Dalgleish had also tucked a pink rose into her
                        hair. The dress of the* latter was of cream satin, much guaged round the
                        waist and hips, and with a little bolero of spangled lace. Miss ffrench had
                        on a very pretty pale blue chiffon, inset with lace its own colour as well

                            Kaimakam Sowerby Bey, Traffic Manager, left by ex­press train on the 5th
                            inst. for Atbara to establish their headquarters there. The English and
                            Arabic headquarters' staff will leave here tomorrow for Atbara.</p>
                        <p>the Khedivial mail steamer Dakahlia arriv­ed from Suez on the 6th inst.
                            with a large number of officials for the Sadan Customs, such as
                            inspectors, estimators, clerks, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sequino one of Mr, Urqohart'o bridge foremen, was accidentally shot
                            in the month with his own revolver in his camp at Kilo­metre 76,
                            Suakin-Atbara line. The accident occurred in this wise. Mr. Seguino had
                            care­lessly placed his revolver on the table and it fell on the ground.
                            Whilst bending to pick it up the trigger went off owing to the
                            con­cussion and the bullet entered his. mouth through the bottom lip,
                            knocking two ot his lower teeth out The teeth happily prevented the
                            bullet from making any farther progress and there were no fatal
                            consequences. After being a few days in hospital he is perfectly well
                            again, but his speech has been slightly affected owing to the bullet
                            grazing his longue.</p>

                            Island. The funeral was well attended by Europeans and the ship's crew.
                            The Keneh. flew her flags half mast.</p>

                    <p>The brown owl sat on a gold mohar tree in Colombo's garden and looked across
                        the grassy plain which stretched in front Of him. He often rat thus on the
                        edge of the wood on sunny afternoons and pondered over what he saw.The plain
                        on which he looked was enclosedbby high iron-spiked railing whcih bore the
                        inscrip</p>
                    <p>"Khedivial.Sporting Club."</p>
                    <p>Inside, all day long, men and women pursuer balls of different sizes and
                        shapes and after much thought our garden philosopher decided that the
                        enclosure must be a beautiful institu tion for wealthy lunatics. The younger
                        lunatic rode ponies and pursued a bamboo ball fron end to end of the plain.
                        But the great majority men and women, walked round and round tb enclosure.
                        They were accompanied by black attendants who at frequent and uncertain
                        intervals handed them implements with which they struck a small white ball
                        about tb size of a hen's egg on all the faces he observed the strained and
                        tense looks of unhinged minds. One man in particular he observed II was of
                        the bulldog type and seemed to be 1 sort of king for he struok the ball
                        harder am much more frequently than the other inmates and occasionally with
                        fierce looks arid angry words would quarrel over some technical poin of
                        their strange occupation.</p>
                    <p>But this afternoon I am telling you of tb brown owl observed a strange unrest
                        among the inhabitants of the plain. It was evident that some very important
                        event or oeremon was about to take place. One by one the lung tics collected
                        on the grass below until they must have numbered thirty. They were dressed
                        beautifully as peacocks in the spring, resplen dent in many colored striped
                        jerseys. The; strutted about on the plain admiring their own legs and eyeing
                        one another with disdainful glances; now and again they would make shot
                        rapid runs as mating birds do aid utter Strange cries as they threw to and
                        fro a large brown leather egg-shaped ball.</p>
                    <p>These performances interested'the owl. H thought that the lunatic breeding
                        season wa about to commerce and some contest take place by means of which
                        the most powerful am best-dressed males would obtain their mates , Two
                        lunatics he selected as likely to prove successful in the survival of the
                        fittest. Tb first stood a bead and shoulders higher thai the other males—a
                        noble figure but alas ! no in his first youth. A slight thinning of hai over
                        his temples showed that this was not th first year by many in which he had
                        struggle and conquered. The other was a young man sturdy and thich as a
                        young oak. he was attired in all the colours of the rainbow. Hi face, placid
                        and good tempered, made the brown owl wonder if he really was insane.</p>
                    <p>As the astonished bird watched the Strang antics underneath him a weird noise
                        arose from the far corner of the plain and as he listened the sound grew
                        louder and closer.</p>
                    <p>It reminded him of the incessant cries of i parrot in the early morning. Then
                        he saw the noise proceeded from a male inmate. Hethought it must be a warder
                        for the man carried a whistle and wore a quiet coloured suit. Other wise he
                        seemed as mad as the rest. Why if he was sane did he make that continual
                        chatter ing sound, why walk in that peculiar jerky way But ha was evidently
                        the master of the afternoon's ceremony for when he arrived and blew the
                        whistle all the lunatics ranged them­selves on opposite sides and began the
                        contest.</p>
                    <p>It was the strangest sight the owl had ever seen. Sometimes the lunatics
                        would crowd over the ball like swarming bees as if they were trying to hatch
                        something out of the brown leather egg. Then out it would come from
                        their-midst and be seized by one more aotive than the rest who would clasp
                        it to his breast and run. Not for long though, for he would be seized by the
                        other contestants and hurled to the ground and .the swarming operation
                        commence again. After a time; the weakest males limped off the ground and
                        some of them lay down among the, bashes and were very ill Indeed. </p>
                    <p>So the brutal contest went on until it became evident to our garden
                        philosopher that the tall lunatic and the sturdy youth would be the viotors.
                        Whenever the latter got the ball he would run straight through the other
                        males scattering them right and left until ho placed the ball between two
                        high prists. The owl hooted with delight whenever this happened and came to
                        the conclusion that each of these efforts meant another wife for the sturdy
                        lunatic. This was as-it should be, but why should the tall male strive so
                        hard ? He did not look domestic ; his appearance suggested unlimited bridge.
                        ,</p>
                    <p>At last the end arrived. Six times had the sturdy youth grounded the ball!
                        between the posts when the warder blew a shrill blast on his whistle. The
                        lunatics limped away and the brown owl with a final hoot flew into the
                        garden, where he recounted to his wife the. strange events which bad taken
                        place.</p>

                        driven with very tight bear iog reins here? There are many very high class

                    </p>
                    <p>The question of management is one of the first importance in connexion with
                        public com­panies, and in Egypt it is particularly desirable, for many
                        reasons that an English company should be managed by an Englishman, of well-
                        known integrity, possessing special capacity for business, and a good
                        knowledge of the country. Unfortunately too many of the recently formed
                        companies have been floated by. professional company promoters, who pay
                        little regard to the personal character of the manager, and ap­parently
                        attach but little importance to the question of his local repute. The
                        Levantine, resident of Egypt it is difficult to determine' his real
                        nationality—is not always distinguished] for a high standard of commercial
                        morality; and, though he may find means to produce a divi­dend tor
                        shareholders in the first year, or two, it is usually quite unsafe to allow
                        him the, management of affairs of a company whose, directors reside in
                        England. In the course of a speech delivered in London last June, Lord
                        Cromer said</p>
                    <p>"Capital is now floating from England and other countries rapidly into Egypt,
                        and provid ed, asjs often the case, that it is devoted to sound commercial
                        industry, it is very welcome. But we want no more company mongering. We do
                        not want companies whose share capital is watered to the extent that all
                        trace of the original spirit has almost entirely disappeared. We shall
                        certainly do our best to resist the invasion these gentlemen, but the public
                        themselves must be their own principal guard­ians, and those who are asked
                        to invest in companies that are now floated I would advise to look carefully
                        to facts,and to judge for them­selves, whether the enterprise is a good one.
                        More especially would I advise them, in cases where quotations are made from
                        official and other reports, to go to the origin of those reports and to see
                        whether the conclusions that can be drawn are in fact the conclusions which
                        they are invited to draw by company promoters. The British name has hitherto
                        stood very high, and I should be extremely unwilling that name should be in
                        any degree tarnished."</p>
                    <p>Among the reputable companies formed re­cently, I mention the New Egyptian
                        Company (Limited), the Egyptian Estates (Limited), and the Egyptian
                        Investment and agency (Limited) as instances where really good work is being
                        done, benefiting the country and at the same time employing capital
                        profitably and honestly; these three companies are guided by upright and
                        capable Englishmen.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Egypt presents an unusually varied field for profitable development schemes
                        in connexion with the reclamation and improvement of agricultural land, the
                        purchase of building sites, and construction of blooks of dwelling , houses
                        and business premises. The great rise in the value of land which has
                        recently taken place is oertainly very remarkable. Twelve . years ago 33,600
                        acres of 8tate lands were sold at an average price of about £22 per acre. In
                        the same year the Daira Sanieh sold 30,670 acres at about £5 per acre, this
                        price repre­senting fully 23 years purchase of the net revenues during the
                        preceding-five years. Eight years ago, 11,840 aores of State lands were sold
                        by auotion for £26 123. per acre, and 1,423 acress off Daira Sanieh land
                        yielded an average of £33 16s. per acre. In the following year 13.774 aores
                        of the State lands realized , about £25 10s. per aore. It is interesting to
                        , compare these figures with those of more recent sales. Two years ago the
                        State Domains Administration sold 2,958 aores by auction in : lots averaging
                        21 aore°, and the price realized was £64 17e. per aore, although the
                        estimated value was only £26 6s. per acre. On one occa­sion there were no
                        fewer than 159 bidders for 27 lots. This is all indicative of the
                        excessively</p>

                        which will be really advantageous to the country, the Government has been

                        position to spend capital upon it. With the object of preventing land
                        jobbing as far as possible, every effort will be made to attract purchasers
                        who honestly mean to reclaim the land thoroughly, and who will not sell it

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Attitude</hi> of the Government</p>
                    <p>The policy of the Egyptian Government has been to endeavour to maintain the
                        small proprietors, and, whilst offering all reasonable facilities for the
                        employment of European capital in land development, to do nothing which
                        would tend towards outsing native pro­prietors and substituting Europeans in
                        their places. Most of the native farmers have neither means nor inclination
                        to sink money- in the improvement of poor or indifferent quality land; but
                        when other people have improved it, they compete with one another to a
                        wonderful extent in their eagerness to possess it. Usually the first
                        essential improve- i ment calling for the expenditure of capital is
                        drainage, and no form of expenditnre is more thoroughly appreciated by the
                        population of </p>
                    <p>Egypt generally. It also yields a very quick return. There are no
                        restrictions as to the purchase of real property in Egypt by foreigners;
                        they can acquire, hold, and dispose of it with the same freedom and in all
                        respects in the same manner as natives. The ownership <hi rend="bold">of
                        </hi>land is absolute, and can be secured by a sound title registered in
                        the- Tribunals. At­tempts have been made by certain financiers this year to
                        depreciate the value of land in Egypt with the apparent object of deterring
                        fresh competitors from extending their opera­tions to this country; but this
                        little artifice was too thin to deceive many people, and there is a gene-al
                        feeling of confidence among the highest and most experienced authorities on
                        the sub­ject that land in Egypt has not yet reached its top value.</p>
                    <p>With regard to building property, the con­struction of dwelling houses in the
                        new and fashionable quarters of Cairo and alexandria is proceeding at a
                        great pace; but house rents are very high and constantly rising, and the
                        masses of the people are restricted in coin- sequence to the old quarters,
                        where they Are huddled together in the most bewildering manner amidst the
                        foulest surroundings. I quote Lord Cromer's allusion to this subject is his
                        4898 report : —</p>

                    <p>OLD EGYPTIAN SHORTHAND.</p>
                    <p>Professor Friedrich preisigke, of the Uni­versity of strassburg, has been
                        engaged on the translation certain ancient Egyptian papyrus MSS. which he
                        recently discovered at Cxyphyn- chus, in Egypt. He has come to the
                        conclusion- that the art of stenography was ' oertainly known to the greeks
                        Egypt. in a letter from a certain merchant, nnameded Dionysius, to his
                        sister, didyme, dated November 15, "27 years after Christ the merchant
                        complains that his sister has not written to him either in the usual
                        character or stenograph'ically. Hieroglyphics.</p>
                    <p>The thoughtful aritcle by M. de Morgan in the current number of the liecueil
                        de Tra- veaux is full of interest not .'only for Egypto­logists, but also
                        for all those who have endeavoured to trace mans. earliest efforts to
                        preserve inscribed records for the use of posterity.. He tells us that, of ;
                        the , three separate systems of early writing known to us, the Egyptian
                        hieroglyphics were speedily de­based by' the use of more tractable materials
                        than the stone or wood on which they were originally, carved, until they
                        lost all but a distant resemblance to the original characters; while the
                        Chinese, from a similar cause, be­came mere groups of commas arranged in a
                        conventional order. On the other hand, the writers of cuneiform, having in
                        the day used by them a medium occupying a middle place between the
                        excessively hard stone and the easily stained papyrus or paper, preserved
                        more completely'in . their cursice writing the trace of the original
                        pictographs '.than did -the, Egyptians or Chinese ; and M. de Morgan thinks
                        that he is able to reconstitute some of these on the tablets of uncertain]
                        age dis­covered by him at Susa, which he calls proto- Elamite Thus he thinks
                        he can identify in the groups of wedges the representation of different
                        forms of pottery, of plants, of forks, combs, and axes, and of harps, bows',
                        and arrows, be­sides some more doubtful animal forms. The' instrument used
                        for producing .these was, i»' his opinion,'a style of prismatic form ending
                        in a triangular point. The source the clay used iis still problematical, as
                        he found by experiment that that actually existing in the country is unfit
                        for the purpose, having too great a proportion of sand to bake or dry well.
                        Burial Bites In Egypt. </p>
                    <p>In a leading article in the "Lancet" some years ago upon the "Ethnological
                        significance of ancient Egyptian burial Rites," a somewhat full description
                        was furnished of the early prehistoric intements of Egypt,-from which we
                        find that the skeleton was completely broken up and the bones were arranged
                        in a symmetrical order in a cavity in tho , which in these primitive times
                        served as a sepulchre.,, It was- considered that these kind of burials were
                        those of a race different from that of the so called "anoient Egyptians,"
                        and that all historical traces of the burial practices of what may betarmed
                        these proto-Egyptians had been lost.</p>
                    <p>M. Moret, however, in a recent work upon the "Daily Divine Worship in the
                        Egyptian Temples," in referring to several chapters, some of them
                        accompanied by illustrated vignettes, inscribed upon tombs, edifices or
                        papyri, proves that a whole series of rrituals­tic incantations allude to
                        and indeed derive their origin from these funerary practices. The proof of
                        the first fact occurs very convincingly in chapters 20 and 21 of the "RiUal
                        of Ammon," preserved upon a papy­rus snow at berrlin, and also upon the
                        walls of some- temples, a work that has only recently been translated. It
                        speaks of the presentation, as an act of worship to the god, of perfume and
                        oil on purpose to produoe the orderly rearrangement of his bones and
                        -mem­bers, actually asserting that his skeleton wil|' be put in order. At
                        the same time other passages of the ritual speak ot the Deity as a mummy,
                        thus indicating that in the diurnal temple worship, for this papyrus is the
                        rubric for this official cult, not only was the god assimilated to a
                        mummified hero, but that he also had to be adored by acts or
                        incantations.</p>
                    <p>These ancient rituals, therefore, afford. a mingling of the practices of the
                        alien races or of the earlier and the later ones of- the same people. The
                        .skeletons discovered Prof. Petrie and M. amelinesu and M. de Morgan upon
                        sites of the earlier Egyptian places of sepulchre had been effeotually
                        disar­ticulated and oaretolly rearranged, and the' faot that the ritual for
                        the worship of the gods in many oases deified ancestors and chiefs ooqtains
                        texts speaking of the replacing, or rather the readjustment, of the bones of
                        the skeleton to their original serial order, distinctly 'declares a
                        recollection of an epooh in which the skeleton- was broken up and arranged
                        quite otherwise than in lift The idea that the reconstruction of the
                        dismember body was a necessity in order that the spirit might again haver a
                        fit tenement to occupy runs through the rubrics required to be recited at
                        'religious fetes through almost all Egyptian' history.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Papyri and Greek Literature.</p>
                    <p>The Cambridge University Press has just issued an edition of Bacchylides
                        which crowns the series of .publications relating to work of Greek
                        literature recovered from Egyptian papyri during the last fifteen years.
                        Three works of first-rate importance for Greek literary history have been
                        thus gained during this period,Aristotle's 'Constitution of Athens,"the
                        Mimes of Herondas, and the poems of Baooliylides. In each case the course
                        of' development has been curiously similar. In each case the papyrus has
                        been acquired by the British Museum, and the editio princeps has emanated
                        thence; in each case the'bulk of the subsequent criticism, which has brought
                        tig text of the new author to an approximate!) settled state, has proceeded
                        from Germany and in each case what may be called the full dress edition,
                        with its apparatus of introduc- tions, critical notes, and commentary, has
                        been the work of England. It is noteworthy, more over, that in each case
                        this full-dress edition has been produced by a Cambridge scholar. Oxford has
                        had a predominant share in the discovery and first publication of Greek
                        papyri but when they have once been published, the resident scholars of that
                        university have apparently washed their hands, of them, and taken no part
                        .in the subsequent labours connected with them.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
