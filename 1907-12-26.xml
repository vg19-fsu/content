                    <head>YULETIDE</head>
                    <p>A certain Mr. Tusser ban gained a questionable kind of immortality by having
                        left on record the fact that Christmas comes but once year; be insists that
                        it should be everybody's delight to keep it up, and, in accordance, to make
                        good cheer. At each recurrence of the festive season the remarks of the
                        worthy Mr. Tusser find an ecbo in our hearts, although the delight is
                        generally to be found in the opposite direction. There is upity at this
                        period that anytbir.g attempted should be performed thoroughly, and we have
                        yet to meet the man, who did not bear out in the proper spirit this
                        excellent advice during the sentimental season of Christmas It is a strange
                        and curious thing how the least sentimental of us become infected by the
                        influence of Yuletide. It may arise from that eminent novelist Charles
                        Dickens having toned with sadness his homely description of Xmas. In England
                        he is inseparably connected with the great feast, and many are the families
                        wbo at evening close the shutters, and gather round the crackling long upon
                        the bearth, to bear once again tbe tale of Marley's ghost, and Gabriel Grub
                        and the goblins. We do got object to this adulteration of the plampudding,
                        anddook the watering our whisky, for it is right that in the midst of the
                        season's peace and joy we should not lose sight of the lesson that Scrooge
                        learnt that self is not the sole study in life The "Christmas Carol" is
                        revived again to the delight of Mother's Meetings, and other humorous
                        assemblies, to the joy of those ladies who love to let tall a silent tear.
                        In Egypt we assume all the gaiety, bot feel little of the pleasure that
                        Christmas brings. It can never be truly Christmas in a country, where the
                        exile eats his plum-pudding in a temperature of 65 degrees. How many of us
                        there are who drift back in the yesterday of things, when "Memory brings the
                        light of other days" te cheer Cs. It is a happy thought that carries os back
                        miles and miles across the sea to the old home, to feel again in spirit the
                        joy that the body knows no more. Perhaps the happiest instinct that
                        Christmas presents is in the recreation of our childish fancies. The snow
                        capped hills ; the hanging up of the stocking on Christmas Eve for that
                        benevolent old fellow, whom we thought supplied us with our toys; tbe
                        delight with which the postman was hailed, the merry cound of the
                        church-going bells. All crowd upon the memory to awaken the little feeling
                        that we may bave left for the simple and innocent ideas with which youth
                        endowed us We wonder now, in the light of recent events, if the old
                        superstition of Father Xmas were correct, how many extra stockings would be
                        requisitioned this year in Egypt. We must not lose sight of the joy in the
                        rude awakening at midnight, wben the quivering sound of a superannuated
                        cornet, beld by a trembling hand, would steal into our rooms breaking the
                        silence of the night. How we appreciated the idea that it was not a tremble
                        arising from sentiment which caused unnecessary trills in the music. There
                        was the old bassoon, the still older piccolo, and other nuisances of a
                        similar antiquity. Once the joy and pride of a defunct local band, the
                        course of time had dealt even more severely with these men than with the
                        well punctuated uniforms, which they wore, and which any admiral might once
                        bave envied 0! what a talling off was there! Out in the wintry cold,
                        freezing their instrumento beneath the local windows. What imperial noses
                        they all had, lasting monuments to an everlasting thirst A more glowing
                        tribute was never paid to the neighbouring distillery, than the presence of
                        these Waits afforded. Their faces were as a sunset against the snow. Still
                        they played on, until we fell asleep under the melodious strains of the
                        "Miseltoe Bough", and dreamt of the morrow's delights. And the miseltoe
                        bough! What little pleasantries bave been completed with thee as a pretext.
                        But tbe cold print shall never reveal the recollections that we carry locked
                        up in our bearts of pleasing moments beneath thy sheltering branches.
                        Although the reality of Christmas may be absent in Egypt, we still bave
                        memory to supply us with the missing ideals ; to recall the time honoured
                        joke, the merry laugh, and the soul stirring tale, and, more than all, that
                        great reunion, which bronght together the family, wbose members had dritted
                        beyond their bome in the battle of life, meeting again year after year, when
                        every minute detail connected with tormer gatherings was discussed with the
                        same enthusiasm, as if in the matter of Xmas there were no such thing as
                        past But how the grim reality presented contradictions to this feeling,
                        wben, as each meeting succeeded the otber, some smiling lace would be
                        missed. This is the sadness that intrudes upon our joy, but it is beautitul
                        to stir the smouldering asbes into ftame, and to live again in the delusions
                        of youth. Happy, happy, Christmas that can awaken our best instincts, and
                        revive our dying sympathies.</p>

                            five ships in port at once, which is ample evidence that the place is

                            Government Railways. The SS. "Ahmadi" of the Bombay Persia Line arrived

                            competition from any European merchants. These Banyans live in even more
                            frugal fashion that the native spend next to nothing on personal
                            requirements, and all their earnings are sent to ludia. It is
                            questionable whether such one sided trading can be considered
                            advantageous to the prosperity of any country, more especially the
                            Sudan, which would greatly benefit by a more reciprocal system of
                            trading to ensure a better circulation of money in the country.</p>

                    <head>CHRISTMAS IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>AT CAIRO</p>
                    <p>The comparison between Xmas at home and Xinas abroad has been worn so
                        threadbare of late, that it is almost a surprise to realize the extent of
                        the preparations that have been made in honour of the festival this week.
                        There is scarcely an English home, hotel, or shop which bas not being kept
                        busy in anticipation of the requirements of the season, and invitations,
                        parcels, cards and messages of goodwill have been scattered broadcast
                        through the land Xmas Eve was an exceptionally busy day, everybody was on
                        the move, while shops and bars were being ransacked of their choicest Was A
                        finely decorated tree was as usual in evidence in the Egyptian Hall at
                        Shepheard's during the afternoon, many people dropping in there at tea time.
                        During the evening it again became the centre of attraction for one of the
                        usual dances was in progress and the opportunity was too good to be wasted.
                        The floor was in perfect condition, and the well known Tzigane orchestra
                        under took the latter half of the programme to the great delight of the
                        dancers.Xmas morning was well on the way before the entertainment was
                        brought to a close, and Xmas wishes were the last compliments paid to many
                        as they turned their steps homeward. Another fine Xmas tree decorated the
                        dining hall of Hotel d'Angleterre that saine evening, when a very special
                        dinner was served to the guests as Fembled there, and a good programme of
                        music enlivened the proceedings. Xmas day started early and the English
                        Church was packed to its utmost capacity for the ordinary morning service,
                        while other services had been performed earlier in the morning. Branches of
                        palms and masses of flowers, poinsettias etc. replaced the ordinary
                        decorations in favour at home, and gave a very beautiful effect to the
                        editice. There was a great element of sadness in the service however for the
                        minds of many were dwelling on the horror of the fatal accident which had
                        occurred to the young chaplain of the Citadel, the Rev DP Miller, only a few
                        hours earlier, to which allusion was made by the Rev. Hilton Molesworth in
                        his sermon With the exception of this most sad occurrence, there has been
                        nothing to mar the happiness of our Imus in Cairo. There have been cheery
                        meetings on every side, and Xmas trees and Xmas dinners have been enjoyed by
                        all, and though many of us are spending the season away from English homes
                        and relatives we have had no occasion to regret the circumstance.</p>
                    <p>AT ALEXANDRIA</p>
                    <p>"East or West, Hame's Best". Despite our energetic efforts to carry out the
                        traditions of the real old English Christinas, there is lacking in this
                        country for many of us the family gathering which is the real secret of a
                        merry Christmas. There are probably none ot 118 who Can altogether put
                        sentiment aside at snch A season, and though we maintain with brave hearts
                        that "Peace on earth, goodwill to all Mea", and make our Christinas a merry
                        one, our thoughts are none the less bent towards that little island which
                        rules the seas, and our j viality is somewhat forced Christmas in Alexandria
                        was well spent, and the Briti-hers in Alexandria attended the services at
                        the churches in large numbers. t StMark's five services were held on
                        Christmas Day The total number of communicants WAY narkeilly larger than on
                        Christmas Day last year, though the numbers at the late celebration were
                        less At l'am. the church was tilled to over towing, and in addition to some
                        10 chairs placed in the church before the service, others were brought in
                        from the chapel and the vestryA full choir rendered the choral parts of the
                        service with precision and chciency which must have entailed much
                        preliminary practising and careful attention Mr. Heaton presided at the
                        organ, and the wolos in the anthem were taken by Miss Callender and Mr. W.E.
                        Sarjeant, both of whom sang with much taste and teeling. The Te Deum WAS
                        nung to a setting in D by Rev. E. Vine Hall. The anthem was "While Shepherds
                        watched their flocks by night" by Joseph Burnley. The first of the offertory

                        sung most heartily by the congregation The Communion service wus Woodwant in
                        E flat. In the sanctuary and west end of the church were placed palins and
                        plants. The tont, lectern, pulpit and choir stalls were tastefully decorated
                        with beautiful flowers and foliage. The vases placed upon the Holy Table in
                        the church and in the chapel were filled with exquisite roses, lilies of the
                        valley, and narcissi. Those responsible for the decorations were Mrs. Eyre,

                    <p>The hotels of Alexandria on Christmas night did their best to entertain their
                        many guests The Savoy Palace gave a sumptuous dinner and the bandsome dining
                        room was very well filled by tourists and residents. In the centre of the
                        room was an electric lit and heavily burdened Christmas tree, but the
                        coloured globes were almost eclipsed by the numerous tiny candles without
                        which no Christmas tree could be complete. During and after dinner the
                        orchestra of the hotel played an excellent selection of music, and Mr Brey,
                        the popular manager of the hotel, did his utmost to make all forget that
                        they were in a foreign land. The Christmas tree at the Khedivial Hotel was
                        held on Christmas eve, and there were many on that night to celebrate the
                        season, whilst last night a monster dinner was given. At the Carlton Hotel,
                        Ramleh, the table was spread with liberal Christmas fare. Indeed no matter
                        where one went Christmas greetings met the ear and Christmas liberality was
                        showered upon one. Other notes on Christmas must be held over for
                        to-morrow's issue.</p>

                    <head>A CARIO CONCERT</head>
                    <p>It is hardly fair or possible to judge the Société des Concerts or the
                        orchestra by their second concert. The mainstay and crown of the program me,
                        the music of the Forest Murmurs, had arrived too late and for Wagner was
                        substituted – Weber. Really the change of programme did seem to affect the
                        whole concert. Probably that one splendid piece might have attuned the whole
                        orchestra and their conductor to the height of excellence which, understand
                        they showed in the first concert. However that may be, there were dull
                        moments. The Weber's invitation to the valse seemed hackneyed and noisy, and
                        the long Mendlessohn savoured of a genteel drawing room The opening Mozart's
                        "Zanber Hot" was charming and well given. What delightful clean strong
                        music, full of character and delicacy. In the Italian symphony M. Baron
                        rather emphasized and bur ried the Andante movement, and the orchestra
                        hardly rose to the Presto, they did not "carry it off." But then it is deep
                        beresy to say so. It always seems to me that Mendlessohn as a rule needy
                        rather more than his due in interpretation and execution. The two Brabiny
                        dances and the Bertroz. March were excellent. They showed what the orchestra
                        could do especially in the march. "The Brahms dances perhaps require an
                        exceptional display of temperament, if the fulness of the measure and
                        changing rhythm are to be achieved. M Soubeyran sang correctly enough, but
                        was a tritle hard and unsatisfying at mo nents. The next concert should be
                        well worth hearing The programme is splendid ; and the orchestra apparently
                        can "rise' to really good music, Gluck Handel, Wagner, what more can one
                        ask, and probably Mlle Genevois for the songs. There was a good attendance,
                        though one has to confess that some of the more fashionable representatives
                        of Cairo culture were mclined to come in late and even to whisper at moments
                        during the performance. It the Societé gives such excellent music, it should
                        be rigid on that point,absolute silence and closed doors should be the rule
                        I remember so well the severity of the Oxford Musical Club, and its fine of
                        five shillings for the least sound-first offence only - subsequent offences
                        almost ranked with fines for excessive speed of motor cars! Also the double
                        curtain -if the hotel authorities will allow --it should be an improvement.
                        At present any visitor or resident who finds himself or herself in the ball
                        of the Semiramis, bas nearly as good a chance of bearing the music any of
                        the sub cribers. These are paving ten frades a concert "The others need only

                    <p>ARMY CHAPLAIN'S DEATH</p>
                    <p>We very much regret to have to announce the death of the Rev. O P Miller, MA,
                        B.Sc. Chaplain to the forces, which occurred, as the result of an accident,
                        in the early hours of Christmas morning. It appears that Mr Miller who had
                        been at the Citadel in the afternoon, went from there to Boulac by tramar
                        and on slighting he was knocked down and run over by A motor car belonging
                        to M. George Spezzaragoulos of the Splendid Bar Mr. Davey, of the Ordnance
                        Office who happened to be passing immediately gave what assistance he could
                        to the injured men, and despatched a messenger for medical assistance. Dr.
                        Madden arrived about 10 minutes after the accident, Major Harding RAMC. and
                        Bimbashi Thomson RUMO, following soon afterwards the Rev. R Armitage,
                        D.S.O., and the Rev. J Hilton Molenworth, M.A., also arriving alert the same
                        time Mr. Miller though terribly mutilated was still conscious, and was able
                        to entrust me sages to his fellow clergymen. He was conveyed to Dr. Milton's
                        Home, where he expired shortly after midnight. The Rev. Molesworth made
                        touching references to the accident at the morning service, and the regret
                        which he expressed finds an echo in the hearts of all who knew Mr. Miller.
                        The inquest will be held at noon to-day, after which the funeral will take

                        branches of business, it has left untouched, and is, indeed, entirely
                        disconnected from, the fundamental factors of Egyptian prosperity.
                        Over-speculation followed upon that prosperity and has met with its penalty,
                        but the mainspring of that prosperity, the country's inherent wealth
                        intelligently developed, remains entirely unimpaired ; the crisis of 1907 is
                        but an incident in a progress which is, humanly speaking, and in the absence
                        of some political or natural convulsion, reasonably assured. Nevertheless
                        this crisis has not been without its passing effect upon the public finances
                        of the country; it has checked the growth of those items of the revenue,
                        which, during the preceding period of general prosperity, showed the
                        greatest elasticity. Both the import duties and the fees on the transfer of
                        land, represent ing together about 21 millions of revenue, have, during the
                        last few months, shown, in lien of the rapid increase of recent years, a
                        slight diminution as compared with the corresponding period in 1906. In view
                        of these results, it has been thought prudent to take, as regards 1908,
                        &amp; somewhat less sanguine view than usual of the probable growth of these
                        revenues ; although the Customs return for November give some promise of
                        recovery in the yield of the import duty Moreover, two items of former
                        revenue disappear entirely from the receipts side of the new budget. The
                        first is that derived from pay. ments to secure exemption from military
                        service ("Badalieh.") Notwithstanding the somewhat unfavorable financial
                        conditions of the moment, the Government is of opinion that the system of
                        crediting these receipts to ordinary revenue should no longer be maintained.
                        It is felt that these payments, which the richer part of the population are
                        in a position to make in order to secure exemption from military service,
                        should be employed for the benefit of their less fortunate brethren who
                        serve as moncripts in the Army and Police. The details of the project are
                        still under consideration. The receipts in question, however, will, from
                        1908, not figure in the ordinary budget, but be carried to a special fund to
                        be devoted to the above mentioned purpose. The second item to disappear from
                        the ordinary revenue is the proceeds of the sale of Government lands. The
                        Government, apart from its liquid assets, possesses in these lands a large
                        secondary reserve. It appears desirable that the proceeds of the sale of
                        these lands, which have varied from LE 100,000 to L.E. 300,000 in recent
                        years, should be carried to the credit of the Reserve Fund, and not, as
                        heretofore, to ordinary revenue. At the same time, desirable as the change
                        may be from the point of view of accounting, too much practical importance
                        should not be attached to it, seeing that the surplus on the ordinary budget
                        carried year by year to the credit of the Reserve has largely exceeded the
                        amount of the receipts in question The elision of these two items from the
                        ordinary budget of 1908 involves a loss of receipts which were estimated in
                        1907 to amount, in the case of Military exemption, to L. E 150,000 and in
                        the case of sale of Government lands to LE 125,000 or in all to L E,
                        275,000. On the other hand, a welcome pew feature on the Receipts side of
                        the budget is the payment by the Sudan Government of LE 45,000. as interest
                        at 3 on L.E 1,500,000 ont of LE 3,300,000 advanced by the Egyptian
                        Government up to the end of 1906 for Capital Expenditure. This payment has
                        the effect of reducing the net sum to be paid by Egypt as contribution in
                        aid of the civil budget of the Sudan in 1908 to LE 208,006 from L E. 253,006
                        in 1907. It is to be hoped that with The growing resources of the Sudan, it
                        inay be found possible to lighten year by year this burden on the Egyptian
                        budget The actual Revenue for 1907 is likely to reach the sum of L.E. 16
                        100.000 and the actual Expenditure L, E. 14,100,000, enabling A surplus of
                        LE 1,704,000 to be carried to the credit of the Reserve. The unexpected
                        balance of the Govern ment's Reserve, the Fund from which Capital
                        Expenditure is met, was on the 31st October LE 7,772,336. Composed
                        originally for the major part of the sums transferred to the Government by
                        the Caisse de la Dette in compliance with the arrangement of 1904, this Fund
                        is maintained mainly by the help of surpluses on the annual budgets,
                        supplemented from time to time by exceptional receipts, such as that
                        resulting from the liquidation of the Daira estates. For some years to come,
                        and probably until 1912, no important additions to the Fund are to be
                        expected apart from such as may result from surpluses on the ordinary
                        budget. On the other hand, the amount expended out of the Reserve Fund in
                        1907 will reach nearly 44 millions, a rate of expenditure which it will be
                        difficult to reduce to any great extent in the immediate future without
                        injuriously restricting the development of the country In view of the above
                        facts, and of the peculiar restrictions to which Egypt is subjected in the
                        matter of borrowing, it is obvious that every endeavour must be made to
                        maintain the Henerve by means of surpluses on the ordinary budget. Before
                        passing from this subject it may be of interest to record the fact that the
                        balance of L.E. 600,000, payable to the Egyptian Government on the final
                        liquidation of the <cb n="6"/> affairs of the Daira Sanieh, fell due for
                        pay. ment towards the end of this year. In view of the prevailing financial
                        stringency the Egyptian Government, in deference to urgent representations,
                        has consented to the postponement of the payment of L E 500,000 of the above
                        sim. By the arrangement arrived at with the Daira Sanieh Company this debt
                        is transferred to the Crédit Poncier, which undertakes to discharge it in 4
                        years by equal instalments, paying 4% interest on the amount due. The
                        instalments as received will be paid to the credit of the Reserve Fund. This
                        arrangement, tantamount to the loan of half a million to the Crédit Foncier,
                        involves considerable sacrifices on the part of the Egyptian Government,
                        which, in order to meet the heavy expenditure on its Reserve Fund, is
                        obliged to sell securities at a in ment when these are suffering from the
                        general depreciation. It was assented to only in view of very exceptional
                        circumstances which, it may be boped, will not recur in Egypt. The year, as
                        regards the yield of cotton has been somewhat disappointing. Opening with
                        brilliant prospects, final results have been unequal, and have not in many
                        cases come up to expectation. The area under cotton was the largest on
                        record, but the total yield is unlikely to exceed that of last year. The
                        reasons for this are still somewhat obscure. The price of cotton has been
                        satisfactory.</p>

                        "Herodiade" were all three given on Monday night. But by a merciful
                        dispensation the ballet came last of all, I take it as an answer to my
                        prayers, as I was thereby able to evade it. "La Légende du Point d'Argentan"
                        is a slight one act piece by one M. Pourdrain, produced only this year in
                        Paris. The story is of a fisher couple, in great straits, the husband out of
                        work, their child ill, and the wife striving in vain to recover the secret
                        of the Argentan lace, and gain the prize for the Queen's robe. Her husband
                        goes out through the storm to seek work, she remains at his work, a wanderer
                        comes in to seek shelter and warmth. The wife relates her woes and hopes,
                        and then tired out, falls asleep over ber task. The wanderer reveals
                        herself. She is Our Lady -Herself, she summons ber Angels, who achieve the
                        wondrous robe, and leave it for the wife to find when she awakes. The music
                        is rather charming with a certain delicate and appropriate movement, a touch
                        here and there of Massenet, and even, one would say, certain moments of
                        Puccini. There were phrases and thirds of expression that distinctly
                        suggested La Bobème". The mistake of the management was the cast. Those
                        parts, slight as they seemed, should have been filled by the best singers
                        available. The opera needs that. Mlle Talbert way too restrained, and hardly
                        adequate, and the Wanderer was quite unable even to sing the music. M.
                        Gorios, as the busband, had little enough to do. He did it well. The
                        orchestra was good enough, but the performance as a whole was a tailore.
                        'Cavalleria" was the reverse Mme. Magne herself took the part of Santuzza,
                        and was superexcellent all through it. Her acting was vivid and convincing,
                        and her voice expressed to the last detail every shade of meaning the part
                        could convey. M. Gorins again was torcible and accurate, thoroughly
                        efficient. M. Flachat began badly. He seemed to be a trifle sharp in the
                        prologue, and, thongh his ucting was good, rather too noisy and harsh in the
                        church scene. But towards the end be showed the full beauty of his voice.
                        The chorus again was excellent, especially the male voices. Of course the
                        intermezzo was encored. It seems to have a relentless hold on Cairo taste.
                        Still, it is a short episode, and taking the opera as a whole, Mine. Magne's
                        singing and M. Flachat's finale were ample compensation for these lesser
                        trials.</p>

                    <p>After a lapse of many years the "Società Artistica d'Egitto" decided this
                        season to include in the programme Gounod's masterpiece, the world wide
                        favorite opera "Faust," and the production on Saturday night was altogether
                        a distinct success. As Margherita, Signorina Ida Gobbato created a most
                        favourable impression and her voice although not strong is of good quality
                        and the many difficult passages allotted to the part were exceedingly well
                        rendered. Signorina Gobbato, who is possessed of a charming presence, also
                        exhibited histrionic ability, too rarely found on the operatic stage, which
                        enabled her to present an altogether artistic impersonation. As Faust Signor
                        Narciso Del Ry was fairly successful in this very trying rôle. We hope to
                        see him to better advantage on some future occasion. Signor Carlo Walter is
                        of course an old favorite, but bearing in mind his achievements last year in
                        "Mefistofele" his performance on Saturday was a trifle disappointing. There
                        was an absence of attention to detail which marked his previous excellent
                        interpretation. His costume, too, appeared much too voluminous and
                        handicapped him in certain effects. From a musical point of view his
                        Mephisto was very acceptable, we think, however, that his rendering of the
                        favorite old serenade left room for considerable improvement. The minor
                        characters were unusually well supported, both Signorina Ida Pasotti as
                        Siebel and Signor Oreste Benedetti as Valentino being excellent in their
                        respective parts. The choruses showed considerable improvement on their
                        previous performances. The ballet "La Notte di Valpurgis" was well executed
                        and the orchestra under the guidance of Signor Zuccani was quite up to its
                        usual standard.</p>

                    <p>Mme. Germaine Grassot, of Château Chinon, was extremely anemic. She was
                        wasting away every day, and the medicines which were prescribed for her
                        failed to improve her condition. Other treatments having failed, it was an
                        excellent occasion for Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People to fill the

                        the good which Dr. Williams' Pink Pill: have done me, they have given me all
                        the relief that a medicine possibly could give. And I am the more indebted
                        to you because, though I ha! previously taken many other medicines, none of
                        them succeeded in remedying my very grave state of anemia. I feared that I
                        was con demned to suffer for ever from palpitation of the heart and sick
                        headaches and that I will always to remain weak, and without appetite and
                        complexion. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, however, dispelled
                        that fear, and gave me renewed hope, because they at 7 relieved and
                        strengthened me. Thanks to them I am now in perfect health." Anemic people
                        suffer from poverty of the blood. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills create blood It
                        should be remembered that on the quality of one's blood depends the
                        forgetfulness of one's energies, both outwardly manifested and in wardly
                        felt. It is the blood, by its continuous and free circulation, that
                        regulates the nervous system and accords to each portion of the human
                        organism an energy in proper proportion of requirements Dwell upon this and
                        you will then understand the importance of good blood. And recognising the
                        influence of the blood, you will also appreciate the influence of Dr.

                            <p>Senate. Mr. Blanchier asked Mr. Pichon to reserve a supplementary
                                credit for 1909 for the Eastern schools. He said that England is
                                tending to make Egypt a land of the English language, and added that
                                in another five years the French section of the Khedivial law School
                                would no longer exist. Mr. Genourier ? asked for the appointment of
                                a parliamentary commission to examine the question of Eastern
                                protectorates Mr. Pichop refused and pointed out the prosperity of
                                the colleges of Beyrouth, Cairo, and Constantinople The Government
                                desired to create a normal school in the East and will give
                                subsidies to the lay founders in the East who actively assist the

                                action on the Persian frontier, is emphatically denied. Germany on
                                several occasions, and notably at the commencement of the frontier
                                dispute, in September 1906, advised Turkey to conclude with Persia a
                                pacific arrangement The German Government's attitude with regard to
                                the question has not changed up to the present.</p>

                    <p>THE PARTY OF THE PEOPLE</p>
                    <p>DEATH OF THE LEADER</p>
                    <p>We regret to announce the sudden death of Hassan Abdul Razik Pasha, the
                        leader of the Party of the People and a member of the Legislative Council,
                        which occurred yesterday morning in Cairo. He was an intimate friend of the
                        late Sheikh Mohamed Abdon, the Grand Mufti of Egypt, and he was in many
                        respects an excellent sample of the enlightened Egyptian. The funeral, which
                        was attended by a large number of mourners, took place yesterday afternoon
                        in the Mosque of Iman el Sbafai. The following is the text of the political
                        manifesto, addressed last week to tbe publie im England, by the late Hassan
                        Abdul Razik Pasha. It appeared in the London "Standard" in the form of a
                        letter to the Editor and is as follows: Sir,- Please allow me to express to
                        you my sincere thanks for the kindly discrimination shown in your columns
                        regarding the "Party of the People." May I take this opportunity of
                        describing briefly the aims and organisation of the party in question, in
                        order that the public in England may be more accurately acquainted with the
                        real facts of the situation as they stand in Egypt. l'p till now,
                        intelligent Egyptians have believed that the British occupation of Egypt was
                        accidental, and that it would be removed when the causes that brought it
                        about were removed. That belief is based on the conti dence which the
                        Egyptians have in the promises of the British nation-a confidence which was
                        made stronger still by the negotia tions that took place between Britain and
                        Turkey in 1887 through Sir H. Drummond Woiff. Thus the Egyptians have
                        silently watched the economical, moral, and political progress that has been
                        effected in the country, in the full belief that, as soon as these reforins
                        should be completed and based on solid ground, such as would justify for the
                        Egyptians complete autonomy, and guarantee for. Great Britain and the rest
                        of the European nations their respective interests, the management of the
                        affairs of Egypt would then be entrusted to purely Egyptian hands, thereby
                        tulfilling the words of the late Mr. Gladstone "Egypt for the Egyptians."
                        The material progress achieved in Egypt during the last 25 years has been
                        marvellous. But as yet there has scarcely been any real attempt at
                        educational and political reform Education is still being carried on in such
                        a manner as not to secure the desired results ; and in practice the
                        representatives of the Egyptian nation are not given such privileges as are
                        consistent with and adapted to Egypt's present social condition This has
                        foubt aroused in the nation a certain degree of anxiety. The desire for
                        progress in the direction of self-government led a number of Egyptian no
                        tables, including a great number of the Le gislative Council and General
                        Assembly, to hold a meeting, in which they decided to make every effort to
                        secure the desired end, and established for that purpose a paper, "Al Ga
                        ridah," to be their organ. These notables pab licly declared their
                        principles, aims, and the means to attain them on September 21, 1907, a has
                        already been reported to you by your Correspondent in ('airo. The number of
                        these notables has now increased to 170 The aim of the Party of the People"
                        is progress towards autonomy. Its means for securing that end are to make
                        elementary education general, obli gatory, and free: to promote higher
                        education, and to persuade the Government to acknow ledge the natural rights
                        of the people by extending the jurisdiction of the Provincial Councils, the
                        Legislative Council, and General Assembly in such a way as to produce
                        effectual co-operation by the representatives of the people with the
                        Government in public matters in order that the autonomy promised by the
                        English may ultimately be attained. These, in short, are the views of the
                        "Party of the People," and, I may add, of the best classes of Egyptian
                        society. It is true there are some who seem to mistrust the English and to
                        forget how advantageous it is to our political progress to preserve the best
                        possible relations between Egypt and England. Fortunately, the influence of
                        these people is practically limited to inexperienced youths, who, here as
                        elsewhere, uphold extreme views. The organ of this party is "Al Lewa," and
                        it calls itself the National party. Opposed to that party stands another
                        that exists in little more than name. Its policy is to exalt the British
                        Administration in Egypt, in season and ont of season, finding no fault
                        whatever with it. "Al Mokattain" is the organ of this party, which calls
                        itself the Liberal National party. What is of importance to all Egyptians,
                        how ever diverse may be their views concerning reform, is to try to convince
                        the British public of the fact that the existing Adininistration neglects
                        higher edncation, that it has not looked favourably upon the university
                        enter prise, and that it is not prepared to extend the Organic Law. All this
                        is calculated to make for estrangement between the Egyptians and the
                        British, which estrangement some mis taken enthusiasts use as a fertile
                        ground in which to scatter those seeds of dissension which are hated alike
                        by wise Egyptians and, so far as we can see, by wise Englishinen, too.</p>

                        more under European influence the above mentioned Mobainmad Ali, who founded
                        the Khedivial dynasty, and his successors were fully alive to the practical
                        benefits which might be obtained from the superior culture of the West, and
                        although their policy in this respect, was marked by greater zeal than
                        discretion, they did not exert themselves altogether in vain. The
                        introduction of the printing press in 1821 was an epoch-making measure. If,
                        on the one hand, the publication of many classical works, which had
                        well-nigh fallen into oblivion, rekindled the enthusiasm of the Arabs for
                        their national literature, the cause of progress- I use the word without
                        prejudice - has been furthered by the numerous political, literary, and
                        scientific journals which are now regularly issued in every country where
                        Arabic is spoken. Besides these ephemeral sheets, books of all sorts, old
                        and new, have been multiplied by the native and European presses of Cairo,
                        Bulaq and Beyrout. The science and culture of Europe have been rendered
                        accessible in translations and adaptations of which the complete list would
                        form a volume in itself. Thus, an Arab may read in his own language the
                        tragedies of Racine, the comedies of Molière, the fables of La Fontaine,
                        "Paul and Virginia" the Talisman' Monte Cristo' (not to mention scores of
                        minor to mances, and even the Iliad of Homer The learned and purely
                        technical literature derived immediately or indirectly from Europe 18
                        extensive. In short, France and Britain have taken the place which was
                        oecupied in the Golden Age of Islam by Greece and India, but we must, I
                        think, confess that down to the present day the results of all this activity
                        amount to little more than the proverbial mouse Hitherto modern culture has
                        only touched the surtace of Islam. Whether it will eventually strike deeper
                        and penetrate the inmost barriers of that scholastic discipline and literary
                        tradition which are so firmly rooted in the affections of the Arab people,
                        or whether it will always continue to be an exotic and highly prized
                        accomplishment of the enlightened and emancipated few, but an object of
                        scorn and detestation to Moslems in general these are questions that may not
                        be solved for centuries to come. Meanwhile the past affords an ample and
                        splendid field of study. "Man lam ya'i'l ta'rikha fi sadrihi Lam yadri hulwa
                        'layshi min murrihi Wa man wa' akhbara man qad madà Adafa amaran ila umrihi
