                    <head>MAKING A WAR.</head>
                    <p>The American papers say that it their fleet goes to the Pacific it means
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The New York "San," on Sept. 29, wrote thus :-"Mr. Roosevelt has reaffirmed
                        his intention of sending the entire effective naval force of this country to
                        the Pacific Ocean, and simultaneously the General Board has delivered to Mr.
                        Metcalf its recommendations for an increase of the navy. The two facts are
                        vitally Borrelated. Those who apparently have the right to express
                        authoritative explanations of the object of the transferring of the navy to
                        the Western ocean persist in saying that it is for practice. We regret to
                        say that we share the Japanese belief that the explanation is false. The
                        navy is going to the Pacific Ocean for war with Japan, and Japan recognises
                        the fast and is energetically preparing for it. Once the operation of
                        transferring our ships to Pacific waters has been accomplished, what is
                        inevitable. It is an insane project. </p>
                    <p>The American people do not want to go to war with Japan or with any other
                        country, but the American people are apparently without recourse or voice.
                        There is little or no hope that Congress will dare to oppose the President's
                        plans. It is one of the most serious situations that have confronted this
                        country, and the only mitigating consideration we are able to discern is
                        that the activity of the Navy Departments, and of the War Department too, at
                        this present moment indicative of full sense of the gravity of the impending
                        crisis." The "New York Times" devotes an entire 1 page to the discussion of
                        America's answer to the attitude of Japan," and "the sudden cessation of
                        pin-pricks when Tokio learned that the armada was to be moved to the
                        Pacific." </p>
                    <p>"Is the Press of the United States going insane" asks the "Times". New York
                        correspondent, who sends this news. "It is no use trying to minimise the
                        gravity of its attitude or its ability to stir up trouble. We know pretty
                        well by now what was the real cause of the Spanish-American war and the man
                        who among all Americans was chiefly responsible for it. A letter from Mr.
                        William Randolph Hearst is in existence, and was printed in a magazine not
                        long ago. It was to an artist whom he had sent to Cubs, and who reported no
                        likelihood of war. Mr. Hearst instructed him to stay. You provide the
                        pictures, he wrote, I'll provide the war."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Taft, the American Secretary for War, speaking at a banquet at Tokyo on
                        Oct. 1, said :- "There is only a little cloud over our friendship of fifty
                        years, and the greatest earthquake of the century could not shake our
                        amity." Mr. Taft declared that the San Fran cinco affair could be finally
                        and honourably adjusted through diplomatic channels. War between Japan and
                        the United States would be a crime against civilization. Neither of the two
                        peoples wanted it, and both Governments would strain every nerve to prevent
                        a conflict. Mr. Taft characterised as infamous the attempts which the
                        newspapers were largely responsible. In conclusion, he told his hearers that
                        they could rest assured that America's goodwill towards Japan was as cordial
                        as ever.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the fact that he had been honoured with a second invitation to
                        have an audience of the Emperor, Mr. Taft said that he felt it was due to
                        the desire of his Majesty to send a message of good will to the Americans
                        and to show the world that Japan was friendly to the United States. The
                        speech created a splendid apression.</p>

                    <p>A London correspondent writes :</p>
                    <p>I understand that Mustapha Pasha Kamel is no longer to enjoy any support from
                        Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P. This severance has been brought about owing to the
                        same reasons which have led to the present dissensions among the
                        Nationalists in Egypt, for it has become evident that the Pasha is seeking
                        to make the Nationalist movement subserve first and last the cause of his
                        personal ascendency. </p>
                    <p>The manner in which the organ of Mustapha Pasha Kamel has of date attacked
                        Hafiz Awad has produced a very bad impression among the section of Radicals
                        who were inclined to support the Pasha. These proceedings are attracting
                        some attention and in a letter from Cairo of September 15th the
                        correspondent of the "Times” gave a snooinot account of the controversy,
                        from which I extract the following: </p>
                    <p>"Jealous of any encroachment on the prero.. gatives of their creator,
                        Mustapha Kamel Pasha's degans have assailed Hafia Awad in unmeasured terins,
                        accusing him of inconsistency and self-seeking, and of falsely claiming to
                        be the originator of his programme and the representative or delegate of the
                        National movement. That he should go to London," says the "Egyptian
                        Standard," "and seek notoriety is a right we cannot deny him. But that he
                        should do so at the expense of other people and by pawning (sic) off other
                        people's Ideas as his own is a questionable procedure and one that he will
                        have to repent upon his return to Cairo. ..."</p>
                    <p>Such glimpses into the dissensions of the Nationalists, have caused a
                        disagreeable impres. sion and it is considered that the organs of Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel are to be blamed for having initiated such tactics Under these
                        circumstances it is not to be wondered if Mr. Robertson has decided to have
                        no longer any relations with Mustapha Pasha Kamel</p>

                        primary certificate and 18 hold no certificate at all. No holder of a
                        secondary certificate has applied for admission to the school.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Graham adds that Mr. Robertson's question is evidently founded on a
                        misapprehension. He has, apparently, confused the regulations for admission
                        with the financial conditions which prevail for those who, after a four
                        years' course, have gained the diploma in Agriculture.</p>

                        on the last Monday of the month, will be opelosed in what is colloquially
                        called a "gold box" of the usual hundred-guinea type. This casket says,
                        "Modern Society," will comprise designs recalling the art of ancient Egypt,
                        and will also symbolise the new Egypt which has been called into being by
                        the exertions of the great Agent General during his many years of patient
                        service in Cairo. The event is arousing much enthusiasm in civil circles,
                        and it will be the last great function of the Mayoralty of Sir William
                        Treloar. A large number of invitations are to be sent out, and there is an
                        idea of anticipating the glories of Lord Mayor's Day at the end of the
                        following week by putting up some of the street decorations and bringing on
                        the City's illuminations in honor of the day.</p>
                    <p>If this is carried out, the hub of the universe will present an unusually
                        festive appearance for more than a fortnight, because the decorative
                        features of November 9th will remain until the following Wednesday, which is
                        the day accepted by the German Emperor for his own second visit to the
                        Guildhall. Fifteen years ago His Imperial Majesty received at the hands of
                        the Lord Mayor of the day a gold box of the value of 250 guineas, a sum
                        which has been exceeded on two occasions only. A box of the value of £275
                        was offered to King Edward at about the time of his marriage, and many years
                        afterwards the late Emperor of Russia received a hox valued at £337. It is
                        rather anomalous to remember that Muzaffer: 1 ed-Din, the late Shah of
                        Persia, and his predecessor received between them gold boxes of the value of
                        500 guineas.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S MEAT SUPPLY<lb/>THE BUTCHERS' COMPLAINTS</head>
                    <p>The Cairo butchers at the present time are complaining that the regulations
                        regards the closing of the markets and the restrictions on the transport of
                        cattle are seriously damaging their business. But these regulations have
                        been laid down by the Board of Health for the general well-being of the
                        country and it isb impossible that the interests of the entire I population
                        should be set aside because these restrictions injuriously affect the trail
                        of a single class. It would be the height of foolishness to allow cattle
                        from abroad, which are infected to be taken to Cairo without let or
                        hindrance. The import into Egypt of Servian cattle is by way of Salonica,
                        which is an infected port. The large cattle importers should bring the
                        cattle through Constanza, which is immune. If they made use of the Roumanian
                        port as the point of departure for Egypt, the Government might possibly see
                        its way to allow the unrestricted import of Servian cattle to the
                        slaughterhouses of the interior. As long, however, as Salonica remains
                        infected, careful restrictions must be enforced.</p>
                    <p>Salonica will probably always be infected. It is a Turkish port and the
                        authorities do not exercise any effective control over the cattle plague. Of
                        course it is a very convenient port for the export of cattle to this country
                        as it is in direct communication by rail with Servia and far nearer to Egypt
                        than Constanza, but as long as the Ottoman sanitary authorities remain
                        indifferent the Quarantine Board at Alexandria must exercise great
                        discrimination in regard to the cattle arriving here from the Macedonian
                        port. </p>
                    <p>The grumbling of the butchers at the import of frozen meat may be quite
                        disregarded as it is solely based on selfish interests.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that a deputation consisting of Mr. Desposito, Mr. Zender,
                        Mr. Trinkidis, Mr Dejean, Mr. Stelio Bulga, Mr. Stamati, Cheilk Fargalli,
                        and Mr. John B. Caffari, the Managing Director of Caffari's Co-Operative
                        Markets Ltd. were invited to attend a meeting held yesterday morning at the
                        hend office of the Sanitary Department to discuss with Dr. Graham Bey,
                        Colonel Carner, and Mr. Littlewood, the matter concerning the difficulties
                        in obtaining sufficient quantity of cattle for the Cairo consumption.</p>
                    <p>A petition had been submitted a few days ago to the sanitary authorities
                        requesting the reopening of certain markets in Upper Egypt and to permit the
                        importation of foreign cattle. The officials having studied this very im.
                        portant matter, have been able to give satisfaction to the members of the
                        deputation, and thus avoided a general strike of the butchers, which would
                        have greatly inconvenienced the entire population of Cairo. The deputation
                        Before retiring 'expressed their thanks to Dr. Graham Bey, Colonel Garner,
                        and Mr. Little wood for the kind reception accorded and the promises
                        made.</p>

                    <head>HELLENIC SCHOOLS.</head>
                    <p>This morning the scholastic year of the Hellenio community's schools at
                        Alexandria began after the summer holiday. Monsignor Theofanis Moschonas,
                        Metropolitan of the Thebaid, and Vicar representative of the Patriarch,
                        conducted a service. The boy's school has been considerably enlarged and all
                        through the summer a large staff of workmen have been employed on the
                        construction. An extra storey on the left side of the big quadrangle has
                        been created and a number of new class-rooms added. On the ground floor
                        there are seven large class-rooms for elementary education, each room being
                        seven by nine metres. The mess room is fourteen by twelve metres. Ten'
                        bath-rooms and a number of lavatories, eto.. have been constructed and also
                        a sitting room for the staff of teachers. On the first floor three
                        class-rooms, forty two metres square each, have been built for the drawing
                        and commercial department, and five other rooms, nine by seven metres square
                        for the higher classes. On this floor also are a private room for the
                        headmaster and a sitting room for the teachers and class rooms for
                        instruction in science and music. The playground has been considerably
                        enlarged and is now sixty two metres in length and nineteen breadth. All
                        along the first floor runs a balcony, ninety five metres in length. The
                        architecture was entrusted to the Greek engineer of Alexandria, Mr. George
                        Lozinas, who is also the architect of the Benachi Orphanage, the Salvago
                        Polytechnic, the Zervudnchi Elementary Schools, and the Free Kitchen of Mrs.
                        Benachi. Cavalliere Diananti is the contractor. The cost of enlarging the
                        boys school was L.E. 7,000 and it is now one of the largest colleges in
                        Egypt. Last year there were 1,271 boys and 1,000 girls attending these
                        schools.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND BABYLONIA.<lb/>PROF. FLINDERS PETRIES LECTURE.</head>
                    <p>The lecture, which was given last week at University College by Professor
                        Flinders Pe. trie, marks the immense popular interest which is now being
                        devoted to ancient Egypt and Babylonia. Not so very long ago an Egyptologist
                        was looked upon rather as the near relation of his beloved mummies than as a
                        sane human being. Now scarabe are popular subjects for pins and rings, and
                        Egypt and Babylonia are being restored to their pristine glory. The progress
                        of sociology is, of course, one of the factors in the Egyptian movement, and
                        the discovery of the Rosetta stone gave the clue to the gold mine of
                        information which the two civilizations furnished for ethical and social
                        comparison. A little band of devoted students, among whom Professor Flinders
                        Petrie holds a high rank, haa by translations and histories placed ancient
                        Egypt and Babylonia within the reach of those who can now read the Book of
                        the Dead and the Laws of Hammurabi without any knowledge of hieroglyphs or
                        cuneiform inscriptions.</p>
                    <p>This lecture was the first of a course of lectures upon the civilization and
                        conditions of the two oldest centres of culture, the river valleys of Egypt
                        and Babylonia. The formation of the Nile Valley, he declared, was due to a
                        great fault consequent on the np beaval, of the eastern desert, which rises,
                        to 5,000ft, while the western winks below sea-level in the Fayoum and
                        Sahara, Into this fault-line the drainage worked its way and gouged out a
                        valley about 2,000ft. deep, the lower pact of which is filled up for goine
                        hundreds of feet by debris now below sea level.</p>
                    <p>Upon this the Nile has deposited a coat of mohl since the rainfall ceased
                        owing to the drying of the Sahara. This mad-bed is about 40ft) thick, and
                        has grown about thin. a century during about 10,000 years But Egypt can not
                        grow seawards, as the deposits are washed away in the Mediterranean as soon
                        as they pass the shelter of the limestone cliffs of Alexandria and
                        Canopus</p>
                    <p>The conditions are entirely different in Babylonia. In place of a rift valley
                        trenched 2,000ft. deep the Babylonian plain is a long, wide synclinal trough
                        of depression between the highlands of Arabin and Persia. The valley is
                        essentially all one from its rise near the Black Sea down to the Straits of
                        Hormuz, at the month of the Persian Gulf. The bed of this valley has been
                        more than half submerged, up to the Balıylon; and the wash brought down has
                        gradually filled it to the present const. In another 15,000 or 20,000 years
                        it will fill up all that is now the Persian Gulf. </p>
                    <p>As all the material washed down falls into land-looked, still, shallow water
                        it is not swept away, as in the Mediterranean, but is deposited, and
                        gradually makes more land. The const, therefore, has moved south over two
                        miles each century. Thus it is clear that the sites of the great cities of
                        Babylonis were open son within the last 10,000 or 15,000 years.</p>

                    <p>We remind our readers that tomorrow, commencing at 2.45 p.m. prompt, there
                        will be held in the New Graving Dook, Gabbary, the fifth annual aquatic
                        sports of the Alexandria Swimming Cluband of the most graciously extended
                        patronage of his Highness the Khedive. We are also glad to announce that the
                        meeting will be attended by H.B.M'. Consul General Gould and Mrs Gold, and
                        that many other notables of the European communities of Alexandria and of
                        the Native world have promised to be present. As for the sport to be
                        witnessed, nothing can prevent this from being of the Keenest. A glance at
                        Last year's programme, which was "in itself record olive, shows that the
                        number of entries has increased for every event, and in many instances the
                        list of competitors is considerably larger. The "form" shown by the
                        competitors, too, at the weekly meetings of the club has been fully np to
                        the mark, and the thoroughness of the handicapping guarantees as &amp;
                        succession of exciting fights for victory. The great event of the meeting,
                        the 60 yards club handicap for the much-coveted Sirdar's medal, has aroused
                        enormous interest and called forth 28 competitors, as compared with 20 last
                        I year; it will be swum off as usual in four heats, the first two in ench of
                        which will contest the final. Match humour and laughter is to be caused by
                        "walking the pole," for, being in the know, we are able to say that the
                        fancy costumes are more than ever. "screamingly funny," na the pierrots say,
                        and most original. To detail the evetta, however, is impossible and we must
                        be content with Assuring our readers that each will offer as good sport as
                        one could wish to see. The club bonita amongst its members past champions of
                        note in the amateur world of swimming, and who knows that budding champions
                        may not swim the bath or cleave the water in groft dives to-morrow The
                        muccess of former meetings has been great, but the sports of 1907 are going

                        and featureless, with constant fluctuations of a few points either way.
                        There has been less pressure to sell generally and to-days closing values
                        are 7 1/2 to 1 points higher than those of last Thursday, the near positions
                        having appreciated whilst the more distant positions have fallen to
                        discounts. The Market having been too much depressed upon the Ginners and
                        Bureau reports reached sharply, bur failed to maintain more than a partial
                        improvement. We are now coming to the period when there will be considerable
                        nervousness, a sudden fall in temperature, would with the considerable
                        shortage existing in all the markets especially in New York and New Orleans,
                        probably cause a sharp rise, but so far the article has failed to attract
                        any important outside interest, due no doubt largely to the stringency of
                        money, and the depressed condition of Stocks and Shares.</p>

                            <p>The Conference has unanimously adopted the regulations governing
                                submarine mines, but the reservations of several of the Powers
                                practically nullify the most important provi. sions as far as they
                                are concerned. These include Russia, Germany, France, and Siam. Sir
                                E. Satow expressed regret that the British proposals limiting the
                                area of mine laying had been rejected. The rights of neutrals, he
                                considered, remain insufficiently guarded. Herr Bieberstein stated
                                that Germany would only lay mines in cases of urgency. </p>

                    <head>SAYYID EL-BERRI'S ESSAY</head>
                    <p>A highly interesting contribution on the subject of Egypt and Islam was made
                        to the Church Congress last week by Professor Margoliouth, of New College,
                        Oxford, who holds the position of Laudian Professor of Arabio. The Professor
                        said a controversial challenge, an appeal to settle the conflicting claims
                        of Islam and Christianity by argument, existed to some extent in Egypt; but
                        it would be truer to say that the Moslems there had taken up the chal lenge
                        of the Christian missionaries, and endeavonred to refute their objections to
                        Islam. He should imagine, however, that such attacks on Christianity were
                        far less common and far less often based on modern European theology in
                        Egypt and Syria than in India. The challenge that attracted our attention
                        was of a somewhat different sort. The reformers of Islam ir Egypt confessed
                        - not unfrequently with exaggeration—that Moslems were both moral. ly and
                        intellectually decadent, that Islam represented stagnation, and European
                        civilization progress ; only they denied that Islam was the cause of
                        thestagnation and Christianity the cause of the progress. The first writer
                        whose opinions on this subject might be summarized was the Sayyid-al-Bekri,
                        one of the best scholars and the most distinguished men in Cairo, who had
                        within the last few months published an essay on the "Future of Islam." As
                        the head of the religious orders he should have better opportunities of
                        knowing about the progress and aspirations of his religion than anyone else
                        ; it was, therefore, of great interest that he went for his facts almost
                        entirely to french and English authorities : when he deserted these the
                        facts appeared to be open to question, as where he stated that the number of
                        Sufis was 100,000 millions, which was more than 50 times the whole
                        population of the globe. He argued that Islam was shown to be the religion
                        of the future by the vast increase which it exhibited in recent years, to
                        which he proceeded to assign a variety of causes. Since the increase was
                        chiefly in Egypt and India, and by births, not by conversions, the real
                        cause appeared to be one that he had omitted -- viz., the excellence of
                        British role; for in self-governing Moslem States no such increase appeared
                        to be shown. The causes that he did state were: five, and they had been
                        anticipated by European thinkers. They were the simplicity of Islam; the
                        reasonableness of Islam; the skill of Moslem missionaries; the institntion
                        de polygamy; and the dislike of pagan races to Europeans, due to caste
                        distino|tion by colonr The European could not help trenting yellow races
                        like servants and negroes like slaves. After stating these cases for the
                        propagation of Islam, the Sayyid proceeded to I give an account of the
                        political depression of Islam, and to suggest a remedy And here his
                        treatment of the subject was similar to that of other Morlems who had dealt
                        with the question. Ignorance was what depressed Islam, and teaching was the
                        cure for it. Native Governments would not see to the proper instruction of
                        the people, because they feared to roose the desire for equality; foreign
                        Governments would not see to it for the same or a similar <cb n="3"/> reason
                        ;' it must be done by the enlightened Moslems themselves. The only way,
                        then, was to found societies, whose concern should be the fature of Islaın,
                        all grouped in a parent society, to hold its meetings in some central
                        locality. We could only say let the Sayyid's experiment be tried ; instil
                        into the minds of the Moslem youth the best moral and intelleotual notions,
                        and let us see what the result would be for Islam. A reformed Islam had been
                        preached for some nine years in a Caireno magazine called the "Besoon,”
                        which was said to enjoy greater popularity than any other journal published
                        in the Arabic language. The movement which it represented might be described
                        as partly Protestant partly rationalistio in character ; its adherents
                        maintained that Islam was decadent, because the Word of God (as they called
                        the Koran) had been obscured by a mass of unauthorized tradition, which had
                        oramped men's understandings and laden them with burdens too heavy to be
                        borne. They advocated a return to the original revelation, and claimed the
                        right to the free use of the reason in interpreting it. When in his last
                        report Lord Cromer was supposed to attack the Moslem religion and charge it
                        with standing in the way of progress, the Sayyid Rasbid, the editor of the
                        "Beacon" and the leader of the reform party, wrote to ask his lordship
                        whether his reference was to Islam in general, or to Islam as interpreted by
                        the law schools, rightly supposing that his lordship's opinion would carry
                        great weight in Earope and elsewhere. The reply was such as to confirm the
                        doctrine preached in the "Beacon," that Islam was not in itself responsible
                        for stagnation or reaction, but only the interpretation put on Islam by the
                        or thodox exponents of its tenets. How far was the programme of the
                        reformers of Islam identical in its practical effects--without reference to
                        dogmas—with that of European missionaries, teaching the morality which we
                        Associated with the Gospel, as interpreted by centaries of experience and
                        observation The matter on which Christianity diverged most from Islam was
                        the treatment of women. It was a pleasure to find that the reformers of
                        Islam had not left this matter out of account, and that the equalization of
                        the sexes was preached by some Moslems on the ground of the Koran and
                        stranger still the Prophet's sayings and practice. The pjoneer in this most
                        necessary reform was Kasim Bey Amin, whose works on the "Emapoipation of
                        Women" and The New Woman" had been favourably received. He made ont a list
                        of woman's wrongs which cried for redress, and placed among them the
                        practices of polygamy and concubinage, which we, most of us, associated with
                        the names of the Islamic Prophet and his religion. To find a Moslem who
                        asserted that he would not entertain any doctrine contradicted by the Koran,
                        condemning poly gamy, was surely a most hopeful sign for the regeneration of
                        the East, Kasim Boy Amin gave us the cheering information that in Egypt
                        during the last 20 or 30 yeårs-i.e., since the British occupation--the
                        practice of polygamy had been steadily decreasing, and the seclusion of
                        women vastly modified. The continuance of these institutions he held to be
                        impossible they were doomed by the force of circumstances; his purpose was
                        to popularise and hasten the spread of the reform, and to prove it to be in
                        harmony with the spirit of Islam. To take one other matter, religious
                        toleration, it would be contrary to the experience of mankind if the
                        magnificent toleration exhibited by Great Britain--under whose
                        administration the mosques were better cared for than ever before-had not
                        met with some response. The signs of such were to be looked for in the
                        attitnde of Islam towards Oriental Christianity rather than European
                        Christianity, which was, of course, associated with power and knowledge. And
                        such signs were not wanting. Last De. cember, when the foremost Christian
                        Arabic scholar in Cairo was removed by death, warm tributes to his merits
                        appeared in many Moslem journals; and a Christian now resident in Cairo was
                        regarded by Moslems or at least by many of them as one of the foremost, -it
                        not actually the chief, Arabic writer of the time. He had been told that
                        sabsoriptions from Moslemns towards, new churcbes, and from Christians
                        towards new mosques, were common events in fashionable circles. If it be
                        asked, in view of these facts, where did missionary work come in, it might
                        be replied that where there was much work to be done, where we were faced by
                        problems to which &amp; completo solution could not be found, pradence
                        suggested the encouragement of a variety of agencies. Even the controversy
                        which prosélytizing work provoked probably led many to use their thinking
                        pbwers in estimating the claims of rival creeds. Bat a reform of Islam from
                        within must necessarily be more efficacious than anything which could be
                        attempted from the outside. The creation of mutual respect between the two
                        communities or groups of communities was essential before the amalgamation
                        of the one with the other could be dreamed of. And it, as the years
                        proceeded, the chief thinkers of Islam still found, as they did now, that
                        their religion was everywhere nocompanied by intellectual and moral
                        stagnation, that their efforts at raising their country. men on the basis of
                        the Koran were futile, perhaps they would determine that that basis must be
                        abandoned, and that the sources of enlightenment must be the same for them
                        as for Europe. </p>

                    <head>THE LAMBERT AFFAIR.</head>
                    <p>The following letter has been published in the "Temps" from Mr. Lambert:</p>
                    <p>I have hitherto refrained from supplying food to the polemics aroused by my
                        resignation, because I was not entirely free from the bonds of my-Egyptian
                        fonctions. I have now recovered my freedom of speech and am glad to profit
                        thereby in order to make known the reasons which constrained me to abandon
                        the management of the Khedivial School of Law. </p>
                    <p>I renounced this position not without a real pang, because the place was suoh
                        as a man of science conld not retain ; because I could maintain myself in
                        this well paid situation only on the condition of being the blind instru.
                        ment of a policy as incorrect, as it was compromising for the cordiality of
                        the relations existing between natives and Europeans.</p>
                    <p>The English functionary who has the effective control of the Ministry of
                        Public Instruction, Mr. Douglas Donlop, daring the year which preceded my
                        arrival in Cairo, had already with rare perseverance undermined the
                        authority of the director, and taken advantage of the moment when this
                        authority was reduced to nothing, to exasperate the students by measures
                        both brutal and useless, thus provoking a strike which had furnished him
                        with the opportunity of venting his rancor against my predecessor. I was not
                        treated any better. The English Adviser raised np for me inextricable
                        embarrassments by wilful or involuntary blunders, of which I could not avert
                        the consequences, being closely bound by regulations which took away from me
                        all, even the technical, control of my establishment, and handed it over to
                        the offices of the Ministry. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Danlop has blindly combatted the development of French culture in a
                        school, whose teaching nevertheless is and will remain, as long as the
                        legislation of the country is not completely revolutionized, a tenching of
                        French law, because the Egyptian codes are only reductions of onr own, and
                        because with the exception of some rare monographs they have inspired no
                        original literature. He organised in this establishment a veritable parody
                        of higher education, while abstaining from preserving the fixed staff of the
                        French section, on the plea that it was destined shortly to disappear, and
                        expelling from the most frequented section, that in which French law is
                        taught in the English language, the excellent collaborators of long
                        standing, the magistrates whom a long sojourn in the country had habi.
                        tuated to the mechanism of our law, to replace them by young fellows
                        appointed on their leaving an English University, who disembark in Egypt as
                        ignorant of the principles of jurisprudence in force in the country ng the
                        students whom they are charged to instruct, and some of whom have not at the
                        present moment become sufficiently acquainted with our language to translate
                        accurately the manvals from which they derive the notes for their
                        lectures.</p>
                    <p>I have seen broken one by one, before the disdainful resistance of the
                        advisor, all my efforts to improve the professional culture of this staff,
                        by making them specialise, by removing from their shoulders a number of
                        courses whose preparation was materially impossible, by developing emulation
                        through the attraction of advancement by choice, by removing the causes
                        which induced the English "mistress" to leave the school before they had
                        learned sufficient French law to be able to force the --doors of the
                        Egyptian magistrature.</p>
                    <p>While a prudent and benevolent practice of discipline would have been
                        necessary to avoid exasperating the legitimate discontent caused by this
                        decadence of teaching among a body of students whom the movement of
                        intellectual awakening which is arousing their country at this moment has
                        galvanised and rendered avid of culture, Mr. Danlop has subjected students
                        arrived at the age of manhood, often married, sometimes fathers of families,
                        to the same disciplinary regulations as the children in the primary schools,
                        and has adopted in their regard a policy of pin pricks and patty persecu.
                        tions. The result of this procedure was to throw into the arms of the
                        anti-English opposition the intellectual élite who were being prepared by
                        their education to become a factor of perce and of Europeanisation ; to
                        engender in the hearts of these young men a hatred of the British
                        administration, and to transform the School of Law into a veritable seminary
                        of Egyptian nationalism, so that among an actual attendance of 400 pupils,
                        one would with difficulty find a dozen not entirely devoted to the doctrines
                        of Moustafa Kamel Pasha. In vain have I essayed to open the eyes of the
                        British Adviser to the dangers of his system of educational rnle. I have
                        been able to obtain from him no more than momentary concessions, and never
                        the sincere and definite abandonment of his regime of systematic vexations
                        and anhoyanoes. I could not under these condi. tions dissimulate the fact
                        that the irritative action of Mr. Danlop would sooner or later produce the
                        explosion in my school of new tempests more redoubtable than that which had
                        burst forth in 1906, and for which I was in danger of being made responsible
                        by Egyptian opinion </p>
                    <p>Mo Dunlop, in fine, submitted my dignity to a very painful trial, in
                        reserving for me and despite myself a role in the mystifications which he
                        organizes against a native minister F. E. Sand Pasha Zaghlool, who having
                        been appointed by the British Agency under the pressure of public opinion
                        has not been content to remain a simple manikin. To reduce this spoil-sport
                        to impotence the English Adviser compelled the principal functionation of
                        the <cb n="5"/> Ministry of Public Instruction to join in forming a sort of
                        league intended to parylene the action of their official chief. I was not
                        authorised any more than my collongues to remain neutral. Alter dictating to
                        me the out. line of my official reports, Mr. Dunlop obliged me to submit
                        them to his corrections before addressing them to the minister; sometimes
                        even I had to altor after the event, and according to the indications of the
                        Adviser's documents alrendy issued from my Office and registered in the
                        Ministry. These acts of compliance, already very annoying, were considered
                        insufici. ent. To remain longer the collaborator of Mr. Dunlop I should have
                        to consent to a sacrifice of conscience more humiliating still, and to
                        expose myself to the risks of being caught at every-instant, in flagrante
                        delicts" of betrayal, by H.E. Sand Pasha Zaghlool. My relations with Mr.
                        Dunlop who, for the various reasons I have already enumerated, showed
                        towards me marked signs of unfriendliness, became more difficult on account
                        of a disagreement as to the recruitment of professors. </p>
                    <p>In order to replace three professors who were leaving and so as to provide
                        for an increase in the number of technical classes according to a new law
                        which had been promulgated, I was obliged to ask for the engagement for
                        1907-8 of at least two new collaborators. After having promised me formarly
                        to give his permission, Mr. Dunlop withdrew his acquiescence because the
                        turn politics were taking did not allow him to import further European
                        professors, and because he would on no account allow the intrusion of
                        Egyptians in the teaching staff of the school. </p>
                    <p>I refused to agree with this excuse "cette fin de non recevoir tardive" and I
                        was able, thanks to a highly-placed English official, to impose upon Mr.
                        Danlop the nomination of two Egyptian tenchers. Although in order to obtain
                        this result, I was obliged to give my consent to important concessions and,
                        above all, to agree to give an unfavorable report concerning all the
                        candidates who might apply for admission as teachers in response to the
                        Appeal the Minister of Public Instruction bad minde in the "Journal
                        Officiel" for the collabor ation of Egyptians, Mr. Dunlop never forgave me
                        this act of independence. He submitted me in my turn to the policy of
                        "bullying" with which my predecessor had already been acquainted.</p>
                    <p>Then it was that, having used np my last means of Defence and convinced that
                        I chald no longer do anything to protect my staff and my students against
                        the Adviser's anger. I resigned myself to the eventuality of an-early
                        departure. A joke of a particularly doubtful character, and which thanks to
                        the publicity given it by Mr Dunlop, did not enable me to endure it without
                        losing all consideration in the eyes of my collaborators or pupils, hastened
                        my de. cision, I tendered my resignation. It was Accepted with enthusiasm
                        and the following day already, I was replaced by an English professor, whose
                        right to succeed mo has been concretely defined in a sentence attributed
                        either tightly or wrongly to Sir Bldon Gorst : "Mr. Hill is an ignoramus;
                        all the better, he will be docile." Some of my compatriots in Cairo
                        reproached me for having sacrificed the superior interests of France to
                        satisfy the soraples of my conscience, abandoning, with a view to avoid
                        accomplishing a task which appeared to me to be repugnant, one of the
                        highest posts in Egyptian educational institutions, and one which up to the
                        present had been monopolised by Frenchmen. I cannot agree with their
                        particular conception of French interests. As regards French interests in
                        the East, they were furthered by men like Vidal Pasha and Testoud who
                        governed the Khedivial School of Law when the directors had their hands free
                        and could work for the propagation of our juridical science. But the
                        upholding of our prestige in Egypt can only be compromised if French
                        university professors consent to hide beneath the folds of their togas, the
                        work of intel." lectual strangulation pursued by Mr. Danlop. Nor must we
                        dissimulate that we have no chance of being able to conserve a
                        representation however menger on the educational staffs of official Egyptian
                        institutions. A few years agd we would still have been able to defend
                        ourselves. To-day it is too late. Oor defeat has been accomplished and last
                        triomph has crowned the anti-French policy of Mr. Dunlop, by the recent
                        publication of a Khedivial deoree definitely suppressing the first year of
                        French in the only secondary school in Cairo where it still existed, namely
                        the Towfikieh School. 1 Consequently, in four years French will have
                        disappeared as a teaching medium in all Government establishments, and the
                        liquidation of the French section in the Khedivial School of Law will have
                        begun. We cannot, as regards the future, maintain our intellectual influence
                        except by the exploit. tation in our free educational institutions of the
                        errors of the British school policy. We possess in Cairo a French
                        law-school. In order to attract to its classes the immense majority of the
                        notable pupils of the Khedivial School of Law, it would be sufficient to
                        harmonise our curricula and our methods with the national requirements of
                        Egypt, to utilise Egyptians of competence, especially specialists in Moslem
                        law, to send official examiners such as are sent to our Medical College in
                        Beyrouth and to organise preparatory French classes, It is very improbable
                        that we shall ever be able to find a more propitious opportunity for
                        reconstituting the monopoly of Law.eduon tion which was torn from onr hands
                        in 1899. </p>
