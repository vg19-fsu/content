                    <head>THE EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND.</head>
                    <p>The lecture which Professor Naville delivered on Monday evening last week at
                        King's Collage on his fourteen years' work on the exploration of the great
                        Hathor temples at Deir-el-Bahari was, says Mr. W. St Chad Bosoawen in the
                        "Globe," an addres of great importance, not only on account of the
                        archeologial matter, but also on account of the statements he made at the
                        close as to the future plans of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. In his
                        discourse the lecturer traced the progress of the work from the first
                        commencement in 1898 to ita conclusion in 1907, and as the various stages of
                        work were explained and the progress made illustrated by beautiful
                        photographs, it was made clear what a great work had been accomplished. When
                        Mariette gave up his work none of the greattemple was clear except the
                        forecourt. The remains of the colonnades, the shrines, and the great alter
                        were all hidden beneath tons of débris and landslips from the great western
                        mountain. In addition, the remains of a Coptic monastery and village filled
                        the portions above ground. This applied to the great temple built for
                        Hatsbepsn by the architect Senmut The very existence of the older temple of
                        the eleventh dynasty built by Mentuhetep, and the shrines of the Hathor Cow,
                        one of the moat important discoveries ever made, on which Professor Naville
                        waxed justly eloquent, was quite unsnspected. The work of the daring of the
                        old temple belongs to years ago, in the present rapid progress of events;
                        but there was one spécial point of interest which the lecturer referred to,
                        and which was oertainly new. In the forecourt at the top of. the camp
                        leading up from the plain was discovered an immense aquare altar, approached
                        by steps. As the Egyptians did not use burnt offerings, its use was obscure,
                        but Professor Naville showed that it resembled the great altars shown in the
                        sculptures of Ankh-en Aten, at Tel-el- Amarna-which were piled with flowers,
                        fruits, and various offerings of bread-cakes and other objects what time the
                        King amended to offer his prayer to the noonday sun. When concluding his
                        remarks on the exploration of the eighteenth dynasty temple, the lecturer
                        showed a photograph of the absolutely cleared and partially restored
                        building, and remarked, "that it was now in a much better condition than it
                        had ever been sinoe the latter days of ths Egyptian Empire." For he said the
                        Egyptians seldom or ever repaired a building, and more frequently when in
                        partial decay it became a quarry for the workmen of later times. This had
                        certainly been the fate of the older temple which preceded the building of
                        the great queen. This work had occupied ten years. Passing now to the work
                        on the older temple, buried benrath mounds of débris only partially natural,
                        the lecturer brought out many most important points hitherto unknown, and
                        especially interested his audience by exhibiting photographs of many of the
                        sculptures retained at Cairo. Among these were a beautifnl painted portrait
                        group of Mentuhetep and his negro queen. There is also another interesting
                        group of one of the queens seated on a throne and receiving offerings of
                        milk and cakes from attendants, while two waiting maids plait her hair and
                        put the hairpins in it; certainly the earliest picture of an early
                        breakfast. The king, Professor Naville said, was a polygamist, two wives
                        being priestesses of Hathor, and they were buried in tombs in a courtyard
                        behind the pyramid and beautifully decorated shrines erected in the
                        colonnade above the tombs. The lecturer showed photographs of the very
                        beautiful sarcophagus of Prinoea or Queen Kareit now at Cairo. Professor
                        Naville devoted much time to the account of the discovery of the perfect
                        shrine of the goddess Hathor, under the form of a cowwhich has been so often
                        described. He mentions that careful rosearch had shown that there was a
                        distinct association between the Hathor cow and the Apis bull. He had said
                        that the peculiar markings on the body of the cow were not stars, as at
                        first supposed, but leaves of a "four - leafed clover." Is this another
                        proof of the antiquity of the shamrock? The most important point in the
                        lecture was Professor Naville's exposition of the questions of the King's
                        tomb. He showed most clearly that the great vaulted passage extending five
                        hundred feet into the mountain could not be the tomb; but rather that great
                        alabaster shrine, with its red granite roof, was, the chamber of the Ca, or
                        double of the king, which was worshipped by the later kings Usertesen,
                        Amenophis II., and others. He then proceedod to show that there was much
                        evidence to identify tho tomb with that found in the south-west corner of
                        the court by Lord Dufferin in 1889, which Dr. Naville cleared again, and in
                        which he found a large uninscribed sarcophagus. In the course of the
                        lecture, Professor Naville referred to the great help he had received from
                        Mr. Hall, of the British Museum, and Mr. Aryton. The most important
                        statement of all came at the conclusion of this interesting lecture. Mr.
                        Naville, in speaking of the future work of the Egypt Exploration Fund, said
                        that it was feared that the intended excavations at Abydos would have to be
                        given up this season. The work on Deir-el-Bahari had costt so many thousands
                        of pounds that unless subscriptions were forthcoming, a season's rest would
                        be necessary. Surely there must be many who, while unable to visit Nile
                        land, have had its best art and literature brought to them year after year
                        by the Fund, who would contribute their guinea, or as much more as they
                        like, in order that this should be remedied, and the twenty-five years work
                        be continued. </p>

                        <head>A Faithless Husband</head>
                        <p>A Cairo Bey, rich and well known in the district, two years ago married
                            an Israelite dancer named Latifa,and handsomely furnished for her a flat
                            at Daher. Unhappily the fickle nature of the Bey was not proof against
                            the blandishments of other artistes and his infidelity was the cause of
                            many domestic squabbles. These only served to exasperate the husband
                            with the result that, he completely deserted the home. On Monday
                            morning, accompanied by a servant and several porters, he went to the
                            house, and expressed his intention of taking away the household goods.
                            This procedure the wife energetically opposed, and her cries soon
                            brought several Israelites on the scene. One, a certain Leon Sion,
                            interfered and a sharp combat followed, during which Leon Sion stabbed
                            the servant with a knife. Meanwhile Mahmoud found means of informing the
                            police, who, after considerable difficulty stopped the fray, and
                            arrested Leon Sion, consigning him to the French Consulate, and
                            transporting the wounded servant to the hospital, where he lies in a
                            grave condition. </p>

                        enjoying the change. The weather is very fine just now and Geneva as
                        charming as ever. The Parc des Eaux Vives is only a quarter of an hour's
                        walk along the shore of Lake Leinan, and is the fashionable resort daily
                        during the summer for visitors to Geneva. The grounds are magnificent and
                        the specimens of trees from different parts of the world to say nothing of
                        the assortment of beautiful flowers and plants, are an endlçss source of
                        enjoyment to all lovers of nature. There is a first class restaurant with an
                        excellent cuisine. Tea and coffee are served at small tables in the park
                        under the shelter of the trees. A fine orchestra plays daily and just now
                        there is an open air theatre with performances every afternoon and evening,
                        and plenty of scope for sport of all kinds. </p>

                        Alexandria during the year 1906 was 3,695,829 tons. In 1903 the total

                        Belgian, Austro-Hungarian, Danish and Ottoman shipping have increased in
                        varying degrees. British shipping claims 1,473,087 tone, or 40 per cent of
                        the total amount, and more than the Ottoman, Anstro-Hungarian, Italian and
                        French shipping combined. , There has, nevertheless, been a decrease in
                        British shipping of 48,792 tons as compared with the year 1905, whereas the
                        average yearly increase during the five preceding years was 99,809 tons.
                        Ottoman shipping, as in 1905, occupies the second place with 344,238 tons,
                        or abont 9 per cent of the shipping of the port, representing an increase of
                        4,003 tons during the year. The average yearly increase during the five
                        preceding years was 32,868 tons. Austro-Hungarian shipping, which occupied
                        the fifth place in 1905, has risen above France and Italy to the third place
                        with a total of 325,549 tons, or 9 per cent of the tonnage of the port, and
                        has realised an increase of 14,881 tons, the average yearly increase for the
                        five preceding years having been 12,357 tons. Italian shipping, which
                        occupied the third place last year, now stands fourth, having yielded a
                        place to Austria Hungary, with 323,942 tons, or 9 per cent of the shipping
                        of the port, but has sustained a decrease of 8,342 tons. French shipping,
                        which held the fourth place in 1905, having likewise been passed by
                        Austra-Hungary, now stands fifth with 315,500 tons, or 9 per cent of the
                        port, and has sustained a decreas of 9,629 tons as compared with 1906, the
                        average yearly increase during the five preceding years having been 6,697
                        tons. German shipping holds the sixth place with 296,647 tons, or 8 per
                        cent, of the total tonnage of the port as compared with 7 percent for 905
                        and 4 percent for 904. There has been an increase daring the past year of
                        34,976 tons, the average yearly increase during the five preceding years
                        having been 40,442 tons. Greek shipping has risen from the eighth to the
                        seventh place with a tonnage of 241,290 tons,or 6 percent of the tonnage of
                        the port, as compared with 6 per cent for 1908, 4 per cent, for 1904, 3 per
                        cent for 1908 and 2 percent in 1902. It has shown the considerable increase
                        of 68,229 tons during the year, the average yearly increase during the five
                        years preceding having been 18,510 tons. Russian shipping occupies the
                        eighth place with 176,819 tons, or 5 per cent of the total shipping of the
                        port. Belgian shipping has risen from the tenth to the ninth place with
                        63,628 tons, or 2 per cent of the tonnage of the port as compared with 1 per
                        cent, in 1905. It has increased by the considerable amount of 29,267 tons
                        during the past year, the average yearly increase for the five preceding
                        years having been 2,083 tons. Danish shipping occupies the tenth place with
                        86,785 tons, as compared with 10,996 tons in 1900 and 23,052 tons in 1905.
                        It has increased by 12,733 tons during the past year. Swedish and Norwegian
                        shipping accounted for 32,736 and 25,871 tons, respectively. Their tonnage
                        united' fall slightly short of their combined tonnage for 1905 Dutch
                        shipping claims 15,634 tons, or 2,772 tons, more than in 1905. Roumanian
                        shipping, unrepresented in 1905, contributed 12,811 tons. This is due to the
                        service organised by the Rouinainian Maritime Company between Constanza and
                        this port. Cyprus has during the past year been connected with Alexandria by
                        a regular weekly mail service organised by the Limassol Steamship Company. A
                        British maritime enterprise of the near future will be the service of the
                        Egyptian Mail Steamship Company between Marseilles and Alexandria A French
                        company too, is said to be studying the question of a service from Dunkerque
                        to Alexandria, touching possibly at Havre, Tangier, Oran, Algiers and Tonis.

                        number of buildings which have collapsed in Alexandria, Cairo and their

                        whether in view of the fact that a number of houses in Cairo, near the
                        Boghoa Paaha bridge, are without water supply, and that the Cairo Water

                    <head>AT THE ASSUAN DAM.<lb/>A WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION.</head>
                    <p>Writing on the 19th inst. a.correspondent of "Pall Mall Gazette" says :-
                        After an absence of quite eighteen months, I find myself again at Assuan,
                        and, perforce, I have paid a visit to the Dam. I was exceedingly surprised
                        at the transformation achieved on the west side of that marvellous
                        structure. There is, as before very little to interest the eye on the drive
                        out, which takes about thirty minutes from the time of leaving the hotel.
                        The way leads across the sandy expanse which, broken here and there by
                        overpoweringly high masses of sandstone and granite, causes the casual
                        observer to imagine he is traversing the scene of some prehistoric volcanic
                        upheaval But on a closer observation one sees in the formation and lay of
                        the rocks that the right bank was in reality in former times the bed of a
                        river, forming, in all probability, an outlet or tributary to the great
                        inland sea, which is said by the geologists to have existed in the Sahara
                        Desert At the reservoir there is quite a little colony. Where, a little over
                        a year ago, only a relentless stretch of sand existed, there appear now
                        numbers of neat and cool-looking buildings, standing in their own grounds,
                        which are developing into produce-bearing and shade-providing gardens,
                        affording a restful spot on which the eye, tired with the glare of the sun
                        and the surrounding desert, can repose. These houses are the residences of
                        the officials attached to the Dam, and of the engineers engaged on the new
                        works. I entered one of them, and found it delightfully cool and
                        comfortable, fitted with electric light and various conveniences with which
                        the ordinary resident has to dispense. Some of the houses are excellently
                        situated, standing at the summit of a series of terraces covered with the
                        green plant, which out here cakes the place of turf. All this shows the
                        richness of Egypt's soi!, and proves that with care and attention even the
                        sand can be made fruitful. I do not mean that the sand alone can be
                        transformed. What I intend to convey is the fact that with modem appliances
                        and careful supervision no spot in Egypt need be barren. At present it is
                        rather a critical time in Assuan from a hygienic point of view. It is the
                        period of the green water, a stretch of water computed to be 500 miles in
                        length, and containing a fungus whose colour gives the name to the water.
                        This piece of water takes from seven to fourteen days to pass Assuan, aud
                        during that time it is extremely dangerous to drink the water, As it brings
                        on fever and colic. The smell is also most offensive. The residents at the
                        Dam get the full benefit of this water, if one may call it benefit, and at
                        present they do not feel over happy at their lot But in time all this will
                        be a thing of the past, and I feel quite loth to leave what appears to be,
                        and certainly is, a delighful spot to reside in </p>

                        PRAISE</head>
                    <p>As announoed in our cable of the 31st ult the Royal Message recommending the
                        grant of £50,000 to the . Earl of Cromer for his great services to Egypt was
                        discussed in both houses of Parliament on Tuesday week. In the House of
                        Lords, the Marquess of Ripon, (Lord Privy Seal).in moving that their
                        lordships concur with the Commons in making the grant, said :- It is with
                        great personal gratification that I rise to perform the duty which falls to
                        my lot on this occasion. Lord Cromer's great services are so well known to
                        your lordships and to his countrymen, that it would be out of place, and
                        almost waste of time, if I were to go through any lengthy description of
                        them now. The great success of Lord Cromer's administration in Egypt has
                        afforded justification for the belief that Englishmen are eminently
                        qualified for the administration of affairs in any part of the world, and on
                        behalf of any nation. During the 24 years in which my noble friend has been
                        at the head of Egyptian administration, he has done a work of infinite
                        difficulty and of the highest importance-a work beneficial to the people of
                        that country, bringing order out of chaos and laying firm and solid the
                        foundation of a prosperity calculated to confer much honour upon the British
                        name. To most of us here, and to many outside the House, Lord Cromer's name
                        is chiefly connected with the great work which he has done in Egypt, but it
                        would be a great mistake to suppose that his services have been entirely
                        confined to that country. Lord Cromer was trained in a good school of
                        administration. He was private secretary to my noble friend the late Lord
                        Northbrook, and I had the advantage of having Lord Cromer as a financial
                        member of the Indian Council during the chief part of the time that I had
                        the honour to fill the office of Viceroy of India, I was able then to watch,
                        from day to day, his devotion to duty, his firm grasp of financial
                        principles, and his high administrative ability. It is, therefore, with no
                        hesitation that I submit to. you a resolution, and ask you to express to the
                        Sovereign your readiness to concur in doing an honoor to one who has
                        rendered services alike to the Crown and the people of this country (hear.
                        hear). A recognition such as that which it is intended to be offered to Lord
                        Cromer has very generally been confined to members of the naval and military
                        services, but I rejoice that upon this occasion, we are about to concur in
                        conferring a similar honor upon one whose services have been of a civil
                        nature. I think that we shall do well if we do not hesitate to place Lord
                        Cromer in the same position and on perfect equality with the eminent
                        soldiers and sailors who have been honoured in this way, I therefore beg
                        to.move :- "That an humble address of concurrence and thanks be addressed to
                        his Majesty in answer to his most gracious message" (cheers). The Marquess
                        of lansdowne.-We, on this side of the House, do not yield to noble lords
                        opposite in our appreciation of Lord Cromer's services, and we desire to
                        associate ourselves with all that has been said by the noble marquess, and
                        to accept our full share of responsibility for the proposal which the
                        Government has made. Lord Cromer has, indeed, conferred signal services upon
                        this country, and upon the Empire. I was glad that the noble marquess
                        reminded us that, although we are apt to connect Lord Cromer's name almost
                        exclusively with Egypt, it was not in Egypt alone that Lord Cromer did good
                        work for his country. I can well remember the reputation which Lord Cromer
                        left behind him in India as financial member of the Council but it is upon
                        Egypt that Lord Cromer has left an indelible mark, and it is the affairs of
                        Egypt which have ennabled him to write a page in the history of this country
                        which is all his own. On such an occasion as this one is apt to look for a
                        parallel, but I really believe there is no case which stands exactly on all
                        fours with that-.of Lord Cromer. Our position in Egypt is an altogether
                        exceptional position, and Lord Cromer's position in that country was also
                        exceptional. I think that it would be almost true to say of him that during
                        his long term of office he was able to serve two masters with equal fidelity
                        and success. Of British interests he was a watchful custodian. Nobody need
                        be reininded of the nature of British interests in Egypt. It is due to Lord
                        Cromer that our position in that country, at one time undefined, and,
                        indeed, somewhat precarious, became assured and consolidated. </p>

                    <p>But if Lord Cromer was the faithful guardian of British interests he was not
                        a less faithful guardian of the interests of the country committed to his
                        charge. Nothing could have been more whole hearted than his devotion to
                        Egyptian interests, and his work, when one comes to review it, was, indeed,
                        a marvellous achievement in the interests of Egypt We see how, under his
                        guidance, the great natural resources of that country were developed, and
                        when we consider the manner in which he was able place its finances upon a
                        sound footing; when we remember how every branch of Egyptian administration
                        has, during his tenure of office, been put upon a sounder footing, we may
                        indeed claim for him that, under the geidanoe of no other man, could so much
                        have been done for the people of Egypt I daresay many of your lordships may
                        have, from time to time, perused those admirable reports which every year
                        Lord Cromer was in the habit of submitting to the Foreign Office. I have
                        never read them without profound admiration and without feeling that this
                        country might indeed be prond that we had such a man as Lord Cromer to
                        represent us in other ports of the world. But although the public generally
                        has been well aware of the magnitude of Lord Cromer's achievements, although
                        it has, so to speak, seen the great output of work of which he was the
                        author, it was reserved for those behind the scenes, who know the conditions
                        under which that work was performed, to know in the face of what great
                        difficulties, in the face of what apparently insuperable obstacles that task
                        was so admirably accomplished. Lord Cromer had to contend with many
                        disappointments; he had to overcome many rivalries, but he triumphed over
                        them all, because he possessed in the highest degree two great qualities
                        indispensable in a public man-the qualities of tact and tenacity. It would
                        be unjust to Lord Cromer if I did not refer to my conviction that the
                        satisfactory understanding obtained by the late Government with France in
                        regard to many outstanding questions and notably with regard to Egyptian
                        affairs, would not have been obtainable, or, at all events, attainable upon
                        so satisfactory a basis, if it had not been for the exceptional position
                        which Lord Cromer occupied among the representatives of the other Great
                        Powers in Egypt In this House, at any rate, I am sure that no discordant
                        note will be raised whan we consider the proposal laid before us by the
                        noble Marquees (hear, hear). We feel that this proposed grant is no
                        excessive reward for those great public services, and we trust that it may
                        enable Lord Cromer to enjoy the well earned rest which we hope he will take
                        after the labours which it is well known have involved every serious strain
                        upon his health. We trust that he may live long to see others carry out the
                        great work which will always be associated with his name (cheers). The
                        motion was then agreed to. </p>

                    <p>There was a very large attendance when the Premier, Sir Henry Campbell
                        BanDerman, opened the debate in the House of Commons Hebsaid :- Hitherto
                        such grants have, with some exceptions, been confined to those who have
                        performed conspicuous service to the country in war, but I do not imagine
                        that in this House of Commons there will be many who would wish to exclude
                        from tangible acknowledgment the quieter and less resounding, but not less
                        useful or lees deserving services of pacific administration (hear hear). It
                        would not be too much to say that of all our pacific administrators
                        throughout the Empire of the present. day, Lord Cromer is the foremost
                        man-foremost in courage, wisdom, resource, and patience, and foremost, too,
                        by the splendid results he has obtained (hear, hear). It is not in Egypt
                        only that he has done great service. Before his career there commenced be
                        had done work in India the effect of which is felt to this day. We all know
                        how. Lord Cromer's administration of the affairs of Egypt has been marked by
                        striking material progress, but his countrymen are even prouder of the
                        security and liberty which his labour secured-of the revival of justice and
                        work he did for education. When we reflect that 24 years ago, when he began
                        this task, Egypt was bankrupt, and almost effaced under the burden of
                        taxation and indebtedness, and that all his efforts for .reform had to be
                        carried out under a system surely the most grievous to be borne that ever
                        hampered an administrator, it is difficult to find words in which to express
                        the admiration we feel for his steadfastness and courage. </p>

                    <head>REGENERATION OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>Lord Cromer belongs to the school that holds it wise to hasten slowly if
                        superimposing the civilisation of one race upon another. He profoundly
                        disbelieved in any attempt to force the Egyptian people into Western mould.
                        If he had cared to dazzle the world with swift and sensational results,
                        there were plenty, of capitalists ready to go up and develop Egypt on the
                        lines of European finance, and Lord Cromer would have saved himself infinite
                        trouble if he had accepted their assistance and yielded to pressure and let
                        them in. But he saw that the regeneration of Egypt could only be effected
                        through the Egyptians themselves, and in devising measures for the
                        emancipation of the peasantry from the bondage of debt and preserving them
                        in their holdings, he laid the foundation of an agrarian policy which is the
                        foundation of the future Egypt. That policy, entitles him to the gratitude
                        of the country he has served so well, and to the admiration and respect of
                        his countrymen. In losing him we lose a public servant who in all the
                        anxious and harassing events and complications associated with Egypt has
                        been a tower of strength, and whose courage, resource and wisdom, and
                        loyalty have never failed. Now that he hs come home broken in health, having
                        spent his strength and his fortune in the public service (hear, hear), I
                        believe that, in showing him this mark of esteem, we shall not only be
                        honouring a great man who has greatly served his country, but we shall he
                        enabling the country and the Empire through this House, to recognise, as
                        they desire, the debt they owe to Lord Cromer (cheers). </p>

                    <head>MR. BALFOUR'S TESTIMONY</head>
                    <p>Mr. Balfour (U., City of London) - My friends and I are anxious to give the
                        government wholehearted support in the course they are pursueing (hear,
                        hear) - a course which is consistent with the honour of the country and with
                        .the traditions of the House (cheers). This is the first time, so far as I
                        know, that the House of Commons has been asked to vote to a civil servant
                        any great mark of national gratitude, But Lord Cromer belongs to a different
                        class from that of other civil servants, however distinguished their
                        services. We have before us in Egypt the fruits of the work of one great
                        men. It stands out as isolated and singular a work of genius as the more
                        sudden glories of some great military triumph, and, is separated from the
                        ordinary work of even the greatest of the great race of civil servants
                        abroad who have done such inestimable service to the British Empire by
                        special charicteristics which mark it off and render it matter for
                        differential treatment (cheers). Within a quarter of a century Lord Cromer
                        has raised Egypt from the lowest pitch of social and economic degradation
                        until it now stands among Oriental nations, I believe, absolutely alone in
                        its prosperity. Everything he has touched he has succeeded in. Every cause
                        he has taken in hand he has furthered. He leaves Egypt able to look back
                        upon an administration longer, more beneficent, and more fruitful than,
                        perhaps, can be boasted by any one of those great predecessors who have
                        carried out great civilising work among races who have not risen to the
                        level of those whose lot it has been to govern them. The difficulty of
                        governing races in these conditions is great, and requires sympathy,
                        courage, and steadfastness. Lord Cromer has all these qualities. He has
                        dealt successfully with diplomatic and social difficulties in a manner which
                        has earned the permanent gratitude of the Egyptian people, and which is well
                        deserving of some distinguished mark of the gratitnde which this House and
                        the country owe to one of the greatest of their servants (cheers). </p>

                    <head>THE HOME PRESS ON THE GRANT.</head>
                    <p>The press at home is unanimous in approving the grant to the Earl of Cromer,
                        and refers in glowing terms to his splendid work in Egypt We append a few
                        excerpts : "Times" We have lavished rewards upon the sailors and the
                        soldiers who have led our fleets and our armies to victory, but no exact
                        precedent has been found for the acknowledgment, by a grant of public
                        moneys, of such inestimable services to England as Lord Cromer has rendered
                        her. The grant to Sir Rowland Hill was the nearest case which could be
                        discovered, but the resemblance between the circumstances in which it was
                        made and those of the present vote is not very close. Lord Ripon said that,
                        had no precedent existed, he should have been glad to create one, and, in
                        effect, that is what the Government have done. We congratulate them upon
                        their action and upon its exceptional timeliness. It is meet and wise that a
                        nation such as ours should pay homage to splendid achievements in other
                        fields than in the field of war. They demand gifts not less rare, labours as
                        arduous and more prolonged, and courage equally high. At a time when the
                        mind of the whole world is. bent on furthering the cause of peace, it is
                        particularly becoming that the nation which has so often proclaimed its zeal
                        for that cause should bestow a signal mark of its favour upon a statesman
                        whose life work has been a work of peace. Lord Lansdowne, who followed the
                        leader of the House, called to mind tho difficulties and the obstacles under
                        which that work was accomplished. The greatness of the felicitations of the
                        whole world. Lord Cromer's character lies in this, that, whatever secret
                        cares and anxieties they laid upon him, he never suffered them to divert his
                        course from the goal he had set himself to reach. It has been his happiness
                        to reach that goal amidst the felicitations of the whole world. It remained
                        for his Sovereign and his countrymen to confer upon him a material token of
                        the deep appreciation they entertain of his achievements, and they have
                        discharged this duty to themselfes and to him by the vote of last night. The
                        work, which Lord Cromer has done is there for all the world to see; all the
                        world has looked upon it, and has declared with one accord that it is good. </p>
                    <p>"DAILY TELEGRAPH"</p>
                    <p>There have been few periods within the last thirty years at which Lord Cromer
                        could not have honourably enriched himself by quitting the responsible post
                        in the occupation of which he did such invaluable work, both for the Empire
                        and for the people of Egypt. As a reward for his great services the sum of
                        fifty thousand pounds is but paltry, though it is understood that it
                        represents the maximum the great Proconsul would accept Lord Cromer will
                        value far more than this provision for his retirement the tributes paid to
                        his achievements by the representatives of both the great parties in the
                        State, who alone could appreciate them at their full value. It was a happy
                        incident that the two leaders in the House of Lords, Lord Ripon and Lord
                        Lansdownes, should have been in a position to bear testimony to Lord
                        Cromer's work in India, before he had been transferred to the fuel in which
                        he won his proudest laurels. </p>
                    <p>"TRIBUNE</p>
                    <p>In conferring a signal honour upon Lord Cromer Parliament has been truly
                        representitive of a grateful nation. The system of presenting testimonials
                        upon their retirement to men who have done good work and earned general
                        esteem has, perhaps, shown signs of brief rather overdone in many minor
                        spheres of British life; it may have become a little too like a matter of
                        course that the clock or the service of plate or purse shall be the natural
                        sequel of a long spell of parish work or the smoothly successful discharge
                        of business duties. But it is not so at the top, in the big affairs of the
                        Empire. There the grant is a rare event, reserved for extraordinary
                        services. Lord Cromer is one of the very few who have had the opportunity to
                        do conspicuously extraordinary work on the peaceful side, and of the still
                        fewer who have surpassed all expectations and confounded all apparent
                        probabilities by the manner in which such opportunity has been grasped. He
                        has done not a little for the peace of the whole world, since, as was well
                        said last night, his Egyptian career undoubtedly helped to make possible the
                        cleaning of the slate as between England and France, and warm friendship now
                        established. </p>
                    <p>"DAILY CHRONICLE"</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's powers of mind and character were singularly adapted to the
                        conditions in which Egypt stood for many years after he took office. If the
                        conditions have changed, the change is chiefly due to his own high services,
                        and it would be absurdly unfair to make light of what he has done because
                        the prosperity which he has produced may call for an advance in the methods
                        of government. </p>

                        week. In Futures a small business has resulted; the following are the latest

                        been very quiet in tone, with only a very limited business doing outside of
                        the professional trading. There have been frequent moderate fluctuations and
                        to-day's prices are 7^ @ 8 points higher for the Current, month and August,
                        Septemher delivery, and 8J @ 4 points higher for the other positions, than
                        those of last Thursday. The slight improvement is more due to a certain
                        sensitiveness about the real condition of the Crop, because more or less the
                        weather has continued dry with high temperatures. There is not apparently so
                        far any serious anxiety, but there is anxiety of a kind. We are also

                                signed the Act of Algesiras, of the growing necessity of organising
                                the police in the Morocco ports, affirming that France is resolutely
                                determined to maintain the authority of the Sultan, and the
                                integrity of the empire, to assure of commercial transactions, the

                                The French representatives have handed to the signatories of the Act
                                of Algeciras a declaration declaring that events in Morocco had

                                the Consul and in concurrence with the Bashaw. They were proceeding
                                to the Consulate when they were tired upon by Moors whom they
                                repulsed with the bayonet. The "Galilée" and "Du t'hayla" then
                                bombarded the Moorish quarter and tribesmen on the beach with

                        has received the following telegram from the sleeping sickness expedition of
                        the school, which was sent to Africa early in May last:- "Send quantity

                        Trypanosomiasis Expedition, Broken Hill, N.W. Rhodesia." Atoxyl is the name
                        of the remedy recommended for therapeutical treatment in cases of sleeping
                        sickness. The sleeping sickness expedition arrivod at Kolomo on June 10,
                        where they were the guests of Mr. Codrington, the Administrator, who gave
                        every facility for their work. At the end of the present month it is
                        intended that Dr. Kinghorn, one of the members of the expedition, shall
                        proceed direct to Fort Jameson. Mr. Montgomery, the other member, will go
                        west to the River Kafne, and up that river towards the Congo. He will then
                        strike across the country, and meet Dr. Kinghorn on the river Luapaln about
                        November, traversing the whole of the time a territory infested by the T'se
                        T'se fly. One of the main objects of the expedition, which is financed by
                        the Liverpool School and supported by the British protectorates concerned
                        and the British South African Company, is to endeavour to prevent the spread
                        of sleeping sickness into districts hitherto uninfested. The expedition will
                        also study the disease on the spot, and will pay special attention to the
                        disease of animals and the distribution of biting flies. It is the fourth
                        expedition of the Liverpool School that has been sent to Africa to study
                        trypanosomiasis. </p>

                        cotton crop. It is impossible to estimate at the present moment the probable
                        requirements for this purpose, but all the imports from the cotton fields
                        foreshadow a splendid crop, so that the total imports of gold will
                        necessarily amount to a large figure, as we have said before, we have no
                        doubt that all the necessary accommodation will be obtained without serious
                        inconvenience to the money market. Several causes have contributed to the
                        heavy Call in the reserve reported this week, the chief of these being
                        demands for cash in connection with the holidays and end of month
                        requirements. The imports of gold from abroad amounted to £259,000, but
                        £862,000 in coin and £572,000 in notes went into circulation, with the
                        result that The reserve shows a decline of £1,181,667, at £24,867,412. This
                        compares with last year's total of £24,629,000. The proportion to
                        liabilities is 3/8 per cent lower on the week at 46 3/4 per cent, the
                        proportion at this period last year being 47.41 per oent The discount market
                        is firm, and three months bills were yesterday quoted 8, 11/16 to 3 3/4 per
                        cent In consequence of a large order from this Continent, the price of bar
                        gold has risen 7/8d. to 77/10 1/8. </p>
                    <p>Silver</p>
                    <p>During the greater part of the week the silver market remained quiet, but
                        strong buying yesterday sent the price up to 32, 1/16, the highest figure
                        touched for five months. </p>
                    <p>The Stock Market</p>
                    <p>Business on the Stock Exchange has become so scarce of late that many members
                        concluded this week that their time would be much more profitably spent on
                        the moor or by the sea, and the consequence has been that during the past
                        two or three days the "House" has had a somewhat deserted appearance.
                        Idleness has prevailed in most sections, and the tone has been anything but
                        satisfactory. It is gratifying to note, however that the Egyptian section
                        has been firm and that an appreciable amount of investment buying has been
                        going on. This bears out what we said last week, that the leading brokers
                        are taking an optimistic view of the trade troubles connected with the
                        crisis. The announcement that the assets of Messrs Salmi Brothers were
                        considerably in excess of the liabilities has had a reassuring effect, and
                        it is believed that in the case of Messrs Harriraan Brothers, whose
                        creditors meet next Wednesday the liabilities will not prove to be heavy.
                        Consols continue the most surprising feature olfmarkets, and it is quite
                        within the bounds of possibility that before the next settlement they will
                        be down to 80. Large quantities of the stock were delivered at the
                        settlement this week, and heavy buying on behalf of the Government has
                        totally failed to assist the market. </p>
                    <p>Consols</p>
                    <p>The premier security on Monday declined to 82 5/8, the lowest price touched
                        for over half a century. On Tuesday and Wednesday the market was firmer, but
                        yesterday there was a further loss of 3/8, the closing quotations being 82
                        5/8 for cash and 82, 18/16 for the account To-day Consols have improved 1/16
                        for the account </p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds</p>
                    <p>In the international market, the feature has been the weakness of the older
                        Japanese issues. A further decline of 1/4 yesterday put the 4 1/2 per cents,
                        down to 93 1/4 and 89 7/8 respectively, while the Pours were quoted 83.
                        Russians have also been sold, and the Fives relapsed to 83 3/4, the Fours
                        being down to 78 7/8. To-day Japanese have been irregular the new Fours have
                        shed 1/4, but two other issues are 1/8 better. </p>
                    <p>Home Ralls</p>
                    <p>The home railway market has been very flat, and prices have given way heavily
                        in spite of good traffics and excellent holiday prospects. The labour
                        agitation is exercising a depressing effect, as investors refuse to have
                        anything to do with these shares in the present state of unrest The
                        directors of the railways are adopting a firm attitude, which if pursued
                        must result in the employes moderating their demands. The possibility of a
                        strike Is remote, as the railwaymens' union represents only a small section
                        of the total employes. The Scotch shares Beem to be the only steady points.
                        Yesterday Caledonian Preference advanced 1, and North British Preference
                        1/2, but most of the heavies declined 1/2 to 1. Home rails show some
                        recovery to-day. There are several gains of ¼ to ½.</p>
                    <p>Americans.</p>
                    <p>Shares in the American railway section have moved rather irregularly, Wall
                        Street having been pessimistic regarding the future outlook. Yesterday the
                        market here was affected by uncertainty over the Pacific dividends, and
                        during the morning there was considerable selling of the leading shares.
                        Later the tone became firmer. In the "Street" it was announced that the
                        Southern Pacific dividend had been declared at the rate of 6 per cent as
                        against the previous distribution of 5 per cent, but that no action has been
                        taken with regard to the Union Pacific dividend. The news seemed to have
                        been fully discounted. Southern Pacific fell to 90 1/2, closing at 91 1/8,
                        while Unions left off at 145 5/8, alter being 145 1/4. The tone in Americana
                        has been better to-day. Unions have advanced 1/4. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians</p>
                    <p>Daring the greater part of the week prices in the Egyptian market have been
                        good, and there has been a fairly general advance all- round. The tone eased
                        off a little yesterday, but this is explained by the sparsity of business.
                        National Bank have been up to 201, closing tonight 19 5/8-7/8, and
                        Agricultural Bank, after beiug 8 1/4, close 8 1/16 8/16, but these prices
                        are well up on balance. Daira Sanieh, which have been fairly largely dealt
                        in, were quoted yesterday ex dividend, the Ordinary being 12 7/8 - 13 1/8 ex
                        25/-s., and the Deferred 65- 70 ex £10. Delta Land &amp; Investment after
                        changing hands at 2, are easiet at 1 7/8 offered, but Egyptian Estates are
                        firmer since the meeting at 5/8-3/4 Salt and Soda and Egyptian Markets have
                        been scarcely mentioned, closing unchanged at 13/16 and 1 3/8 respectively.
                        Union Foncier close 4 1/2 -3/4, and Khédivial Mail Ordinary are much letter
                        at 22/6-23/6. United Egyptian Lands are firmer at 3/8 - 1/3 and Corporation
                        of Westen Egypt are steady at 7/16-9/16. Anglrt-Egyptian Bank are still dull
                        at 12 5/8 - 7/8, but Land Banks are firm at 7-1/4. </p>
                    <p>Mining.</p>
                    <p>Liquidation from Paris has caused mining shares to be dull, and the market
                        has also suffered, in common with other sections, from lack of business. De
                        Beers were down to 22 3/4, a fall on the day of 5/16, while Premier were no
                        better than 9 S.S. at which they showed a loss of 1/4. Modderfontein gave
                        way 1/8 to 4 7/8, and Tanganyika 3/16 to 4, 7/16. To-day mines have been
                        idle Egyptian Mining shares are unmentioned, and prices show practically no
                        chage on the week.</p>

                        public ; recognising this a representative waited upon Miss Amy Corallie at
                        the Métropole Theatre, Birmingham, to gather some details of her career.
                        Miss Corallie - in private life Mrs. Finlay- is twenty-four, and has been
                        before the footlights since childhood. "Yes, I can spare a few minutes," she
                        said ; "time enough to tell of the good I derived from Dr. Williams' Pink
                        Pills for Pale People. "I have had the honour of appearing before Royalty,
                        and the late J. L. Toole often complimented me upon my stage work ; yet for
                        a long time I was acting under a positive prosecution. Sharp pains in my
                        back dragged me down ; sometimes I went to the theatre feeling more dead
                        than alive, with scarcely enough strength to drag one leg after the other.
                        My blood felt chilled ; rheumatic pains flew all over me, and my limbs
                        became almost useless. "I struggled against these ailments, but it was of
                        little use. My face grew pallid, and I felt entirely worn out, yet all night
                        long I scarcely closed my eyes in sleep. I lost all vitality, and felt
                        depressed and weary, while my memory failed. Food upset me, and I always had
                        a nasty taste in my mouth. "Friends noticed the change in me, for at the
                        least exertion I gasped for breath and my heart throbbed. Often I have
                        returned to the dressing room fainting and exhausted. Every noise got on my
                        nerves, and made me tremble from head to foot. "I took so many medicines
                        that my digestion was quite upset. Then fortunately I accepted the advice of
                        a friend, and tried Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Relief followed, and so I
                        continued with these pilla Then I improved rapidly, and soon could enjoy
                        meals without being tormented by indigestion. "My blood was nourished, and a
                        healthy colour returned. I felt more energetic in every way. My memory was
                        clear. I was quite a new woman in a few weeks after taking Dr Williams' Pink
                        Pills, never really tired, blessed with a healthy appetite, and able to
                        sleep well at night In my opinion Dr. Williams' Pink Pills build up the
                        brain as well as the body, blood and nerves." When the Blood becomes thin
